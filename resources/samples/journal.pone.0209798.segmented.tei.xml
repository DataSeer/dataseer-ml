               <p>
                  <s>Hendra virus (HeV) infection is endemic in Australian flying-fox populations.</s>
                  <s>Habitat loss has increased the peri-urban presence of flying-foxes, increasing the risk of contact and therefore viral ‘spillovers’ into horse and human populations.</s>
                  <s>An equine vaccine is available and horse-husbandry practices that minimize HeV exposure are encouraged, but their adoption is suboptimal.</s>
                  <s>Ecological approaches–such as habitat creation and conservation–could complement vaccination and behavioural strategies by reducing spillover risks, but these are controversial.</s>

               <p>
                  <s>We convened three community juries (two regional; one metropolitan) to elicit the views of well-informed citizens on the acceptability of adding ecological approaches to current interventions for HeV risk.</s>
                  <s>Thirty-one participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited using random-digit-dialling.</s>
                  <s>Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence, given time to ask questions of expert presenters and, after deliberation, come to well-reasoned conclusions.</s>

               <head>Results</head>
               <p>
                  <s>All juries voted unanimously that ecological strategies should be included in HeV risk management strategies but concluded that current interventions–including vaccination and changing horse-husbandry practices–must remain the priority.</s>
                  <s>The key reasons given for adopting ecological approaches were: (i) they address underlying drivers of disease emergence, (ii) the potential to prevent spillover of other bat-borne pathogens, and (iii) there would be broader community benefits.</s>
                  <s>Juries differed regarding the best mechanism to create/conserve flying-fox habitat: participants in regional centres favoured direct government action, whereas the metropolitan jury preferred to place the burden on landholders.</s>

                  <s>Informed citizens acknowledge the value of addressing the drivers of bat-borne infectious risks but differ substantially as to the best implementation strategies.</s>
                  <s>Ecological approaches to securing bat habitat could find broad social support in Australia, but disagreement about how best to achieve them indicates the need for negotiation with affected communities to co-develop fair, effective and locally appropriate policies.</s>

               <s>Hendra virus (HeV) infection is endemic in Australian flying-fox populations.</s>
               <s>Of the four flying-fox species native to Australia, the spectacled flying-fox ( <hi rend="italic">Pteropus conspicillatus</hi> ) and black flying-fox ( <hi rend="italic">Pteropus alecto</hi> ) are considered the most likely sources of equine HeV infections [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref001" type="bibr">1</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref002" type="bibr">2</ref> ].</s>
               <s>The current hypothesis is that the virus is transmitted to horses by mucous membrane exposure through the ingestion or inhalation of flying-fox excreta [most likely urine) from contaminated pasture or water [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref003" type="bibr">3</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref004" type="bibr">4</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Horses can shed virus before developing clinical signs and the presentation of HeV disease is highly variable, non-specific and difficult to interpret [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref005" type="bibr">5</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref006" type="bibr">6</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Horses also amplify the virus and can transmit HeV to other horses, dogs, and humans.</s>
               <s>While HeV infection appears to be relatively benign in domestic dogs, it causes catastrophic neurological and respiratory disease in humans and horses [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref007" type="bibr">7</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref008" type="bibr">8</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Since first characterised in 1994, there have been sporadic ‘spillover’ events in Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) during which more than 100 horses have died or been euthanized following diagnosis.</s>
               <s>The relative infectivity of known HeV strains is low–effective transmission requires close contact with the blood and/or bodily fluids of infected horses and many people have been exposed to HeV-infected horses without zoonotic transmission.</s>
               <s>Conversely HeV is highly virulent and the case fatality rate in humans is high–four of the seven cases have died [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref004" type="bibr">4</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Horses may shed virus up to three days before developing clinical signs and early clinical signs in the horse are considered non-specific.</s>
               <s>No therapeutics have been registered for human use but experimental monoclonal antibodies have been used as a compassionate treatment for individuals with high HeV risk exposures [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref009" type="bibr">9</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref010" type="bibr">10</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Not including the expense of managing human HeV cases and exposures, the cost and economic loss associated with each localised HeV outbreak has been estimated to be AUD $30,600 for each horse death [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref011" type="bibr">11</ref> ].</s>
            </p>
            <p>
               <s>Public health responses to HeV have focussed on education and behaviour modification amongst high-risk groups such as veterinarians, horse owners and people who work in equine industries [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref012" type="bibr">12</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Horse-husbandry practices that minimize the risk of HeV exposure–such as covering water troughs and fencing-off flowering and fruiting trees–have been widely publicised in the media and encouraged through targeted health and occupational safety messaging [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref013" type="bibr">13</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref014" type="bibr">14</ref> ].</s>
               <s>New occupational safety regulations were introduced, requiring veterinarians attending sick horses to wear personal protective equipment and restrict clinical care to minimally invasive emergency care until the animal has been tested negative of HeV infection [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref015" type="bibr">15</ref> ].</s>
               <s>This process can take 12–64 hours, depending on the day of the week and location [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref016" type="bibr">16</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Because of the human deaths–and after the unprecedented number of equine cases in 2011 –development of an HeV vaccine for horses was prioritised, became commercially available on a minor use permit in 2012, and gained full registration in 2015 [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref017" type="bibr">17</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Vaccination has been advocated and defended as the most effective way of reducing the risk of HeV in horses—a Queensland Parliamentary Inquiry in 2016 confirmed the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.</s>
               <s>It is estimated that approximately 14% of the total Australian horse population has been vaccinated with 500,000 doses administered to close to 150,000 horses.</s>
               <s>However vaccine uptake remains suboptimal—even in areas deemed to be at higher risk of HeV spillovers [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref018" type="bibr">18</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Factors driving resistance to use of the vaccine include horse owners’ concerns about vaccine cost, safety and its potential impact on equine performance [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref019" type="bibr">19</ref> – <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref021" type="bibr">21</ref> ].</s>
               <s>The adoption of safer horse-husbandry practices has also been less than ideal.</s>
               <s>Even though most owners appreciate the value of minimising the exposure of their horses to flying-foxes, many find the recommended changes to practices difficult to implement because of issues of practicality, the expense of introducing or changing infrastructure on their property, or both [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref014" type="bibr">14</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref018" type="bibr">18</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref022" type="bibr">22</ref> ].</s>
               <s>As horse-owner and community responses to the risks posed by HeV are variable–and the uptake of effective preventive interventions has been suboptimal–some veterinarians are refusing to attend unvaccinated horses, or are abandoning equine practice altogether because of overriding concerns for their personal safety and legal liability during HeV spillover events [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref023" type="bibr">23</ref> ].</s>
            </p>
            <p>
               <s>Climate change, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are key stressors that drive emergence of new infectious diseases from wild animal populations [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref024" type="bibr">24</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref025" type="bibr">25</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Queensland alone has lost 9.7 million hectares of forest through land clearing since the 1970s, with native vegetation cover reduced by at least 50% over the last 200 years [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref026" type="bibr">26</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Loss of habitat and depletion of native food sources contribute to flying-foxes moving into agricultural and peri-urban areas, increasing the risk of viral spillovers into horse and human populations [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref028" type="bibr">28</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Nutritional stress may also have impacts on flying-fox physiology and their immune responses in ways that facilitate viral shedding [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref029" type="bibr">29</ref> – <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref031" type="bibr">31</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Flying-foxes are highly mobile animals that may travel hundreds of kilometres to feed on their preferred food–the nectar of flowering eucalyptus trees [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> ].</s>
               <s>As large areas in north-eastern Australia once covered by eucalypt forests have been cleared for agriculture [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref032" type="bibr">32</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref033" type="bibr">33</ref> ], flying-foxes are encroaching upon human settlements in search of anthropogenic food sources such as fruit trees.</s>
               <s>The impacts of climate change on flying-fox behaviours and distribution are predicted to markedly expand the geographic range of HeV risk [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref034" type="bibr">34</ref> ].</s>
               <s>It is increasingly clear that flying-fox ecology drives the epidemiological dynamics of HeV in bat populations and risk of spillover to horses and, consequently, humans [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref031" type="bibr">31</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Increased contact between flying-foxes, domestic animals and human populations in these altered landscapes and disturbed ecosystems exposes the latter to novel pathogens such as HeV, creating the current public health challenge [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref028" type="bibr">28</ref> ].</s>
            </p>
            <p>
               <s>Ecological approaches could usefully complement HeV vaccination and changing horse husbandry practices, such that flying-fox habitat conservation could be an effective public health intervention [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Spectacled and grey-headed flying-fox ( <hi rend="italic">Pteropus poliocephalus</hi> ) species have long been a protected species under state or national legislation, although enforcement was not well resourced or prioritised until the emergence of HeV [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref013" type="bibr">13</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref035" type="bibr">35</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Community-driven and unregulated culling and roost dispersal were the primary modes for managing conflict with flying-fox populations [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref036" type="bibr">36</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Despite the introduction and enforcement of protective legislation, current land management strategies for flying-foxes still focus on removing resources to deter the establishment of roosts near human settlements [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref037" type="bibr">37</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Experience has shown that relocating flying-fox camps is expensive and almost always fails in the longer term [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref011" type="bibr">11</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref038" type="bibr">38</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Rather than solving the problem, dispersal efforts can also lead to the establishment of permanent secondary camps in unexpected and undesirable areas [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref039" type="bibr">39</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Roost dispersal could also increase the risk of HeV transmission within the flying-fox population [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref040" type="bibr">40</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref041" type="bibr">41</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Yet in a recent Queensland-wide survey of community attitudes, some respondents argued for the creation of habitat as a food resource for flying-fox populations as a means to reduce conflict with humans [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref042" type="bibr">42</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Land or habitat sparing and wildlife-friendly farming have been proposed as means to achieve ecological benefits from agricultural landscapes [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref043" type="bibr">43</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Habitat creation and conservation could reduce stress on flying-fox populations, and thereby the risks of zoonotic spillover events [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref040" type="bibr">40</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref044" type="bibr">44</ref> ].</s>
               <s>However, a large proportion of the Australian public considers flying-foxes to be pests [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref042" type="bibr">42</ref> ] and historically the prioritisation of measures that protect them have been met with considerable political resistance, ignored by governments charged with maintaining them, or both [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref013" type="bibr">13</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref036" type="bibr">36</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref045" type="bibr">45</ref> ].</s>
               <s>The adoption of ecological approaches to HeV risks could be highly controversial if they are perceived to place limits on economic development and restrict the rights of landholders [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref046" type="bibr">46</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref047" type="bibr">47</ref> ].</s>

            <p>
               <s>We report on three community juries convened to consider dilemmas raised by increased contact between humans and flying-foxes and the emergence of HeV as a threat to human and equine health.</s>
               <s>Our aim was to elicit the views of well-informed members of the Australian public regarding the acceptability and perceived legitimacy of adding ecological approaches to current interventions that mitigate the risk of HeV spillover.</s>
               <s>Gaining some understanding of the public acceptability (or otherwise) of ecological approaches is important because the adoption of these types of interventions for HeV risks requires substantial reform of land use policy.</s>
               <s>Previous research shows that a lack of consistency and public trust in Australian government planning decision-making have led to anti-government attitudes among many regional landholders [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref048" type="bibr">48</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref049" type="bibr">49</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Moreover, the social response to HeV emergence in Australia has been recruited to promote other policy agendas and political objectives–including protecting agricultural land and asserting the rights of individuals to remove flying-foxes from their property [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref013" type="bibr">13</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Globally and in the Australian context, land management policy is increasingly turning from public regulation to market-based interventions to manage conflicts between environmental conservation and rural livelihood needs [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref047" type="bibr">47</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref048" type="bibr">48</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref050" type="bibr">50</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Even though neither land acquisition nor market-based approaches to habitat creation are being actively considered by policymakers, to mitigate bat-borne zoonotic risks the results of this study can inform nascent discussions about the economic and political feasibility of employing landscape management as a zoonotic disease control and prevention strategy.</s>

                  <s>By providing extensive information from a range of experts, and ensuring conditions for reasonable and extended debate, community juries elicit more considered judgements than other social research methods such as surveys or focus groups.</s>
                  <s>A possible limitation is that the sample size was small, but this is an unavoidable characteristic of community jury methods and is necessary for high-quality deliberation.</s>
                  <s>It is also possible that each jury was comprised of participants who are more interested in issues surrounding flying-fox management than most Australia citizens, by self-selecting during otherwise random recruitment processes.</s>
                  <s>The number of jurors in urban Sydney who own or regularly interact with horses was proportionally smaller than among regional juries, but was consistent with the socio-demographic characteristics of their respective populations.</s>
                  <s>A strength of this study was the quality and reputation of the experts who gave testimony, and the process by which they moderated one another’s presentations until all experts could accept that all views presented could be argued from the evidence.</s>

               <s>Habitat sparing and wildlife-friendly farming have been proposed as measures that could promote ecological benefits for agricultural landscapes [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref043" type="bibr">43</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Researchers working on HeV ecology are beginning to explore the possibility of creating and conserving flying-fox habitat as a public health intervention against current and future zoonotic risks [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref044" type="bibr">44</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Yet policy discussions about how best to manage the threats posed by zoonotic disease tend to focus on managing downstream risks and impacts [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref094" type="bibr">94</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref095" type="bibr">95</ref> ].</s>
               <s>The failure of veterinary and human public health authorities, and wider political systems, to substantively engage with ecological approaches to zoonotic risks is understandable given how recently evidence for their potential efficacy is emerging [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref028" type="bibr">28</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref030" type="bibr">30</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Furthermore, there are challenges in understanding and modifying the complicated social and political structures that drive disease emergence [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref096" type="bibr">96</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref097" type="bibr">97</ref> ].</s>
               <s>Our study shows that, apart from additional knowledge and evidence required for successful adoption of ecological approaches to HeV, they would require significant buy-in from multiple and diverse sets of stakeholders [ <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref027" type="bibr">27</ref> , <ref target="#pone.0209798.ref030" type="bibr">30</ref> ].</s>
               <s>The conceptual foundations and goals of One Health appealed to all three juries, but there were fundamental differences between them, in framing who is responsible for enacting these goals.</s>
               <s>This suggests that any attempt to use landscape management as a public health intervention will need to engage with, and negotiate, longstanding debates about the goals of land management in Australia.</s>
               <s>Recognition that regional populations are not uniform, and that community is as much a site of competition as cooperation, indicates a need to account for the particularities of place in land management and public health strategies.</s>
               <s>Because the effectiveness of ecological approaches to HeV spillovers depends on collective action towards flying-fox habitat creation and conservation across a large geographic area, local differences in HeV risk perception and attitudes to government action would need to be accommodated within the design of the intervention.</s>
