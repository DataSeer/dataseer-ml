            <s>Biofuels policies induce land use changes (LUC), including cropland expansion and crop switching, and this in turn alters water and soil management practices.</s>
            <s>Policies differ in the extent and type of land use changes they induce and therefore in their impact on water resources.</s>
            <s>We quantify and compare the spatially varying water impacts of biofuel crops stemming from LUC induced by two different biofuels policies by coupling a biophysical model with an economic model to simulate the economically viable mix of crops, land uses, and crop management choices under alternative policy scenarios.</s>
            <s>We assess the outputs of an economic model with a high-resolution crop-water model for major agricultural crops and potential cellulosic feedstocks in the US to analyze the impacts of three alternative policy scenarios on water balances: a counterfactual 'no-biofuels policy' (BAU) scenario, a volumetric mandate (Mandate) scenario, and a clean fuel-intensity standard (CFS) scenario incentivizing fuels based on their carbon intensities.</s>
            <s>While both biofuel policies incentivize more biofuels than in the counterfactual, they differ in the mix of corn ethanol and advanced biofuels from miscanthus and switchgrass (more corn ethanol in Mandate and more cellulosic biofuels in CFS).</s>
            <s>The two policies differ in their impact on irrigated acreage, irrigation demand, groundwater use and runoff.</s>
            <s>Net irrigation requirements increase 0.7% in Mandate and decrease 3.8% in CFS, but in both scenarios increases are concentrated in regions of Kansas and Nebraska that rely upon the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation water.</s>
            <s>Our study illustrates the importance of accounting for the overall LUC and shifts in agricultural production and management practices in response to policies when assessing the water impacts of biofuels.</s>

            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There has however been limited assessment of the implications of alternative biofuel policies for water resources.</s>
          <s>As the allocation of water resources is a key concern of natural resource management, particularly in regions where they are scarce, and since changes in land use can directly impact sub-surface water availability for other economic uses, groundwater recharge, and in-stream ecology, it is important to try to understand the implications of different biofuels policies on water availability.</s>
          <s>Biofuel feedstocks differ in the amount and type of water required for their production.</s>
          <s>Food crop based biofuel feedstocks (corn and soybeans) are grown under both rainfed and irrigated conditions in the US while, in accordance with the assumptions in the economic model, energy crops for cellulosic biofuels are expected to be grown under rainfed conditions.</s>
          <s>However, cellulosic energy crops have high evapotranspiration rates; as a result despite their higher water use efficiency compared to corn, they also have high non-irrigation water requirements with potentially adverse impacts on sub-surface water flows.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Various approaches have been suggested in the literature for assessing the water use impacts of biofuel supply chains, including water-use lifecycle assessment (WU-LCA) and water footprint (WF) methods <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>

          <s>WU-LCA studies differ in their approach to characterizing the impacts of biofuel production pathways on water resource quality and availability; some focus on a particular step or portion of the biofuels production pathway while others undertake a full 'wellto-wheels' assessment of all steps of biofuel production and use <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>

          <s>Existing studies using WU-LCA and WF approaches have not incorporated the effects of economically viable changes in land use and land management due to policies promoting biofuels production.</s>
          <s>Since different policy regimes may alter cropping and other land use patterns, attempts to grasp the regional water use impacts of policies should be used to inform policy makers on the natural resource implications of various alternatives.</s>
          <s>Exceptions to this include Housh et al. <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> , which considers the effects of perennial feedstocks in a single watershed in Illinois.</s>
          <s>Vanloocke et al. <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> examines the effects of converting various exogenously given shares of cropland hectares to miscanthus and switchgrass in the Mississippi River Basin without considering the economic incentives needed for that land conversion.</s>

          <s>what would have happened in the absence of biofuels policies?)</s>
          <s>and without consideration of the dynamic interactions between crops production decisions, policy-incentivized land use, management practices and crop choices, the reported biofuel life-cycle water use, or WFs, do not provide sufficient information for making conclusions about potential water impacts of alternative biofuel policies.</s>
          <s>They, therefore, have limited value for policy makers that want to compare the potential impacts of alternative policy regimes and develop effective measures to promote positive and mitigate negative impacts.</s>
          <s>To quantify the spatially varying water impacts of biofuel crops, it is important to couple biophysical models with an economic model to simulate the economically viable, spatially varying mix of crops, land uses, and crop management choices under alternative policy scenarios <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study shows how these shortcomings can be addressed by adopting a scenario-based approach that combines land use outcomes from a U.S.-scale economic model (BEPAM) with a crop-water model (CropWatR) of major crops and biofuel feedstocks.</s>
          <s>The contribution of this study is to analyze water use effects of crop switching and land use change (LUC) of two alternative policy scenarios considered in Chen et al. <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> , a biofuel mandate and a clean fuelintensity standard.</s>
          <s>The policy scenarios modeled in Chen et al. focus on the period 2007-2030.</s>
          <s>The policies analyzed here are stylized versions of the Renewable Fuel Standard and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, extended to a national scale <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These two policies differ in the mix of feedstock production and the spatial pattern of land use changes they induce, and were chosen because they are the main biofuel policies implemented in the US (Mandate) and in states including California and Oregon and had been proposed for the national scale (CFS) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our focus here is to estimate differences in seasonal and annual water flow balances among the crop, soil, and atmosphere between these two alternative policies rather than on analyzing the feasibility and implementability of these policies over the time horizon considered.</s>
          <s>The two policy scenarios analyzed here were developed to achieve the same cumulative GHG reduction targets over this time period.</s>
          <s>By comparing the water impacts of these policies, our analysis shows the different impacts that the same GHG mitigation target can pose on water resource use and availability and the potential to mitigate these impacts through policy choices.</s>

          <s>This scenario is modeled with a target of 150 billion ethanol equivalent liters of biofuel at the end of the modeling period (in 2030) with an upper limit of 56 billion liters of corn ethanol following projections by the Annual Energy Outlook (2010) <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> , and (3) a Clean Fuel-Intensity Standard (CFS) scenario that has features similar to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) implemented in California, Oregon, British Columbia <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> and has been proposed for the US <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38,</ref>

          <s>In general, cellulosic ethanol has lower carbon intensity (gCO 2 e/MJ) compared with corn ethanol, making it more attractive under a CFS policy <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The volumetric mandate (Mandate scenario) is based on projections of the capacity to supply the required quantity of advanced biofuels by 2030 and the projected availability of flex-fuel cars to consume it by the Annual Energy Outlook <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To make the effects of Mandate and CFS comparable, the stringency of the GHG intensity target in CFS is calibrated to achieve the same cumulative reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions as the Mandate scenario by 2030.</s>
          <s>We find that an annual target for lowering GHG intensity of fuel under the CFS that increases linearly to 8% by 2030 achieves the same 4.2% reduction in cumulative domestic GHG emissions by 2030 as the Mandate scenario relative to the no-policy baseline.</s>

          <s>The two cellulosic energy crops included (switchgrass and miscanthus), by virtue of being perennials, have substantially longer growing seasons than row crops (which were historically grown as agricultural commodities, rather than as biofuel feedstocks), such as corn, soy, and wheat, and have similar crop-water use characteristics (and hence, similar influence on hydrology) as uncropped perennial grass land cover (such as grassland pasture or idle cropland).</s>

        <p>
          <s>The patterns associated with Mandate and CFS scenarios can be categorized as one of the following four concerning LUC and related water impacts:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1. Cropland pasture converted to permanent row crops cultivation.</s>
          <s>Transpiration increases in a location are primarily determined by the reference evapotranspiration, the water use intensity of the particular crop, and the length of the growing season.</s>
          <s>Growing season evaporation and off-season evapotranspiration (ET) both decrease proportional to the differences in weed and bare soil ET relative to uncropped perennial land cover in the BAU scenario.</s>
          <s>Groundwater infiltration decreases during the growing season, though this decrease may be somewhat offset by an increase over the off-season.</s>
          <s>Runoff increases in the off-season.</s>
          <s>In the Southern Plains, irrigation water needs are higher (ranging as high as 10%-25% more across large sections of southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas, under both the Mandate and CFS Scenarios), leading to increased irrigation for row crops (since it is assumed that energy crops are rainfed).</s>
          <s>This is the primary LUC type for Mandate scenario.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>2. Land cropped with row crops is displaced by dedicated energy crops.</s>
          <s>Due to the higher growth rates (i.e., high transpiration rates) and longer growing season of energy crops compared with most raw crops, this LUC category leads to an increase in transpiration (typically on the order of 15% to 30%, but in some cases as high as 60% to 80%, depending on the row crop replaced by switchgrass or miscanthus and on climate conditions), and to decreases in all other water flows, including irrigation.</s>
          <s>This occurs primarily in the CFS scenario, wherein about 4% of area cropped in row crops is displaced by energy crops.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>3. Idle cropland and cropland pasture is displaced by energy crops.</s>
          <s>Effects are similar to those in category (2), but the total annual increases in transpiration and decreases in groundwater infiltration may be more muted (although growing season transpiration increases substantially).</s>
          <s>Moreover, runoff in the post-harvest period may increase somewhat (generally by no more than 20%).</s>
          <s>Although the majority of energy crops are planted on marginal lands (77% of total area) in the Mandate scenario, the total area of marginal lands cropped by energy crops is more than four times greater in the CFS scenario (1.69 million hectares).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>4. Land cropped with row crops is taken out of production.</s>
          <s>This category of LUC is atypical (accounting for only 2% and 6% of the total cropped land in Mandate and CFS, respectively), but does occur.</s>
          <s>The water use impacts are opposite to those of category 1, and irrigation requirements are reduced.</s>

        <head>Comparison of water use across alternative policy scenarios</head>
        <p>
          <s>The land use and total water balances across all modeled crops in the base year ( show those localities with more pronounced (ranging from ±10% to as high as ±50% in isolated regions, and even greater changes in the case of adoption or cessation of irrigation) decreases (green) and increases (red) in a few grid cells.</s>
          <s>These are regions where more pronounced impacts of biofuel policies on water resource availability and hydrologic processes are more likely to occur.</s>
          <s>The broad white areas correspond to regions with a clear pattern (i.e., increased or decreased water flows) but very low intensity (with changes to water balances of less than 3.5% on average), i.e. areal extent is broad, but impact per hectare is small.</s>
          <s>The grey areas correspond to regions of the country where water balances are essentially unchanged (i.e.</s>
          <s>where changes are less than the first percentile of average grid-level water balance changes).</s>
          <s>Of these four categories discussed in Section 3.1, the most pronounced water use impacts (with changes in water flows on the order of ±10% to ±50%) are of type (1), i.e. in those regions where cropland pasture is converted to row crops.</s>
          <s>Corresponding to LUC categories (2) and (3), the signal of increased transpiration counterbalanced by decreased groundwater infiltration and irrigation across the eastern states is also evident in CFS scenario.</s>
          <s>Results can be usefully described at the broadest level of hydrologic classification used by the United States Geological Survey, by Water Resource Regions (WRRs), which divide the contiguous United States into 18 regions, following drainage areas of major rivers.</s>
          <s>Within any given WRR, water flow changes will be positive for some grid cells, and negative for others.</s>
          <s>The positive and negative water flow changes may counterbalance one another at the WRR level; for instance, in Ohio WRR under Mandate, positive and negative changes in crop-water flows approximately counterbalance each other, muting the net signal that a shift occurs from evapotranspiration to economically productive transpiration.</s>

          <s>Even though overall effects are relatively small, the effects differ for different sources of water and different regions.</s>
          <s>Net irrigation requirements increase 0.7% in Mandate and decrease 3.8% in CFS, but in both scenarios increases are concentrated in regions of Kansas and Nebraska that rely upon the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation water.</s>
          <s>A net increase in transpiration (0.3% vs. 5.6% in Mandate and CFS respectively) and a commensurate net decrease in groundwater infiltration (-0.5% vs. -5.1% in Mandate and CFS respectively) and annual evaporation and off-season transpiration (~1% in both scenarios) are observed in both Mandate and CFS.</s>
          <s>The regions where transpiration increases most are those that have the largest increases in cropped area-Wisconsin, Illinois, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and east of the mid stretches of the Mississippi in Mandate, and stretches along much of the eastern US, but most extreme in the Great Plains, from Texas north to North Dakota, and along the mid-stretches of the Mississippi, in CFS.</s>
          <s>These pronounced increases in cropped area under CFS are a combination of direct cultivation of energy crops on prime cropland and of crop displacement-as prime cropland in eastern states is converted to energy crops, row crops are instead grown in the states listed above (as well as in the Midwest and Corn Belt).</s>

          <s>Both Mandate and CFS shift irrigation patterns to the Western Corn Belt and the Southern Great Plains.</s>
          <s>Cropped land area increases by 2% and 6% under Mandate and CFS scenarios, respectively.</s>
          <s>Though there is a net decrease in the acreage of irrigated cropland of 2% in Mandate and 0.3% in CFS scenario, net irrigation water increases by 0.7% in Mandate scenario, and decreases by 3.8% under CFS, compared to BAU.</s>
          <s>Both Mandate and CFS result in lower irrigation in certain regions by incentivizing rainfed feedstock cultivation that displaces irrigated row crops, and they lead to more cultivated area in arid Great Plains (including Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, the panhandle of Texas, and North and South Dakota) due to an overall increase in corn acreage under Mandate and displacement of cropping of corn, soy, and other crops under CFS. 2. By increasing total cropped land area, Mandate and CFS also lead to a net increase in ET with concomitant reductions in groundwater infiltration recharging surface and potentially also groundwater stocks over agricultural lands throughout the West, Midwest, Corn Belt, and the rest of the Eastern United States.</s>
          <s>Increases in ET are more pronounced in the CFS scenario, which are mostly offset by greater reductions in groundwater infiltration than in Mandate (see <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>3. Increased runoff in regions where formerly uncropped land is converted to row crop and energy crop cultivation, for instance along states in the Lower Mississippi WRR.</s>
          <s>Thus, extensive cropping of corn and possibly energy crops may also lead to greater runoff in regions of the Ohio and Upper and Lower Mississippi WRRs.</s>
          <s>While the magnitude of this effect is similar in the CFS and Mandate scenarios in some regions, it is more pronounced in the Mandate scenario in northeastern Kansas and Southwestern Nebraska (as a result of increased corn planting), whereas the spatial extent of runoff increases in the CFS is far wider, particularly in the Lower Mississippi WRR.</s>

        <figDesc>Fig 3 shows net water flow changes summed separately within each of the WRRs in Mandate and CFS scenarios, respectively, relative to the BAU. In CFS, diminished irrigation requirements throughout most of the eastern U.S. result from the displacement of row crops by bioenergy crops. Increased irrigation requirements in the Missouri WRR occur due to partial displacement of these same row crops to Nebraska, Kansas, and other states. Results also suggest reduced irrigation (though of smaller magnitudes compared with CFS) across the Eastern U.S. in Mandate, but with significant increases in Missouri and other WRRs west of the Mississippi river. As can be seen from Fig 3, the general pattern of changes in crop water use are: (1) an increase in transpiration nationwide and in most regions, particularly under CFS scenario, and a commensurate decrease in evaporation and post-harvesting season transpiration; (2) slightly decreased irrigation water use east of the Mississippi-which is a result of displacement and substitution of row crops by energy crops, (3) regions of substantial increase in irrigation water requirements in the Great Plains from Texas to Nebraska, and (4) runoff increases in regions under the most extreme extensification-in Kansas and Oklahoma under Mandate and in Texas and the lower Mississippi under CFS. A net increase in transpiration (0.3% vs. 5.6% in Mandate and CFS respectively) and a commensurate net decrease in groundwater infiltration (-0.5% vs. -5.1% in Mandate and CFS respectively) and annual evaporation and off-season transpiration (~1% in both scenarios) are observed in both Mandate and CFS. The regions where transpiration increases most are those that have the largest increases in cropped area-Wisconsin, Illinois, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and east of the mid stretches of the Mississippi in Mandate, and stretches along much of the eastern US, but most extreme in the Great Plains, from Texas north to North Dakota, and along the mid-stretches of the Mississippi, in CFS. These pronounced increases in cropped area under CFS are a combination of direct cultivation of energy crops on prime cropland and of crop displacement-as prime cropland in eastern states is converted to energy crops, row crops are instead grown in the states listed above (as well as in the Midwest and Corn Belt).</figDesc>

Fig 4 shows the green-and blue WFs of corn and soybean in the base year (2008), and in each of the scenario for these two main agricultural feedstocks plus Miscanthus and switchgrass. Vari- ability in WF is primarily a function of geography. The lower WFs of corn grain ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel in BAU compared to the base year is due to yield increases assumed in BEPAM, which lead by the final year (2030) to increased productivity per unit area of these crops by 29% and 12%, WFs of corn grain ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel in 2030 in the BAU is smaller compared to the base year (2008). The national area-weighted average green and blue WFs for corn cultivation in the base year were 18.3 L/MJ of ethanol (with a 5%-95% range from 12.0-49.2 L/MJ) and 10.2 L/MJ (5%-95% range from 5.0-30.9 L/MJ), respectively.

A range of methods are available for determining evapotranspiration at the field, landscape, and water- shed scales, either via direct measurement (e.g. soil moisture measurement via lysimeters), modeling (e.g. via process-based s imulation models, or energy balances using weather data collected via satellite, local instruments, and/or remote sensing). For a summary of common methods, see Connor et al.,2011. Table C. Model performance metrics comparing the results with MODIS 16 estimates. Table E. NASS Classification categories considered in this anal- ysis. Note that double-cropped classifications where both crops were not included among the 14 parameterized crops (e.g. lettuce / upland cotton, lettuce / barley, etc.) were excluded from the analysis. The total acreage of these classifications on the national scale was in all cases much less than 1% of the acreage of the modeled crop. Table F. NASS Accuracy assessments for crops and land types considered in this analysis. Accuracy statistics for crop and land use categories not reported in the above table are not available for 2008. These categories are: alfalfa, other hay, sugarcane, fallow/idle cropland, grassland herbaceous, and pasture/hay.</figDesc>
