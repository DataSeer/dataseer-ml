          <s>The N 2 was added to the mixture to verify successful capture of COS on Tenax when diluted by the main component of the atmosphere.</s>

          <s>Note that both N 2 and O 2 do not spontaneously react with COS, nor will it react with the Tenax at this temperature.</s>
          <s>Other gases are not expected to interfere in COS trapping on Tenax because they are in trace amounts in the atmosphere, and even if captured by the Tenax, they will be separated by the GC column.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Our COS standards analysis showed that the method we used is highly useful and applicable for measurements of COS δ 34 S values at atmospheric concentrations.</s>
          <s>There were no apparent effects of the pre-concentration step on the precision and accuracy, and no interfering effects from other gases in the gas matrix used (either He or N 2 and CO 2 ).</s>
          <s>These results provide confidence that the measurements of natural air samples represent reliably the atmospheric COS δ 34 S values.</s>
          <s>The natural air samples showed an average δ 34 S value of 13.2 ± 0.6‰, with no detectable variation in isotopic composition between the Canary Islands and Israel, despite a very different trajectory of the air before arriving to the sampling locations.</s>
          <s>A back-trajectory analysis by NOAA's HYSPLIT <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> shows that the history of the air sampled in the Canary Islands was mostly of a path along the north Atlantic, which only slightly brushed against the western edge of Europe (mostly Portugal), before continuing over the Atlantic to the sampling point.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the air sampled in Israel had a much more continental path <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The similar values for Israel and the Canary Islands are probably the result of the long life time of COS in the atmosphere, which is a few years 1 .</s>
          <s>Hence, this similarity seems to indicate that the δ 34 S value we measured represents the clean atmosphere.</s>
          <s>The only previously published measurement of atmospheric COS <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> reported a measurement of a single sample with δ 34 S value of 4.9 ± 0.3‰.</s>
          <s>This value is much lighter from an estimated <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> value of 11‰, and from the value we measured (13.2 ± 0.6‰) in two independent locations.</s>
          <s>This mismatch may stem from the fact that Hattori et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> single δ 34 S value was measured from compressed air that was collected at the manufacturer's factory in Kawasaki, Japan, and might not represent the clean atmosphere COS signal.</s>
          <s>It might also result from the markedly different methods used in the two studies.</s>
          <s>More specifically, the need to pre-concentrate hundreds of liters of air in Hattori et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> as well as the analysis on fragments ions may introduce additional sources of error.</s>
          <s>However, although it seems unlikely, we cannot rule out at this stage the possibility that the δ 34 S value of COS is not homogenous globally and so there are real and significant difference between the δ 34 S values between Japan and Israel/Canary Islands.</s>
          <s>Further δ 34 S analyses of COS from around the world are needed to confirm that.</s>
          <s>Assuming that the atmosphere is well mixed (homogenous) in regards to COS, and using our clean air atmospheric COS δ 34 S value (i.e.</s>
          <s>13.2 ± 0.6‰) to represent it, there are several important implications that can be drawn in relation to the contribution of COS to background aerosols and to the relative sources of COS to the atmosphere.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>COS is suggested to be an important source of sulfur to the stratosphere background aerosols <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on the range of expected fractionation for COS oxidation at the tropopause and the stratosphere (ε x = −8‰ to −2.3‰ <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22 )</ref> , and the atmospheric δ 34 S value we measured, the COS oxidation products (which end up as stratospheric aerosols) are expected to have an isotopic value of 4.9-10.6‰</s>
          <s>(δ <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34</ref> S products = δ 34 S COS + ε x ).</s>
          <s>Given the measured δ 34 S of stratospheric background aerosols 23 of 2.6‰, our COS isotopic measurements are consistent with COS being an important, but not the single, source for these aerosols.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is also possible to constrain the relative contribution of the ocean and anthropogenic COS sources, by a simple 1-box isotopic balance model as illustrated in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> .</s>
          <s>For this model we use the following initial assumptions regarding the isotopic signatures of COS sources and sinks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Ocean source: We assume here that the isotopic composition of COS emitted from the ocean is ~19‰, with negligible fractionation during degassing, similar to the values recently found for another oceanic trace sulfur compound -DMS <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>This assumption is feasible since both COS and DMS are degradation products of organic sulfur.</s>
          <s>Organic sulfur of marine microorganisms is produced by microbial assimilatory sulfate reduction process from seawater sulfate (+21.1‰) with a small (&lt;3‰) fractionation <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> , similar to that found for DMSP/DMS <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, part of the oceanic flux of the COS is the result of oxidation of DMS to COS <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref>
