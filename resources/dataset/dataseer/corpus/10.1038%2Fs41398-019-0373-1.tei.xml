            <s>One downstream effect of early-life adversity is the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent gene networks that drive acute and long-term adaptive behavioral and cellular responses to stress.</s>
            <s>We have previously shown that genetic variants that moderate GR-induced gene transcription (GR-response eSNPs) are significantly enriched among risk variants from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for MDD and SCZ.</s>
            <s>Here, we show that the 63 transcripts regulated by these disease-associated functional genetic variants form a tight glucocorticoid-responsive co-expression network (termed GCN).</s>
            <s>We hypothesized that changes in the correlation structure of this GCN may contribute to earlylife adversity-associated disease risk.</s>
            <s>Therefore, we analyzed the effects of different qualities of social support and stress throughout life on GCN formation across distinct brain regions using a translational mouse model.</s>
            <s>We observed that different qualities of social experience substantially affect GCN structure in a highly brain region-specific manner.</s>
            <s>GCN changes were predominantly found in two functionally interconnected regions, the ventral hippocampus and the hypothalamus, two brain regions previously shown to be of relevance for the stress response, as well as psychiatric disorders.</s>
            <s>Overall, our results support the hypothesis that a subset of genetic variants may contribute to risk for MDD and SCZ by altering circuit-level effects of early and adult social experiences on GCN formation and structure.</s>

          <s>Importantly though, the impact of early-life adversity on disease risk is moderated by genetic variation <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> and later life experiences through biological mechanisms, which are insufficiently understood at present.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Adverse early experiences typically activate the stress hormone system leading to increased glucocorticoid secretion and the activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) by cortisol <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>GRs reside in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus upon cortisol binding to regulate gene expression through sequence-specific DNA binding or protein interactions with other DNA-bound transcriptional regulators 7 .</s>
          <s>GR-regulated gene networks coordinate acute and long-term adaptive responses to stress, as well as timely termination of the stress response once the threat has been mastered.</s>
          <s>Failure to turn-on and -off GR responses efficiently has been proposed to result in "wear and tear" of the body and the brain and facilitates the development of associated pathologies <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Studies on the genetics of gene expression provide a unique opportunity to link DNA sequence variation to phenotypes and disease <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>We previously hypothesized that genetic variation in GR-regulated gene networks could contribute to the risk for psychiatric diseases <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s cert="0.9033781886100769" id="dataset-1" type="Tabular data">Therefore, we measured glucocorticoid-induced changes in gene expression in genetically diverse individuals to infer GR expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).</s>
          <s>Genetic variants significantly associated with differential GR-induced expression preferentially mapped to long-range enhancer elements consistent with GR's major mode of transcriptional regulation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, these GR-response eQTLs were significantly enriched in brain-specific enhancers and among genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for MDD and SCZ <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>In additional independent samples, these variants also predicted major depression and amygdala (AMY) reactivity to threat in a cumulative manner.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Focusing on MDD risk genes in our initial analyses, we showed that the transcripts moderated by these variants are expressed in the brain, are regulated by stress, and form a tight co-expression network that comprised basic biological processes such as ubiquitination, proteasome degradation, and inflammation.</s>
          <s>We hypothesized that the cumulative genetic scores for these functional disease variants could change the response of the whole coexpression network to different qualities of social experience and by this influence disease risk.</s>
          <s>A first step towards testing this hypothesis would be to assess whether indeed exposure to different qualities of social experience can alter the co-expression network structure of these transcripts.</s>
          <s>This can be tested in animal models exposed to different qualities of social support and stress throughout development and beyond for which the expression levels of the transcripts within these gene networks is measured in different brain regions.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The main intent of our experiment was to explore the dynamics of this glucocorticoid-responsive co-expression network (GCN) (capturing the information from GWAS risk variants) in response to extreme differences in social experiences during early and or adult life, modeling epidemiological risk and protective factors for MDD/SCZ.</s>
          <s>We have chosen an animal model that contrasts different qualities of social support and stress during different developmental stages to explicitly capture the complexity of social life trajectories 12 .</s>

          <s>Briefly, Enrichr implements three approaches to compute an enrichment: (1) Fisher's exact test, (2) permutation-based Fisher's exact test (generates multiple random gene lists and computes a z-score for deviation from the expected rank), and (3) a combined test ((p-value of 1) × (z-score of 2)).</s>

          <s>We detected major differences in network strength dependent both on the previous stress history and the specific brain region.</s>
          <s>Mainly, in the PVN, a central driver of the stress response, we observed a strong (number of nodes n = 30 vs. mean = 5.9), wellstructured (number of edges n = 38 vs. mean = 5.3), and dense (link density n = 2.53 vs. mean = 0.8) GCN in the absence of any stress history (EHOX).</s>
          <s>The co-expression network in this brain region was completely absent in mice exposed to both, early and late social stress (LMCD, all measures = 0) and to a lesser degree in mice exposed to early adversity only (LMOX, nodes n = 17 vs.</s>
          <s>mean = 6.7, edges n = 15 vs. mean = 4.6, link density n = 1.76 vs. mean = 0.8).</s>

          <s>mean = 6.6, edges n = 40 vs. mean = 8.6, link density n = 2.96 vs. mean = 0.9) did not alter paraventricular network formation when compared with stress-free mice (EHOX).</s>
          <s>This suggests stronger effects of early adversity on the GCN in PVN than adult chronic stress, as well as a cumulative effect of stress exposure on the strength of this network.</s>
          <s>The brain region with the second largest dynamic network changes across the four conditions was the vCA1.</s>
          <s>In contrast to the PVN, the vCA1 region, sharing a major role in stress regulation 32 did not express the GCN (all network parameters 0) in the absence of any stress history (EHOX), but GCN network strength emerged with exposure to adult stress (EHCD, nodes n = 14, edges n = 8, link density n = 1.14) and was further strengthened by combined exposure to early and adults stress (LMCD, nodes n = 30, edges n = 31, link density n = 2.07).</s>

        <p>
          <s>However, exposure to early-life adversity alone (LMOX) was not associated with network formation.</s>

        <p>
          <s>It is important to note that changes in GCN formation were not confined to the PVN and hippocampal vCA1 region, but observed also in other brain regions although to a much lower degree (see <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> ).</s>

          <s>Brain region-specific social environment-responsivity raises the question whether the network properties of the underlying risk genes are preserved across brain regions and conditions.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we next investigated the number of edges per GCN gene in the PVN and the vCA1 in those conditions exhibiting GCN formation (PVN: EHOX, EHCD, LMOX and vCA1: EHCD, LMCD), and also included data from the dCA1 (EHOX, EHCD, LMCD), the third most connected region (although with quite a distance (see <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> )) for comparison.</s>
          <s>Hierarchical clustering analysis (see <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3d</ref> ) revealed that the two GCNs in the PVN under the low early stress conditions cluster closely together, suggesting that adult chronic stress does not strongly impact the edge structure of the PVN network (i.e., similar connectedness of the network genes), whereas it is disrupted with early stress exposure.</s>
          <s>A different picture emerged in the vCA1, were the two conditions with the highest overall connectedness of the GCN (EHCD and LMCD) showed dissimilar edge properties and were not the next neighbors in the clustering analysis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We then explored the exact topology of the stressdependent GCNs in the PVN and the vCA1 (see <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We first noted that both, MDD and SCZ-associated transcripts contributed proportionally (38% MDD genes in original selection, range of MDD genes in networks 29-35%) to each of the networks, indicating the absence of disease-specific involvement in any of the regulated GCN networks.</s>
          <s>When focusing on the PVN, we noted that the network under conditions of social support (EHOX) contained 30 of the 50 orthologue transcripts and that eight of the network genes had more than four connections.</s>
          <s>In the adult stress only condition (EHCD), a network of similar strength was observed (27 transcripts) sharing more than half (n = 16) transcripts with the EHOX network.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, six of the eight genes with more than four connections in the EHOX network were also included in the EHCD network, namely Slc7a7, Rbm4, Zap70, St6galnac4, Zfp641, and Ociad2 and the majority of them (n = 4), again had four or more connections.</s>
          <s>This suggests that while these two PVN networks are not identical, they share a number of key features, supporting that adult stress also does not have a major impact on the network topology.</s>
          <s>However, one has to note that the centrality and connectivity pattern of some transcripts were affected by the additional stress condition.</s>
          <s>For example, Psd5a with two edges in the EHOX condition, moved to a more central position in the EHCD condition, with nine edges.</s>
          <s>As described above, this paraventricular co-expression network is disrupted with exposure to early adversity, especially when followed by adult chronic stress.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Contrary to the PVN, the vCA1 GCN was mainly apparent in the combined stress condition (LMCD).</s>
          <s>Here 30 of the 50 transcripts formed a correlated expression network, with 16 genes shared with low stress PVN network (EHOX) and an additional six, which were only present in the adult only stress (EHLM) PVN network.</s>
          <s>Of the eight more highly connected genes in the PVN EHOX condition, four were also included in the vCA1 LMCD network, however, only two of them still showed a high connectivity (Ociad2 and Zfp641).</s>
          <s>This suggests that while a substantial number of transcripts are shared between the low early stress PVN network and the combined stress vCA1 network, the topology of this network differed more than between the two PVN networks.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, Psd5-the most connected gene in the PVN adult stress network (eight edges) was also part of the vCA1 combined stress network and showed four connections, suggesting that connectivity of this gene may more specifically relate to chronic adult stress.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this article, we report that 63 transcripts for which GR-induced gene expression was modulated by MDD/ SCZ-associated SNPs form a tightly interconnected gene expression network (GCN).</s>
          <s>This raises the question whether this GCN could respond to differences in social experiences, especially early-life stress, an important risk factor for MDD and SCZ.</s>
          <s>When analyzing the effects of different qualities of social stress in contrast to different qualities of social support on GCN formation across distinct brain regions during distinct developmental phases in mice, we observed that these different social experiences substantially affect GCN formation and structure.</s>
          <s>These changes were highly brain region-specific and apparent mainly in two functionally interconnected regions, the ventral hippocampus and the hypothalamus (see below).</s>
          <s>The fact that the transcripts within this network are highly regulated across human hippocampal development suggests a role in neuronal development and their developmental trajectory may serve as a substrate for early-life experiences to influence differential GCN formation.</s>

        <p>
          <s>When annotating the 58 transcripts connected within this GCN, we found enrichment of the GO cellular components "late endosome membrane" and "multivesicular membrane", both contributing to endocytosis.</s>
          <s>Regulation of endosomal traffic is a critical component of synaptic growth and development.</s>
          <s>Many of the synaptic growth mutants identified in Drosophila alter endocytic trafficking: mutations disrupting the formation of signaling endosomes cause reduced synaptic growth, while mutations altering traffic to the recycling endosome or lysosome cause synaptic overgrowth due to enhanced signaling <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>Endosomal regulation of signaling pathways in synaptic growth and development appears critical for activity-dependent circuit refinement and are proposed to contribute to risk for MDD and SCZ <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>In support of this hypothesis, postmortem brain studies showed these pathways to be altered in both SCZ and MDD <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36</ref> .</s>
          <s>This suggests that alterations in stress-induced changes of endocytosis could contribute to disease risk by altering neuronal activity.</s>
          <s>For example, glutamate receptor turnover has been shown to be altered by glucocorticoidinduced enhancement of ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of receptor subunits 37 , a process localized to late endosomes and multivesicular membranes <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38,</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The second enriched pathway was inflammation, a system not only strongly implicated in both disorders by a large body of experimental evidence <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">42,</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43</ref> but also from recent cross-disorder annotations of GWASs including both disorders <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">44</ref> .</s>

          <s>These include Snrnp70, Rps2, Rps12, Mrpl54, Rbm4 for ribosomal processes; Zap70 and Rfx5 for immune-related functions, and Anx2 for endocytosis <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> , suggesting the experience-specific co-regulation of these pathways.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, transcripts with eSNPs associated with either MDD or SCZ contributed to a similar degree to these dynamically regulated networks in the animal model.</s>
          <s>This suggests that genes associated with either disorder may impact networks sensitive to different qualities of social experiences.</s>
          <s>For the development of human pathology, it raises the question whether one would observe diseasespecific changes in GCN with exposure to adversity.</s>
          <s>One possibility could be that disease-specific genetic variation would impact distinct hubs in the same network leading to similar GCN alterations.</s>
          <s>For example, in the network emerging with combined stress in the ventral hippocampus, the four "hub" transcripts are influenced by both SCZ-associated variants (PSD5 and ZFP641) and MDDassociated variants (OCIAD2 and ATP5F1) (see <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, additional experiments in human tissue are necessary to test this hypothesis.</s>

          <s>By comparing GCNs in the combined support vs. the combined stress condition, we observed opposite GCN formation within the vCA1 region and the PVN, with other regions showing little or no co-expression structure (see Figs. 3a-c).</s>
          <s>These two functionally highly interconnected regions are critical for a well-organized stress response and stress-related psychiatric disorders <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, intercorrelated changes in GCN formation could reflect changes in region-specific molecular signatures that evolve in response to social experiences and additionally integrate reciprocal feedback mechanisms between interdependent domains.</s>
          <s>While we can conclude that different qualities of social experiences alter GCN formation and structure in a brain region specific, and possibly functionally interdependent manner, we cannot as easily extrapolate whether these processes associate with risk or resilience to stress-related phenotypes.</s>
          <s>In any case, our results are compatible with the hypothesis that MDD and SCZ manifest circuit-level disorders in which several functionally interconnected brain regions are affected <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46,</ref>

          <s>The same group had previously reported differential changes of co-expression networks and changes in network strength, suggesting that changes in co-expression strength has the potential to impact cellular function in animals susceptible or resilient to this stress paradigm in a coordinated manner across brain regions, including the ventral hippocampus <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">50</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, among the 30 genes constituting the network emerging in the ventral CA1 in the combined early and late stress group in our experiments, five genes (Lnc2, Impdh2, Anxa2, Rps2, and Psmb3) also showed significant changes in gene expression in the ventral hippocampus between resilient and susceptible animals and control animals.</s>
