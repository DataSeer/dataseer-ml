          <s>Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is an aggressive myeloid malignancy currently listed under the World Health Organization (WHO) category of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> .</s>
          <s>PMF represents a stem cell-derived clonal expansion of myeloid cells that often harbor one of three driver mutations, including JAK2, CALR and MPL.</s>
          <s>PMF is morphologically characterized by abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation that is often accompanied by reticulin fibrosis.</s>
          <s>Patients with PMF typically display severe anemia, marked hepatosplenomegaly and profound constitutional symptoms.</s>
          <s>Other complications of the disease include cachexia, thrombosis, bleeding and leukemic transformation (LT).</s>
          <s>Overall survival (OS) in PMF is estimated at 6 years and can range between a few months to over 20 years, depending on the presence or absence of specific clinical and genetic risk factors <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Current treatment in PMF includes allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), which is the only treatment modality with the potential to cure the disease or prolong survival <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other treatment approaches in PMF are mostly palliative and include drug therapy (e.g.</s>
          <s>JAK2 inhibitors), splenectomy and involved field radiation therapy <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Taking the above into consideration, the primary objective in developing a treatment strategy for the individual patient with PMF is to establish the timing of allo-SCT.</s>
          <s>The particular task is often accomplished by considering risk level, according to previously established risk models for OS.</s>
          <s>At present, these include the geneticallyinspired prognostic scoring system (GIPSS) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> and the mutation-and karyotype-enhanced prognostic scoring system (MIPSS70 + version 2.0) <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> .</s>
          <s>GIPSS relies on genetic risk factors only, including karyotype, driver mutations and other mutations, including ASXL1, SRSF2 and U2AF1 Q157.</s>
          <s>MIPSS70 + version 2.0 utilizes the same genetic risk factors used in GIPSS but also incorporates three specific clinical risk factors, including constitutional symptoms, presence of severe/moderate anemia and ≥ 2% circulating blasts.</s>
          <s>The main objective for the current study was to develop a robust LT predictive model that complements GIPSS and MIPSS70 + version 2.0 and thus further facilitates treatment decision-making in PMF; in this regard, it is to be recalled that, in the context of GIPSS/MIPSS70 + , leukemia-free survival (LFS) was previously shown to be affected by karyotype, SRSF2 and ASXL1 mutations, platelet count &lt; 100 × 10 9 /l and circulating blasts ≥ 2% 3,7 .</s>

          <s>More recent information suggests that patients with triple-negative driver mutational status 2 and those who harbor ASXL1, SRSF2, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations 14 were also at increased risk of LT.</s>

          <s>The current study provides a highly discriminating LT predictive model for PMF, which was shown to be superior to both GIPSS and MIPSS70 + version 2.0 in its LT predictive accuracy <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, it should be noted that almost all of the variables used in the new LT predictive model (i.e., IDH1, ASXL1, SRSF2 mutations, circulating blasts ≥ 3%, age &gt; 70 years and moderate/ severe anemia) were previously associated with shortened LFS (see above).</s>
          <s>What is different in the current study was i) the much larger sample size of informative cases; ii) the distinction between early events (logistic analysis of LT risk in the first 5 years of diagnosis) and overall risk (assessed by Cox analysis of LFS); iii) the combined analysis of mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical variables, in order to decipher inter-independent risk factors; and iv) development of a novel LT predictive model that includes both genetic and clinical risk factors.</s>
          <s>From a practical standpoint, the new LT risk model for PMF complements GIPSS and MIPSS70 + version 2.0 and should provide additional layer of prognostic information to assist with treatment decision-making, especially in terms of patient selection for allo-SCT.</s>
          <s>The current study also confirms the prognostic importance of specific mutations, sex-adjusted anemia and excess circulating blasts, for both OS and LFS, in PMF.</s>
          <s>Our observations require further validation, which might not be easy to accomplish, considering the difficulty in securing adequate number of informative cases.</s>
