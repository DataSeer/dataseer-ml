        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The antiviral drugs, provided within a EAP, allowed the clinicians to treat a large number of patients with advanced liver disease at high risk of decompensation and mortality and to collect data on efficacy and safety of the different regimens containing DCV on difficult to treat population that is often excluded from clinical trials.</s>
          <s>SVR rate observed in our cohort was 87.3% with SVR12 higher than 90% in patient treated with SOF and DCV also in the subgroups more difficult to cure, such as decompensated cirrhosis, genotype 1a or 3 and/or HIV co-infection.</s>

          <s>Indeed, in our study, cirrhotic patients treated with combination of DCV and SIM or ASU achieved SVR12 in less than 70% of cases and also the lower SVR rate observed in genotype 4 patients can be related to the high percentage of patients treated with DCV combined with protease inhibitors in this subgroup.</s>
          <s>This is the first real life study that compared in a consistent number of patients (221 treated with DCV/SOF and 54 treated with DCV/SIM or ASU) the efficacy of different DCV-based regimens in patients with cirrhosis and/or HIV coinfection.</s>
          <s>In fact, previously, only Fontana et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> compared, in a cohort of post-transplanted HCV patients, the combination of DCV/SOF and DCV/PI and similarly to our results they demonstrated a SVR rates of 91% and 72% in patients treated with DCV/SOF and DCV/SIM respectively.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Ishigami et al. <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> have reported that patients with advanced fibrosis presented a lower rate of SVR achieving only 90% of SVR compared to 95% of patients with mild liver disease.</s>
          <s>However, in this study severe fibrosis was defined with a value of FIB 4 index &gt; 3.25 and not decompensated liver patients were enrolled in this study,</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>According to the results of other community based expanded access programs 17 with similar high proportion of patients with Child-Pugh B, we have confirmed the high SVR rates obtained by the combination of DCV/SOF regardless the use of RBV, the HIV coinfection and the transplant condition.</s>
          <s>HCV genotype was associated with SVR at univariate analysis with significant difference of SVR rate between genotype 1a, 1b and 3 versus genotype 4. The highest rate of SVR12 was observed among 40 genotype 3 patients (92.5%) followed by the 72 genotype 1a patients (91.7%).</s>
          <s>All of these patients received the combination of DCV/SOF associated in an higher percentage of cases with RBV.</s>
          <s>Conversely, the lowest SVR rate was observed among genotype 4 patients (69.2%) who received DCV associated with PI in 50% of cases.</s>
          <s>In order to better understand the reasons of suboptimal efficacy of DCV based regimens in genotype 4 patients it is worth taking into account also the results of Fourati et al. <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> which, in a French cohort, have recently recorded an high rate of virological failure DAA-treated patients infected with genotype 4.</s>
          <s>Moreover, they have identified that the subtype 4r was significantly related with treatment failure due to the higher prevalence of S282C/T RASs development.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Together with the DCV regimen, also bilirubin value was independently associated with a lower response to antiviral therapy.</s>
          <s>This is consistent with previous studies which showed lower SVR12 rates in patients with advanced liver disease 12,16 whose bilirubin is an indicator.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In order to assess the impact of SVR on the liver function of patients with advanced and decompensated liver disease we have evaluated biochemical changes between baseline and follow up in our cohort of patients.</s>
          <s>Results revealed a significant improvement of albumin and bilirubin values from baseline to follow-up week 12, along with a not significant decrease in mean MELD score.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study has several limitations: retrospective study, no randomization of treatment allocation and the of use of RBV (used at physicians' discretion), laboratory tests were conducted using the devices available at each centre and therefore, assay differences may have caused inconsistencies in laboratory-based efficacy and safety assessments.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, as a common limitation of real-life cohorts, the adverse events might be under-reported.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In spite of these limitations, this study reports data about a large cohort of patients with advanced liver disease treated with an oral DAA combination in a real-life setting.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, data collected in this EAP demonstrated that DCV + SOF, with or without RBV in patients with advanced cirrhosis in a real-world setting is very effective, also for more "difficult to cure" HCV genotypes.</s>
          <s>The combination of DCV with prothease inhibitors (ASU/SIM confirmed its suboptimal efficacy and should be avoided in advanced liver disease.</s>
          <s>Treatment was well tolerated and was associated with improvements in liver function tests.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A longer follow-up period will allow the monitoring of clinical changes in these patients and will provide further insight into the long-term benefits of achieving SVR in patients with advanced liver disease.</s>
