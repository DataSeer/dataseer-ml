        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Multispectral imaging (MSI) techniques are a set of broadband photographic methods specifically adapted to map the photoluminescence and reflective characteristics of surfaces under different wavelengths of light.</s>
          <s>When conducted using standardised acquisition and post-processing methods, information about the chemical nature of the materials present and their spatial distribution can be obtained.</s>
          <s>This can also provide guidance in planning more targeted and effective sampling strategies and facilitate comparisons between objects <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although the use of MSI techniques is well-established in the study of polychrome surfaces <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , these have only been used sparingly in the investigation of historical or archaeological textiles.</s>
          <s>Coremans' use of near infrared (NIR) photography in 1938, to document tapestry restorations <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , was an early adoption of employing wavelengths of light outside of the capabilities of the human eye in the investigation of textiles.</s>
          <s>However, only recently have more scientific applications appeared in the literature.</s>
          <s>Of these, Borrego and Vega's use of multispectral techniques, particularly ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence (UVL) to differentiate between linen and wool fibres in Late Antique textiles from the Soler Vilabella collection at the Museum of Monserrat (Barcelona, Spain), is of note <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The use of multispectral techniques, such as UVL and infrared-reflected (IRR) imaging were also effectively employed by <ref type="bibr">Haldane et al.</ref> to document stains on a Late Antique Egyptian tunic from the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite these important applications in both the differentiation of materials and the documentation of textiles (interestingly both on Late Antique textile collections) little has been done <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> specifically on the use of these techniques to investigate the photoluminescence and reflective properties of the dyes and colourants.</s>
          <s>Often faded, the (once) highly-coloured appearance of many historic or archaeological textiles is a defining aspect and imperative to understanding their provenance, their interpretation and their placement in a socio-economic context.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Fewer attempts still <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> have been made to consider a systematic approach towards both the acquisition and post-processing of these images or to establish protocols to ensure that problems of reproducibility and comparability are addressed.</s>
          <s>As a result, a series of difficulties in the interpretation of these images is encountered and the valuable information obtained becomes overly subjective and often meaningless.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is clear from this overview that a set of techniques specifically adapted to consider the coloured aspect of textiles, as well as other characteristics of their materiality, is needed.</s>
          <s>Standardised acquisition and post-processing methods, which have been scientifically optimised, are required to afford preliminary indications of the colourants present and facilitate comparisons between objects.</s>
          <s>In addition, a complete set of images should include both reflectance and luminescence images, that consider not only emitting materials but also their reflectance and absorbance properties, which are often characteristic and diagnostic for their identification.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To obtain such an optimised protocol, the colour-calibration of visible images (VIS) is fundamental, as it improves comparability between images taken at different times and/or locations.</s>
          <s>The creation of this high-resolution reference image, over which the other images can be registered, is important for the effective comparison and interpretation of the image set and the creation of balanced false colour images.</s>
          <s>UV-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL) can then be used to map the visible luminescence emitted from the dyed yarns and begin to relate this to their chemical sources.</s>
          <s>As discussed, infrared-reflected imaging (IRR) is useful for the documentation of staining or past restorations but can also effectively be used in the visualisation of metal threads <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Perhaps most significantly, infrared-reflected false colour (IRRFC) images can be created from the IRR and VIS images.</s>
          <s cert="0.6447762250900269" id="dataset-2" type="Image">IRRFC images can allow preliminary identification of colourants due to their characteristic appearance in false colour, as determined by their combined absorbance or reflectance properties in the visible and infrared ranges.</s>
          <s>Although rarely used in the context of textile analysis, UV-reflected imaging (UVR) can be useful for the detection of patterns, staining, surface coatings and, similarly to the IRR images, are also useful for revealing previously unseen areas of restoration and creating UV-reflected false colour (UVRFC) images.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Additionally, two novel MSI methods have been explored for the first time, which are believed to be of particular value for the study of textiles.</s>
          <s>The first of these is a luminescence technique analogous to UVL imaging, but which uses visible light, specifically blue light in this instance, as the excitation source.</s>
          <s>Visible-induced visible luminescence imaging (VIVL) has recently been applied to the study of polychrome sculpture with, among others, the notable advantage that it dispenses with the use for UV sources, thus making it safer for both user and object <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In its application to textiles the VIVL technique has a further advantage over UVL imaging, in that the longer excitation wavelength used avoids the absorption maximum of most fibres <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> , thus suppressing background luminescence from these and minimising the distracting and colour-modifying effects which this can cause.</s>
          <s>The second method is a mapping technique which specifically targets the reflectance of colourants, such as indigo, by acquiring reflectance images in multiple bands and subtracting these to produce an image which highlights the spatial distribution of the indigo-containing areas.</s>
          <s>The technique, termed multiband-reflected (MBR) imaging, is described in relation to archaeological Andean painted textiles by Webb et al. but has not hitherto been published with applications to dyed woven textiles <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Once acquired and processed, the interpretation of complex MSI images is often a source of difficulty for those who are unfamiliar or in cases where little previous reliable data exists.</s>
          <s>A further aim of this work is to provide guidelines which will aid in the systematic interpretation of these images, relating multispectral data to chemical properties, whilst discussing the advantages and limitations of this approach.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is always important to acknowledge that, depending on the detail of information needed, the photophysical properties observed and the preliminary chemical information obtained from MSI techniques requires confirmation and/or amplification using complementary techniques.</s>
          <s>Fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) remains a non-invasive approach and has shown its potential in the identification of dyes <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When the removal of samples is feasible and permissible, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) is considered the state-of-the-art technique for the investigation of dyes, as it provides information at the molecular level and can allow for the distinction of the botanical/animal sources of colourants <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref>

          <s>As a micro-invasive approach, the amount of sample needed is usually in the range of 50-100 μg (2-3 mm of fibres).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Aside from exploring the use of MSI techniques for the investigation of textiles and aiding in the interpretation of the images produced, this work illustrates how these techniques can be integrated into a multi-analytical protocol in combination with FORS and HPLC-MS (on selected samples) to provide a better understanding of historical/archaeological textiles.</s>
          <s cert="0.45830821990966797" id="dataset-3" type="Image">For the samples selected for HPLC-MS analysis, the protocol proposed additionally includes investigation by optical microscopy (OM) and the analysis of sub-samples (one-two fibres) by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) for mordant identification.</s>

        <head>Research context and aims</head>
        <p>
          <s>The protocol is here presented with specific application to Late Antique textiles from Egypt in the British Museum collection.</s>
          <s>Until recently, the origin and date of such textiles were largely determined by style and iconography.</s>
          <s>Increasingly, the application of scientific techniques is slowly over-turning long-held assumptions concerning chronology, the sources of materials and availability of dyestuffs, and providing new insights into textile production, dyeing practices, trade and the economy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For this research four objects were selected; one is from the rubbish dumps of the city of Antinoupolis <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> and three are from the Monastery of Apa Thomas at Wadi Sarga, both in Middle Egypt <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25]</ref> , as there was a strong curatorial interest in the comparison of textiles to assess differences in practice as associated with urban versus more rural, monastic contexts.</s>
          <s>A particular emphasis was placed on the use of dyes, as, in addition to informing on the skills and ingenuity of dyers in Late Antique Egypt, dye analysis can potentially provide information on trading of dyes and provenance of the raw materials.</s>
          <s>The possibility to identify such dyes, in cases where these may now have faded, also yields the opportunity to better appreciate and/ or reconstruct their original appearance.</s>
          <s>In cases where the dyes are better preserved, these studies also provide the information required with which to design and implement more responsible strategies for the display of such vulnerable textiles.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These motivations formed the context and aims of this research project, and although the increased knowledge of the materials and techniques used to create these pieces will be briefly discussed, the main focus of this paper is the important opportunity that this research provided to explore multi-spectral imaging as a tool to begin to answer these questions and to evaluate the advantages and limitations of the method when integrated into an analytical protocol.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>An additional observation is that both the UVL images of fragments A and B show clumps of fibres, which display very intense orange luminescence and are clearly not original to these pieces, as the emission is too intense for a natural dye of this period.</s>

          <s>These differences can be ascribed to the removal of the effects of background luminescence emitted by the fibres <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As discussed, the longer excitation wavelength used for the VIVL method avoids their absorption maximum, thus suppressing background luminescence, which in this case gave a blue cast to the luminescence being observed in the UVL images.</s>

          <s>The green and purple coloured stripes of the child's sock or the dark square shapes near the top of textile A (A20 and A21), which appear very dark brown in the visible image but appear very bright in the MBR image, are good examples of this.</s>

          <s>The four Late Antique textiles selected from the British Museum collection proved to be excellent case studies with which to test MSI techniques because, despite the colours appearing to be highly varied, they were obtained using a rather limited dye palette.</s>
          <s>Four main dye sources were identified, namely madder (Rubia sp.), weld (Reseda luteola), indigo (Isatis or Indigofera tinctoria) and tannins.</s>
          <s cert="0.6152256727218628" id="dataset-24" type="Tabular data">Dyes from these sources, either alone or in mixtures, were identified by combining the information obtained from MSI, according to the guidelines proposed.</s>
          <s>Differences and similarities between and within the coloured areas of the various textiles were also established and confirmed by the FORS measurements.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, some limitations were observed regarding the use of this completely non-invasive approach combining MSI and FORS.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The concentration of the dye appeared to play a role in the luminescence properties of dark red areas, which appeared to absorb or only weakly luminesce, thus complicating the interpretation of UVL images and possibly leading to the misidentification of such areas as perhaps containing insect-derived reds instead of madder.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The effects of background luminescence produced by the fibres can cause distracting and colour-modifying effects in lightly dyed or faded yarns.</s>
          <s>These effects were somewhat overcome by using VIVL methods, where the longer excitation wavelength used avoids the absorption maximum of most fibres, suppressing this background luminescence.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Moreover, yellow dyes could not be easily differentiated by FORS, as the various sources relevant to this context have very similar spectra.</s>
          <s>There was similarly a lack of diagnostic spectral characteristics for tannins and the different sources of undyed yarns.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, the investigation of double-dyed yarns appeared particularly challenging to both MSI techniques and FORS measurements, as the information produced by the underlying dye can be hidden from these surface-responsive techniques.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These limitations have been overcome by integrating the use of MSI and FORS into a multi-analytical protocol.</s>
          <s>These techniques were in fact an important aid in planning a targeted and effective sampling strategy, narrowing down the number of additional measurements necessary, and facilitating comparisons between objects.</s>
          <s>OM, SEM-EDX and HPLC-MS were then applied to these samples, providing conclusive information on the dyeing technique, the mordanting and the botanical source of the colourants, respectively.</s>
          <s>Future investigations to correlate the relative abundances of dye molecules observed in the chromatograms with the dye technique used to obtain mixed colours (double-dyed yarns and yarns composed of different colours that are dyed separately and twisted together) would be desirable.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The application of the full investigative protocol provided an increased knowledge of the materials and techniques used to create these pieces.</s>
          <s>Although the dye sources were in-keeping with that expected for the period and geographical location, these were used in ways which are testament to the subtleties of the dyers' craft in Late Antiquity; they were able to produce an entire palette of colours using combinations of just three natural colourants; indigo, weld and madder.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, the protocol described would undoubtedly be useful for the investigation of textiles in museum and historic collections more generally and future investigations are intended that will challenge the MSI approach with more complex dye palettes, such as those encountered in Asian or South American textiles.</s>
          <s>Since dyes respond differently to environmental factors, especially light, their identification is also useful for determining which textiles can be displayed safely.</s>
