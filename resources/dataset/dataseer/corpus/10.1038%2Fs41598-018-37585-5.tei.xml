          <head>Inhibition of the NGF/trkA interaction presents an interesting alternative to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and/or opioids for the control of inflammatory, chronic and neuropathic pain.</head>
          <p>
            <s>Most prominent of the current approaches to this therapy is the antibody Tanezumab, which is a late-stage development humanized monoclonal antibody that targets NGF.</s>
            <s>We sought to determine whether peptides might similarly inhibit the NGF/trkA interaction and so serve as future therapeutic leads.</s>
            <s>Starting from two peptides that inhibit the NGF/TrkA interaction, we sought to eliminate a cysteine residue close to the C-terminal of both sequences, by an approach of mutagenic analysis and saturation mutagenesis of mutable residues.</s>
            <s>elimination of cysteine from a therapeutic lead is desirable to circumvent manufacturing difficulties resulting from oxidation.</s>
            <s>Our analyses determined that the cysteine residue is not required for NGF binding, but is essential for inhibition of the NGF/TrkA interaction at pharmacologically relevant peptide concentrations.</s>
            <s>We conclude that a cysteine residue is required within potential peptide-based therapeutic leads and hypothesise that these peptides likely act as dimers, mirroring the dimeric structure of the TrkA receptor.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Nerve growth factor (NGF) was first described over 65 years ago by Levi-Montalcini &amp; Hamburger 1 and is the founding member of the neurotrophin family, which play a critical role in controlling the development and survival of neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous system 2,3 .</s>
            <s>Neurotrophins act upon two classes of receptors; the high affinity tropomyosin receptor kinases (Trk) receptors, and the low affinity p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75NTR) 4 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>NGF is of interest to the clinical community owing to its involvement in the perception of pain.</s>
            <s>When NGF binds TrkA on nociceptive neurons, it activates phospholipase C, which results in sensitisation of TRPV1, a non-selective ligand-gated channel that generates the action potential resulting in pain signal transmission 5,6 .</s>
            <s>NGF also increases TRPV1 expression and its trafficking to the plasma membrane 6,7 .</s>
            <s>Published: xx xx xxxx opeN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:930 | https://doi.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Since increased levels of NGF have been implicated in a number of pain states, including inflammatory and neuropathic pain 8 , neurogenic overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis 9,10 , prostatitis 11 , asthma 12 and cancer-induced bone pain 13 , interest has focussed on creating novel analgesics by inhibiting the NGF/TrkA interaction.</s>
            <s>Accordingly, an anti-TrkA monoclonal antibody was shown to inhibit the perception of pain in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models 14 .</s>
            <s>However to date, the most common NGF/TrkA intervention strategies have involved sequestering NGF with monoclonal antibodies 15 .</s>
            <s>Such administration has shown good analgesic effect in a number of animal models for human disease, such as fracture pain 16 , cancer pain 17 , pancreatic pain 18 and arthritic joint pain 19 .</s>
            <s>Of the various anti-NGF antibodies in clinical trials, Tanezumab has probably been the most successful.</s>
            <s>It is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to NGF 20 .</s>
            <s>Although there have been side effect profile concerns, prompting a hold on all clinical trials of anti-NGF antibodies in 2010, Tanezumab was granted fast track status by the FDA in June 2017 and positive results from Phase 3 clinical trials have been announced recently 21 .</s>
            <s>A recent study has provided preliminary evidence that efficacy and safety of Tanezumab is similar whether delivered intravenously or subcutaneously 22 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>As described above, NGF binds both to TrkA (part of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases) and to p75NTR.</s>
            <s>The Trk family share sequence homology and their extracellular regions comprise a cysteine rich domain (domain 1), three leucine rich repeats (domain 2), another cysteine rich cluster (domain 3) and two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (domains 4 and 5) 23 .</s>
            <s>These extracellular domains are linked to an intracellular kinase domain via a single transmembrane helix.</s>
            <s>A sequence homology of &gt;75% is observed for the intracellular kinase domain 24 whilst the extracellular domains show a lesser sequence conservation of 50-55% 25 .</s>
            <s>NGF binds to domain 5 of TrkA both via a 'specificity patch' and a 'conserved patch' 26 .</s>
            <s>Unsurprisingly, the 'specificity patch' of NGF has low sequence homology with other neurotrophins, whereas the 'conserved patch' contains residues conserved with other neurotrophins.</s>
            <s>Interestingly, neither of these patches are involved in p75NTR binding, which occurs via the L1, L3 and L4 loops of NGF 26 , again interacting with two distinct patches in the p75NTR receptor <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
              <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
              <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
              <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Whilst the Trk receptors bind specific neurotrophins, p75NTR, a transmembrane glycoprotein, binds all members of the neurotrophin family 31 .</s>
            <s>The cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR contains a 'death domain' , consisting of six α helices, that shares sequence homology to those found in other apoptosis inducing factors.</s>
            <s>Its extracellular domain contains four cysteine rich domains consistent with the tumour necrosis factor receptor family 32 .</s>
            <s>The cell mediated effect of NGF-p75NTR binding is dependent on the presence or absence of TrkA.</s>
            <s>If TrkA is absent, NGF-p75NTR binding will lead to apoptosis 33 whereas NGF-p75NTR binding in the presence of TrkA will increase the binding affinity of NGF to TrkA which in turn promotes survival 34 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Development of novel anti-NGF peptides or peptide mimetics to inhibit the NGF/TrkA interaction, as an alternative to antibody therapy, would be potentially more cost-effective and/or a shorter acting addition to the existing arsenal of pain-modulating therapies.</s>
            <s>Indeed, the concept of developing peptide-based analgesia relating to the NGF-TrkA pathway is not new.</s>
            <s>Peptide-based inhibitors of the NGF-TrkA interaction were first described in 1995, comprising a series of short synthetic peptides cyclised via oxidation of terminal cysteine residues 35 .</s>
            <s>Later, linear cell-penetrating peptides, synthesised as HIV Tat fusions, were shown to inhibit NGF-stimulated TrkA phosphorylation and to suppress NGF-induced TRPV1 expression in PC12 cells 36 .</s>
            <s>Subsequently one of those peptide fusions, named IPTRK3, was shown to supress inflammatory pain in rats after local injection 37 and cancer-induced pain in mice following intraperitoneal injection 38 .</s>
            <s>Peptidomimetic antagonists of TrkA have also been developed that prevent NGF/TrkA signalling 39,40 .</s>
            <s>However, recent reviews of pain therapy involving the NGF-TrkA pathway still focus predominantly on antibody-based (or small molecule) intervention, rather than peptidic alternatives 41,42 .</s>
            <s>Accordingly, we have produced and screened semi-saturated peptide libraries based on two proprietary anti-NGF peptides, that unlike the early cyclic peptides of Saragovi and co-workers 35 , have only a single cysteine residue close to their C-termini.</s>
            <s>Herein we describe the analysis of those proprietary peptides and our investigations into the possibility of mitigating the requirement for the C-terminal cysteine residues within their sequences altogether.</s>
            <s>We conclude that in common with both NGF and TrkA, cysteine residues play an essential role within anti-NGF peptides and as such are critical for effective inhibition of the NGF/TrkA interaction.</s>

          <s>Further, we demonstrate that both cysteine-containing peptide monomers and dimers inhibit the NGF/TrkA interaction, but that inhibition is enhanced in the presence of the dimeric forms of the peptides, relative to the monomeric forms.</s>
          <s>Future structural studies will be required to confirm the mode of action of the peptides described herein and indeed any other peptide-based leads.</s>
          <s>Clearly, an effective peptide-based inhibitor would be required to inhibit the interaction between the N-terminal of NGF and the specificity patch of TrkA, rather than that between the waist of NGF and the conserved patch of TrkA, since the latter shares a high degree of homology with other Trk receptors.</s>
