          <s>Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common malignant bone tumours and arises primarily in children and adolescents <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> .</s>
          <s>In adults aged &gt;65 years, OS develops as a secondary malignancy related to Paget's disease of bone 2 .</s>
          <s>To date, chemotherapy has been frequently included in conventional treatment of OS along with surgical resection.</s>
          <s>Since the 1970s, the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapies to OS treatment has impressively improved the 5-year survival rate.</s>
          <s>In addition, in patients with localized disease, the strongest predictor of overall survival is the patient's response to preoperative combination chemotherapy 3 .</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, the 5-year survival rate has remained at approximately 20% over the past 20 years without changing <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , which is partly due to chemoresistance.</s>
          <s>Cisplatin is a National Comprehensive Cancer Network first-line chemotherapy medication commonly used for clinical treatment of OS and a variety of other tumours <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
        </p>

          <s>In OS patients, cisplatin shows a response rate of approximately 30%, indicating that a significant proportion of OS patients are intrinsically resistant to cisplatin.</s>
          <s>Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to further improve the long-term survival rates of OS patients.</s>

          <s>Epigenetic perturbations caused by histone methyltransferases or demethylases are recognized as important contributing factors to a variety of tumours <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> , and epigenetic markers have frequently been found to be mutated or dysregulated in multiple cancers <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>

          <s>Since it is widely acknowledged that epigenetic modulation plays an important role in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy, introduction of agents targeting epigenetic changes could be a new anticancer therapeutic strategy to treat the chemoresistance problem in OS <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our study, we first found that NSD2 is upregulated in OS patients, especially in those who are resistant to cisplatin treatment.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we found that patients with lower NSD2 expression have better prognoses.</s>
          <s>Then we conducted several experiments in vitro and in vivo, and the results demonstrated that knockdown of NSD2 enhances OS cell apoptosis and has synergistic effects with cisplatin against OS.</s>
          <s>Lu et al. <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46</ref> likewise reported that NSD2 knockdown could inhibit OS progression, but these researchers did not further investigate the effects of NSD2 on chemosensitivity in OS.</s>
          <s>In our study, NSD2 knockdown also repressed the expression of genes associated with CSC properties, such as CD133, CD117 and SOX2.</s>
          <s>CD133 (also known as prominin-1) is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein that has been used to identify and isolate putative CSCs in several types of solid tumours <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">40</ref> , and CD117 (KIT) is also a well-known cell surface marker for stem cells <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> .</s>
          <s>SOX2 has been shown to maintain OS CSCs 48 .</s>
          <s>Besides, Tang et al. <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49</ref> reported that knockdown of SOX2 inhibited OS cells invasion and migration and Maurizi et al. <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">50</ref> also reported that SOX2 was required for OS development and proliferation.</s>
          <s>Mechanistically, GO analysis revealed several apoptotic and stem cell-related terms that were enriched for differentially expressed genes between the NSD2-KD group and the control group with or without cisplatin treatment.</s>
          <s>Upon NSD2 knockdown in OS, BCL2 and SOX2 were downregulated, but BAD was upregulated.</s>
          <s>Pathway analysis further clarified that the ERK and AKT signalling pathways might mediate the process by which NSD2 knockdown enhances OS apoptosis and strengthens cisplatin efficacy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, although we revealed direct regulation of BCL2 and SOX2 expression by NSD2, the core subunits or relevant co-factors were not elucidated.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the underlying mechanisms by which NSD2 recognizes specific genes and modulates their epigenetic modifications remain undefined.</s>
          <s>In addition, histone methyltransferases can also be involved in methylation of non-histone proteins.</s>
          <s>For example, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase SETD2 can directly bind to signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (STAT1) and promote its can directly increase H3K36me2 levels at BCL2 and SOX2 loci and activate ERK and AKT signalling pathways to facilitate OS genesis and chemoresistance.</s>
          <s>*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01 methylation on lysine 525 (K525), leading to STAT1 phosphorylation and activation 51 ; however, whether NSD2 mediates modification of certain non-histone proteins to regulate tumourigenesis or chemosensitivity warrants further investigation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In summary, our evidence of the involvement of NSD2 in OS provides a new perspective regarding possible epigenetic regulation in tumourigenesis and apoptosis as well as in chemosensitivity.</s>
          <s>The results of this study suggest that NSD2 could be a new therapeutic target in combined chemotherapy to enhance OS apoptosis and the response of OS to chemotherapy.</s>
          <s>In addition, NSD2 could be a prognostic factor for OS.</s>
          <s>Thus this study has elucidated new strategies for clinical OS treatment regimens.</s>
