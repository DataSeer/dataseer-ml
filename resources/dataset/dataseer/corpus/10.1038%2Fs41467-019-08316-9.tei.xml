          <s>Such damage to marine organisms can be expected in nature given the abundance of mismanaged plastic waste and, hence, pelagic microplastics after fragmentation present in the oceans.</s>
          <s>The amount of plastic waste in the oceans is expected to increase in the future.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One of the most important aspects of marine plastic pollution research is to quantify microplastic abundance in the present and future ocean environment.</s>
          <s>Without this, the arguments made by eco-toxicologists and/or environmental chemists may be difficult to justify because of the unrealistic density or sparsity of microplastics in their experimental design.</s>
          <s>However, mapping the microplastic abundance in the actual ocean has proven difficult, because insufficient measurements are available for all the world's oceans.</s>
          <s>Numerical model approaches are potentially capable of mapping the pelagic microplastic abundance in the past, present, and future.</s>
          <s>However, numerical models require careful validation using reliable field measurements and, therefore, the modeling studies published to date have been limited to regions where intensive microplastic surveys have been conducted using a harmonized protocol (e.g., mesh size of sampling nets, wind/wave correction, and unit) over the course of the observations <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To map the abundance of pelagic microplastics, we conducted a transoceanic survey across a meridional transect from the Southern Ocean <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> to Japan in 2016 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Stations used in a previous study <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> were added to our analyses ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Mismanaged plastic waste can escape into the natural environment, especially from countries with a high population density <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is therefore not surprising to find numerous plastic fragments in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere where plastic debris has degraded on beaches <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>A synthesis of multiple surveys conducted in the Southern Hemisphere has suggested that pelagic microplastics are less widespread than in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere 1,2 .</s>
          <s>Therefore, a remarkable contrast in the abundance of pelagic microplastics is expected across a single meridional transect, while the abundance along zonal transects is likely to be dependent on oceanic conditions, such as convergence zones (i.e., oceanic fronts) that fluctuate in both time and space.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the present study, the future abundance of pelagic microplastics over the Pacific Ocean was predicted using a numerical model that reproduced the current abundance observed in the meridional survey in 2016.</s>
          <s>The Pacific Ocean receives the highest amount (52% of the global total; Supplementary Table 2) of mismanaged plastic waste of all the world's oceans.</s>
          <s>Large amounts of microplastics have been detected around the region described as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch 1,2 , and in the East Asian seas <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
          <s>The situation in the Pacific Ocean is likely to occur, eventually in the rest of the world's oceans; thus, predicting marine plastic pollution in this region is a research priority.</s>
          <s>In addition to the single snapshot campaign in 2016, the decadal variation reported by Goldstein et al. <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> was used to validate the present model by computing the temporal series of oceanic microplastic abundance ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The present study used a numerical tracking model to predict the movements of particles representing non-conservative pelagic microplastics.</s>
          <s>They were carried by ocean currents, which were provided by an ocean analysis dataset, and by Stokes drift, which was computed using a wave model forced by satellite-derived winds.</s>
          <s>Pelagic microplastics in the upper ocean are unlikely to act as conservative matter despite their limited decomposition under natural conditions <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to transport due to oceanic motion, the ocean plastic circulation is also influenced by plastic removal processes in the upper ocean (hereinafter, referred to as a sink), such as settling to the abyssal ocean after biofouling <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> , absorption into the marine ecosystem (partly settling along with detritus) 12,28-32 , sand beaches <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> , and sea ice <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> , and fragmentation to small particles <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> , which can pass through the sampling nets conventionally used in microplastic surveys (mesh size~0.3</s>
          <s>mm).</s>
          <s>However, these sinks have not been quantified to date, and it is therefore not easy to establish numerical models that incorporate their effects.</s>
          <s>To avoid any uncertainty in determining various sinking rates, the model used in this study incorporated a single sink term, by which the modeled particles were removed randomly so that the number (Q) of particles released from a source in a year diminished to Qe −t/τ after time (t) from the particles' release.</s>
          <s>Here τ is regarded as the average transit time (turnover time) <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36</ref> of microplastics in the upper ocean, and is a single adjustable constant chosen to ensure that the modeled particle distribution is consistent with both the meridional survey observations in 2016 and decadal variation recorded by Goldstein et al. <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
          <s>The emission of microplastics should also be incorporated in models because particles are released from sources positioned around the Pacific Ocean.</s>
          <s>The number of particles released from the various sources was considered to be proportional to the current estimates of mismanaged plastic waste 23 , gross domestic product, and future plastic waste in a specific region <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref>

          <s>The abundance of pelagic microplastics was found to decrease exponentially from the North Pacific, via the equatorial Pacific and Tasman Sea, to the Southern Ocean <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In total, the number of microplastics with diameters &lt; 5 mm (mesoplastics &gt;5 mm) excluding fibers and expanded polystyrene from Sta. 20 to Sta. 38 was 932 (109), accounting for 82% (91%) of those collected across the entire meridional transect.</s>
          <s>Particle counts per unit seawater volume (hereinafter, concentration) decreased as we moved southward <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 3a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>An exponential curve (C 0 10 λφ ; −63.5°&lt; φ &lt; 34.2°in latitude) was fitted to the concentration in a least square sense, where C 0 and λ (slope) were 0.02 pieces m −3 and 0.0072 degree −1 , respectively, with a significant correlation coefficient (0.42) suggested by the t test with a 95% confidence level.</s>
          <s>Particle counts integrated over the water column (hereinafter, total particle count) were less dispersed than the concentrations because of the wind/wave correction (see Methods for the conversion of metrics) <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 3b</ref> ).</s>
          <s>An exponential curve fitted to the total particle count of microplastics had C 0 and λ of 7.6 × 10 4 pieces km −2 and 0.0097 degree −1 , respectively, with a correlation coefficient of 0.53, which was significant at the 99% confidence level according to a t test.</s>
          <s>Averaging the latter exponential curve over the latitudes of 30°-40°yielded an approximate total particle count in the mid-latitudes of the South Pacific of around 35,000 pieces km −2 , an order of magnitude smaller than that in the North Pacific (~160,000 pieces km −2 ).</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the total particle count at Sta. 38, the northernmost station, reached 8,800,000 pieces km −2 , which was an order of magnitude larger than in the North Pacific.</s>
          <s>This was consistent with Isobe et al. <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> who found that the East Asian seas are a hotspot of pelagic microplastics.</s>

          <s>Average transit time of microplastics in the upper ocean.</s>
          <s>Overall, the particle-tracking model in the absence of both the sink term (i.e., τ → ∞) and fishery-based sources did a good job of reproducing the meridional contrast such that the microplastic abundance in the North Pacific was an order of magnitude larger than that in the South Pacific <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> ; the relatively minor contribution by fishery-based sources are shown later at the end of the Results section.</s>
          <s>Likewise, in the East Asian seas (&gt;30°N), the modeled abundance that was two orders of magnitude larger than that in the South Pacific is likely to occur in reality, because the abundance averaged over the grid cells north of 30°N (red arrow in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> ) was close to the previous estimate over the East Asian seas around Japan (dot and bar) 7 .</s>
          <s>The model without the Stokes drift demonstrated that the total particle counts in the North Pacific were shifted northward compared to the model with the Stokes drift ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was therefore suggested that the model underestimated the meridional contrast of the microplastic abundance, especially for less buoyant particles, with smaller sizes and/or a denser polymer composition, moving beneath the layers subject to wind-wave influences.</s>
          <s>An in-depth comparison between the modeled microplastic abundance and the observations produced a plausible estimate for the average transit time (τ).</s>
          <s>In the North Pacific where pelagic microplastics were abundant along the transect <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> , the meridional contrast evaluated by the slope (λ) of the exponential curve was overestimated as τ decreased <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 5a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>When 1 year was chosen for τ, the slope was 46% larger than the observation, suggesting that microplastic abundance in the model decreased southward more rapidly than projected.</s>
          <s cert="0.9878193140029907" id="dataset-2" type="Tabular data">The decadal increase of the microplastic abundance measured by the weight per unit seawater volume (weight concentration; see Methods for the conversion of metrics) 3 was overestimated as τ increased; see <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> where the abundance increased unrealistically in the model when τ was longer than 10 years.</s>
          <s>Therefore, a choice of τ between 1 and 5 years was likely to be appropriate to minimize the root mean square error of both the slope and decadal variation, when the models with different τ were compared with observations (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> ).</s>

          <s>The high concentrations occurred mostly at 30°N, with a remarkable seasonality, whereby the weight concentration was higher in the boreal summer due to the weakened vertical mixing of pelagic microplastics under calm oceanic conditions.</s>
          <s>In addition, it was found that the weight concentration in the boreal summer was higher in the western part of the study area, along the 30°N band.</s>
          <s>Weight concentrations in the South Pacific were much smaller than those over the North Pacific, irrespective of the season.</s>
          <s>This meridional contrast was consistent with the results of a transoceanic survey in 2016 and, thus, both observations and model results indicated that marine plastic pollution was ongoing, particularly in the North Pacific.</s>

        <p>
          <s>From the model prediction, the eccentricity of the pelagic microplastic distribution remained remarkable after 50 years <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">(Fig. 6c, d)</ref> .</s>

          <s>Box 3 is located in the eastern North Pacific where a massive amount of floating macroplastic debris has been reported <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, much higher weight concentrations were predicted in boxes 1 (East Asian seas) and 2 (central North Pacific).</s>
          <s>The weight concentration of surface zooplankton (hence, biological production) was high in boxes 1 and 2 (green stipples in <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">Fig. 6e)</ref>

          <s>Therefore, attention should be given to the western and central Pacific Ocean where marine organisms may encounter environmental risks due to pelagic microplastics in the future.</s>

        <p>
          <s>It is worthwhile to examine how the prediction depends on the model design, because the present study provides part of the process to guide future research on marine plastic pollution.</s>
          <s>First, the results of the additional experiment using fishery-based sources (Numerical modeling in the Methods section) differed little from the model of only land-based plastic waste around the 30°N-band in the North Pacific ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This is because the modeled particle count increase, due to additions from the fishery sources, was ultimately adjusted to the observed abundance at Sta. 38 in the meridional survey in 2016.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, in both 2016 and 2066, the weight concentration off South America was slightly higher than that in the model of only land-based plastic waste, because the ratio of fishery-based plastic waste from Chile and Peru accounted for 16.4% of the total amount (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> ), and this ratio was much higher than that of the land-based plastic waste (1.3%; Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The contribution of the fishery to pelagic microplastic abundance was not conclusive in the present study due to the ad hoc estimate of plastic waste generated by the fishery.</s>
          <s>It is nonetheless noteworthy contribution, particularly in waters west of South America.</s>
          <s>Besides fishery-based plastic wastes, abundance of pelagic microplastics west of South America might be underestimated to some extent because of the lack of microplastic transport from the South Indian Ocean via a surface superconvergence pathway <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41</ref> Pacific (closed circles), while b is the same but for total particle counts.</s>
          <s>The digits 1, 2, 20, and 38 by the marks denote the station numbers.</s>
          <s>The regression lines between locations versus microplastic abundance on a log 10 -scale are shown in each panel with the correlation coefficient (r) and confidence level (e.g., p &lt; 0.05 means 95%) suggested by a t test.</s>
          <s>The estimates provided by Reisser et al. <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> are given in b (green dots) and show that the different surveys also suggest a remarkable meridional contrast, i.e., an abundance in the South Pacific that was one order of magnitude smaller than that in the North Pacific <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 5e</ref> , f) suggested that secular variations in the surface circulation are of critical importance to determine accumulation regions of pelagic microplastics.</s>

          <s>These results suggest that this discrepancy was resolved by setting the life expectancy (3 years in the present model) of microplastics in the upper layer.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We next consider how the non-persistent microplastic scenario performed in the present model.</s>
          <s>First, although an approximation, the 3-year timescale was nonetheless appropriate to reproduce the long-term evolution determined by the balance between emission and removal of microplastics in the model.</s>
          <s>Second, the timescale was appropriate to reproduce the meridional transect along which the northern waters contained much more microplastics than those of the south.</s>
          <s>The abundant microplastics in the north were likely to occur because microplastic emission in the western North Pacific (1 and 2 in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> ) was greatest among all sources, and because frequent oceanic convergence zones trapped pelagic microplastics around 30°N throughout the year (subtropical convergence zone; <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Closing the Indonesian Archipelago in the model was unlikely to reduce the amount of microplastics in the south, because the Indonesian Throughflow flowing westward <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45</ref> prevents microplastics in the Indian Ocean from moving toward the Pacific Ocean.</s>
          <s>The particle sources and time lapses in the model without the sink term (i.e., τ → ∞) demonstrated that 60% of the particles along 140°E from the Equator to 15°N in February 2016 originated from Central America (8 in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref> , and that non-negligible fraction of particles had time lapses ranging from 3 to 8 years <ref target="#fig_7" type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref> .</s>

          <s>The seasonality of the concentrations was remarkable <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref> , such that the weight concentrations in the North Pacific from April to September exceeded those in the rest of the year.</s>

          <s>Half of the total SPM (most with diameters &lt; 10 μm) in the North Pacific is non-organic <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> and, therefore, pelagic microplastics are likely to become the predominant non-organic SPM before the 2060s.</s>
          <s>The weight concentration in the eastern North Pacific (3) increased more slowly than those in the two western boxes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This was because the sources of microplastics were located mostly in the western North Pacific <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> , and because the time taken for microplastics to reach the eastern North Pacific was longer than 3 years in the subtropical gyre.</s>
          <s>Note that the weight concentration in the model without the sink term (τ → ∞) increased as we moved to the east (blue dots in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> ).</s>

          <s>According to the predictions of the present model, weight concentrations around 10 3 mg m −3 are likely to occur by the 2060s despite the nonpersistent properties of microplastics in the upper ocean.</s>

          <s>However, neither fragmentation to microplastics &lt;0.3 mm nor their removal processes from the upper ocean are conclusive at the present time.</s>
          <s>Likewise, dense concentrations of microplastics with sizes &gt; 0.3 mm are potentially harmful to fish, due to ingestion, by 2060s, although both effects <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49</ref> and uptake 50 are dependent on particle size.</s>
