            <s>Some of these substrates are metabolised in the epithelium during this process.</s>
            <s>To identify the specific proteins involved in these processes, we used proteomic technologies.</s>
            <s>Protein extracts were prepared from ventral rumen tissue of six sheep fed a fibrous diet at 1.5× maintenance energy requirements.</s>
            <s>Using a newly developed method, we were able to enzymatically isolate the epithelial cells from underlying tissue layers, thus allowing cytosol and membrane fractions to be independently analysed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS).</s>

          <s>This is probably due to their relatively low abundance in relation to other subcellular locations and their hydrophobic nature.</s>

          <s>Identification of EGFR and several proteins with EGF repeats indicates that these cytokines are likely involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of the rumen epithelium, probably in the basal cells.</s>
          <s>Our identification of TGFβ induced protein (TGFβ1) is novel in rumen epithelium.</s>
          <s>This protein has been found to be secreted, induced by TGFβ and associated with normal skin and adhesion of dermal fibroblasts <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[44]</ref> or keratinocytes <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a study of calf rumen epithelium development during weaning, TGFβ1 was found to be an important transcriptional regulator of gene expression networks on certain diets <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[46]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Little is known about the exact function of this cytokine in adult tissue, which presents an opportunity for a more thorough exploration of its function in the rumen epithelium.</s>
          <s>Other cell specific factors that have diverse regulatory functions in cells, were enzymes associated with prostaglandin and arachidonic acid metabolism.</s>

          <s>Our procedure allowed the identification of proteins involved in nutrient absorption and trafficking transported through integral membrane proteins and possibly endocytosis.</s>
          <s>In particular, those that form the barrier function and formation of cell-cell junctions were identified.</s>
          <s>Many of the proteins involved with the electron transport chain apparatus were identified, as were key enzymes involved in ketone body formation.</s>
          <s>In combination with transcriptome studies, a comprehensive understanding of cellular function and gene networks operating in the rumen epithelium will emerge.</s>

          <s>We identified intermediate filaments typical of basal and cornified epithelium.</s>

          <s>In addition to structural, nutrient transport and metabolism proteins, those that regulate cell growth, differentiation and signalling are reported.</s>
