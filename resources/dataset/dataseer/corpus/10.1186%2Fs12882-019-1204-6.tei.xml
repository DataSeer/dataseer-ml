            <s>The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of garlic extract in lowering inflammatory markers in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.</s>
            <s>Methods: In this parallel-designed double blind randomized clinical trial, 42 PD patients at the Shafa dialysis center, Tehran in 2017 were included.</s>
            <s>The primary outcome in this study was systemic inflammation which was evaluated by measuring the concentrations of IL-6 and CRP and ESR in serum.</s>
            <s>Results: Baseline versus after-intervention median (IQR) of IL-6 (pg/ml), CRP (mg/L) and mean ± SD of ESR (mm) in garlic and placebo groups was 2.2 (0.8, 6.4) versus 0.7 (0.6, 1.2) (p &lt; 0.001) and 2.0 (0.8, 2.1) versus 0.6 (0.6, 0.8) (p = 0.002), 13.0 (5.0, 14.0) versus 2.0 (1.0, 9.0) (p &lt; 0.001) and 7.0 (2.0, 10.0) versus 6.0 (3.7, 7.5) (p = 0.547) and 35.4 ± 21.7 versus 50.7 ± 28.5 (p = 0.021) and 46.0 ± 26.0 versus 45.3 ± 22.3 (p = 0.797).</s>
            <s>Median (IQR) of Percentage Before-After change in CRP was − 71.4%(− 85.7, − 42.9%) and − 20.0%(− 30.0, 114.3%) in garlic and placebo group respectively.</s>
            <s>The Mann-Whitney U test indicated this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The results imply that administrating 400 mg of standardized garlic extract twice a day for 8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in IL-6, CRP and ESR.</s>

          <s>We observed that the levels of IL-6, CRP and ESR significantly decreased after the end of 8-week period in garlic-treated group.</s>
          <s>Similar to our study, Mozaffari-Khosravi et al. <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> investigated the effect of garlic on pro-inflammatory markers in 44 postmenopausal osteoporotic women and did not observe a significant difference in inflammatory cytokines of IL-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) between garlic and placebo groups.</s>
          <s>They saw a significant reduction in TNF-α just in garlic group after the intervention <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A small sample size may be a cause for insignificant results in both studies.</s>
          <s>According to a systematic review, garlic can reduce inflammatory markers, including CRP and TNF-α.</s>
          <s>This study concluded that high concentration CRP increases the odds of coronary artery disease (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.25-1.68)</s>
          <s>and that garlic consumption can improve cardiovascular health via lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In an in-vitro study, a significant reduction was seen in several inflammatory biomarkers including tumor TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, T-cell interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and IL-2, in the presence of ≥10 μg/ml garlic extract in inflammatory bowel disease <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ghodsi et al. observed that administration of garlic extract along with regular swimming trainings for 8 weeks was effective in reducing age dependent renal tissue inflammation in normal rats <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>So, garlic can be considered as a useful natural herb in inhibition of inflammation.</s>
          <s>The advantageous effects of garlic on health are due to organosulfur compounds in it <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ban et al. indicated that thiacremonone, a sulfur compound from garlic, prohibits Nuclear Factor Kappa B NF-κB activation through interacting with sulfhydryl group of nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) molecules <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Lee et al. identified some sulfur-containing compounds from garlic including Zand E-ajoene and oxidized sulfonyl derivatives of ajoene that inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Considering the fact that elevated values of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with greater odds of developing coronary artery disease <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> and therefore, an independent predictor of mortality in ESRD patients <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , we suggest to administrate garlic in these patients as a beneficial remedy.</s>
          <s>About secondary outcomes, we observed a significant increment in serum potassium level in garlic treated group than control group.</s>
          <s>A similar finding was also reported by Oluwole <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> in studying the effects of garlic on some biochemical parameters.</s>
          <s>He concluded that garlic can help in maintenance of electrolyte balance.</s>
          <s>According to this claim, enhancing sodium and potassium reabsorption following garlic administration can improve renal function.</s>
          <s>In addition, he believed that the ameliorating effect of garlic on hypertension can be partly explained by this mechanism, i.e., increasing renal reabsorption of basic electrolytes such as sodium and potassium due to probable incremental effect of garlic on renal blood flow may secondarily relieve the hypertension.</s>
          <s>Meanwhile, Pedraza-Chaverri et al. <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> indicated that garlic is effective in improving renal injury induced by potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) due to its antioxidant properties.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Other checked secondary outcomes were lipid profile, liver; renal and peritoneal function, parathormon and homocysteine.</s>
          <s>We observed a significant reduction in cholesterol concentration within both groups.</s>
          <s>Majority of this reduction was higher in garlic treated group than placebo treated group (− 9.30% versus − 8.4%, respectively).</s>
          <s>However, similar to Doorn et al. <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> we didn't observe a significant difference between two groups.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Regarding the fact that high concentration of these inflammatory markers can be a serious life threat for peritoneal dialysis patients, we suggest that this safe and well-tolerated natural substance be prescribed in an attempt to attenuate the inflammatory response in these patients.</s>
          <s>However, the assessment of these effects in larger trials is strongly recommended.</s>
