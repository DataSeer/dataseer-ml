        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) which include anxiety, depressive, adjustment, and somatoform disorders <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> are prevalent worldwide.</s>
          <s>In a systematic review conducted in 2004 which included 21 papers representing 13 high-income countries, Bennett et al. <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> reported that about 10% of women experienced 'depression' (although most studies had ascertained outcomes with symptom checklists and not diagnostic interviews), during pregnancy.</s>
          <s>The rate is much higher in lowand middle-income countries.</s>
          <s>Fisher et al. <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> reviewed all available papers published to 2010 from lowand lower-middle-income countries.</s>
          <s>The review found 13 studies but from only nine low-and lower-middle-income countries.</s>
          <s>The review reported a weighted mean prevalence of antenatal CMDs in these settings of 15.6% (95% CI, <ref type="bibr">15.4-15.9</ref>
          </s>
          <s>).</s>
          <s>The latest systematic review of antenatal 'depression' published in 2016 which included 51 studies published from 1998 to 2015 and representing 20 lowand middle-income countries.</s>
          <s>The study found that a pooled prevalence of 'depression' during pregnancy was 25.8% (95% CI, 22.8-29.0)</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This review reported significant heterogeneity and publication bias between studies <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This could be possible explanations for the much higher prevalence in this review than those of the previous study.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, these reviews showed that the prevalence of antenatal CMDs is high worldwide.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Some determinants of antenatal CMDs in general circumstances have been established.</s>
          <s>Lancaster et al.'s <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> systematic review of 'risk factors for depressive symptoms during pregnancy' included 57 studies from the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand published from 1980 to 2008.</s>
          <s>They found in univariable comparisons that life stress, anxiety, a personal history of depression, lack of social support, unintended pregnancy, domestic violence, less education, lower income, smoking, being the single and poor quality of relationship were more common among with than those without antenatal depressive symptoms.</s>
          <s>When all were entered into multivariable analyses, life stress, lack of social support and domestic violence remained significantly more common among women with than without symptoms.</s>
          <s>Fisher et al.'s <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> systematic review from lowand lower-middle-income countries also reported that lack of support, socio-economic disadvantage, unintended pregnancy and intimate partner violence were risks and having more education, a permanent job, and a kind and trustworthy intimate partner protected against CMDs of women who were pregnant or had recently given birth <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is limited empirical research about the links between experiences of a disaster and prevalence of antenatal CMDs.</s>
          <s>Harville et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> conducted a systematic review of 'disasters and perinatal health' in 2011 and included ten papers reporting findings of the mental health of women who were pregnant or had recently given birth and had experienced a natural or a 'technological' disaster.</s>
          <s>The review found that exposure to a disaster can be stressful and that the mental health of women who are pregnant or in the postpartum period may have adverse consequences for the child's development and that these might be greater than the direct effects of the disaster <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ren et al. <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> reported similar findings in their systematic review of eight papers on 'mental disorders of pregnant and postpartum women after earthquakes'.</s>
          <s>Some studies had examined factors other than the disaster as determinants of antenatal CMDs and found that poor social support and the poor family relationship may increase the risk of perinatal CMDs <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These two systematic reviews included some papers reporting experiences of earthquakes, other natural disaster and antenatal CMDs and indicated that earthquake might increase the risk of antenatal CMDs <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic review of the prevalence and determinants of antenatal CMDs among women who recently experienced an earthquake.</s>
          <s>Antenatal CMDs among women is a global concern not only because of the burden and limits to participation in everyday affairs but also because of the risk to the neurocognitive development of the growing foetus and adverse pregnancy outcomes <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, it is well-established that a history of antenatal CMDs is a risk factor for postnatal depression <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The aim of this study was to identify and synthesise the evidence available about the prevalence and determinants of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who have recently experienced an earthquake.</s>

          <s>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the evidence available about clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who had recently experienced an earthquake.</s>
          <s>It provides a narrative synthesis of the existing evidence, but we acknowledge that because of the heterogeneity of these studies, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and provide meaningful estimates of the prevalence of pregnancy mental health problems among women who have experienced an earthquake.</s>
          <s>We also acknowledge that as the review was limited to the English-language literature, it is possible that articles published in languages other than English have been missed.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, this review provides a comprehensive summary and evaluation of the available evidence in the field.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Only seven studies, all from high and middle-income countries met inclusion criteria for this review.</s>
          <s>They reported a wide range of prevalence of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs.</s>
          <s>The differences in prevalence estimates might be attributable to study methods, but, as has been found in other post-disaster research, can reflect the local circumstances and post-disaster responses <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Standard study methods include the use of an adequately powered sample size, following standard sample recruitment strategies, and the use of valid and reliable outcome measures.</s>
          <s>The studies had varied sample size-small to relatively large-and none justified the sample size or representative adequacy of the samples.</s>
          <s>This could bring varied results of prevalence of antenatal CMDs.</s>
          <s>In addition, different measures of psychological symptoms were used, which reduces comparability and might account in part for the wide variation in prevalence estimates.</s>
          <s>Most importantly, only two studies <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> used cut off scores that had been established in formal local validation studies among pregnant women.</s>
          <s>Without valid cut off scores, the prevalence estimates cannot be assumed to be accurate.</s>
          <s>It is not clear, therefore, how confidently the findings may be generalized.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There were differences in earthquake characteristics and settings which might also have influenced the outcomes.</s>
          <s>It is likely that women who were near the epicentres had more severe earthquake experiences compared to those up to 90 km away and they were more likely to experience a higher prevalence of antenatal CMDs.</s>
          <s>For instance, Lau et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> reported 7.1%, and Ren et al. <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> reported 35.2% depressive symptoms using EPDS cut off score &gt; 14 among women who experienced the earthquake during pregnancy.</s>
          <s cert="0.9841797351837158" id="dataset-6" type="Tabular data">While Ren et al. <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> recruited pregnant women from the area of the epicentre of an earthquake scoring seven on the Richter Scale, Lau et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> recruited pregnant women from 90 km away from the epicentre of an earthquake scoring eight on the Richter Scale.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The wide prevalence estimates of pregnancy mental health problems might also be attributable to local circumstances and post-disaster response.</s>
          <s>Compared to the prevalence reported from China, the prevalence in Japan was consistently lower.</s>
          <s>Japan is a well-resourced country with experience of earthquakes and well-developed post-disaster practices.</s>
          <s>These may assist more rapid recovery of post-adversities and explain why Japanese women appear to have a less negative psychological impact from experiencing an earthquake.</s>
          <s>In general circumstances too, Japanese have less prevalence of mental health problems compared to other high-income countries <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, women in rural China may experience greater loss of close relatives, housing and livelihoods but may delay receiving support from significant others <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may explain the higher prevalence in China.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the prevalence reported in Japan in an earthquake context was higher <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> than those reported among non-earthquake affected pregnant women <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> in Japan.</s>

          <s>Dong et al.'s study <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> conducted four years after the Sichuan, China earthquake showed a high prevalence of depressive symptoms.</s>
          <s>However, the prevalence was not statistically significantly different to what has been reported from the sample of their comparison group that was recruited from a different location.</s>
          <s>To our knowledge, there is no study that conducted in the non-earthquake context in Sichuan, China to report the prevalence of antenatal CMDs.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, Lee et al.'s study <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> that was conducted in general circumstances in an antenatal clinic of a regional hospital in Hong Kong, China found that pregnant women experienced a high prevalence of depressive symptoms: (22.1% (95% CI, 19.9; 24.4%) at first trimester, 18.9% (95% CI, <ref type="bibr">16.8; 21</ref> .1%)</s>

          <s>Even though Hong Kong is not directly comparable to Sichuan because of their socio-economic differences, it indicates that pregnant women in Sichuan experienced a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in an earthquake context <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> than the prevalence among pregnant women in Hong Kong <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was reported that the Chinese government together with international agencies provided prompt support including psychological counselling immediately after the earthquake <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>That support could ease the impact of the earthquake on pregnancy mental health.</s>
          <s>It can also be interpreted as the post-disaster effect on antenatal depressive symptoms may reduce over the time <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While these studies contribute to enhancing understanding of the field, they do not show clearly whether and how much earthquake experiences determine the mental health of pregnant women.</s>
          <s>Without a robust examination of potential factors together with earthquake experiences, it is not possible to conclude whether and how much earthquake experiences contributed to increasing mental health problems during pregnancy.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This systematic review found that women with recent direct experience of an earthquake appear to be at higher risk of clinically-significant antenatal CMD symptoms.</s>
          <s>These findings have implications for disaster responses.</s>
          <s>At present, the recommendation in this situation is that provisions for a safe birth and neonatal care <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> should be a priority.</s>
          <s>These data indicate that the mental health of women who are pregnant should also be considered and addressed.</s>
          <s>Pregnant women who reside in direct hit area or closer to the epicentre of the earthquake require special attention and support.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It also identifies knowledge gaps, in particular, that there is no evidence about the mental health of women who are pregnant and living in low-income nations at the time of an earthquake.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is clearly a priority, that, despite the difficulties of conducting ethical, sensitive, comprehensive, culturally-competent research in such situations, it is needed in order to provide the evidence to inform effective interventions.</s>
          <s>At a minimum, this research should include standardised measures of earthquake experiences and examine all potential risk and protective factors in order to delineate the nature, prevalence and duration of antenatal mental health problems among women.</s>
