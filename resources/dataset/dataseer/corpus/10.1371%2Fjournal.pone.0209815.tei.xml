            <s>km from the nearest facility (AOR: 1.722, 95% CI: 1.450, 2.045) as were women who lived 25 km or more (AOR: 2.098, 95% CI: 1.176, 3.722.881).</s>
            <s>Women who were not married had lower odds of utilizing a MWH when compared to married women (AOR: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.369, 0.941).</s>
            <s>Over half of mothers using a MWH prior to delivery reported problems at the MWH related to boredom (42.4%), management oversight (33.3%), safety (33.4%), and quality (43.7%).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Providing shelter near an obstetric facility for women living in remote geographic areas prior to delivery is not a new concept <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Descriptions of Maternity Waiting Homes (MWHs) date back to the 1950's <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> with examples of their use on multiple continents <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a recent Maternal Health Lancet Series, Campbell et al. <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> identified MWHs as one solution to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality by bringing women living in hard-to-reach areas closer to a hospital or health center that provides Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Maternity Waiting Homes, sometimes called Mothers' Shelters or Maternity Waiting Shelters, are facilities that house women in the last few weeks of pregnancy with easy access to a health care facility capable of providing EmOC <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Once labor begins, women can easily transfer to the health care facility for delivery, thereby providing access to a skilled provider for intrapartum care.</s>
          <s>Multiple models of MWHs are described in the literature from risk-based models (i.e.</s>
          <s>women with risk factors are encouraged to stay in a MWH to decrease poor outcomes) <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> to models that follow a national strategy (i.e., any pregnant woman is allowed to stay at a MWH prior to delivery) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The concept of risk-based models influenced some of the early development of MWHs based on the premise that selecting women with risk factors and advising them on the use of a MWH prior to delivery could help prevent poor outcomes, consequently playing an important role <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Models that do not use a risk approach often are intended to improve access for women living the farthest distance from the health facility, allowing women to reach the facility in time for delivery <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In 2015, as part of a coordinated evaluation effort, the Maternity Homes Alliance for Zambia was formed between the government of Zambia, donors, implementing partners, university evaluators, and the Saving Mothers Giving Lives (SMGL) project, to provide robust data for decision-makers on the effectiveness of MWHs in Zambia as an intervention for improving maternal and newborn health outcomes.</s>
          <s>All partners supported the concept of MWHs as a health system strengthening effort.</s>
          <s>During a 2014 formative evaluation of existing MWHs in rural Zambia, we found MWHs varied from a space within the clinic for women to sleep at night while sitting outside during clinic hours, to make-shift structures with poor amenities and few beds <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Based on our formative data findings and to provide generalizable data, the Maternity Homes Alliance reached a consensus on a minimum core model for MWHs in rural Zambia with criteria within three domains: (i) infrastructure, equipment, &amp; supplies, (ii) policies, management and finances, and (iii) linkages and services.</s>
          <s>At the time of the survey, 20 MWHs were being constructed or refurbished to meet the minimum core model near a rural health facility capable of providing Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC).</s>
          <s>An additional four MWHs were under construction near a district level hospital with Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) capacity.</s>
          <s>These newly constructed or refurbished MWHs will allow the Maternity Homes Alliance to evaluate whether the minimum core MWH model increases access to high quality intrapartum care among mothers living farthest (defined as greater than 9.5 km from a health care facility).</s>
          <s>Development of the minimum core model responded to community input from our formative research to improve the physical structure of MWHs, strengthen local governance and ownership, and maximize the sustainability of the model over time <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The purpose of this study is to report on baseline data obtained prior to the opening of the minimum core model MWHs in three provinces in Zambia.</s>
          <s>We asked participants (i.e., mothers who gave birth during the previous 13 months) about where they delivered, whether they used a MWH, and their perceptions (i.e.</s>
          <s>quality and safety) as well as their experiences with existing MWHs in their districts.</s>

          <s>Zambia is a land locked country in sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
          <s>At the time of the survey, there were 10 provinces and 74 districts.</s>

          <s>While the country has had marked improvements in maternal health, a woman's lifetime risk of maternal death remains high at 1 in 79.</s>
          <s>It is for these reasons that Zambia was chosen as one of two original countries in subSaharan Africa to take part in a five-year public-private partnership aimed at accelerating reduction in maternal and newborn mortality <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Launched in 2012, SMGL takes a health systems approach to improve access to clean, safe childbirth services and timely emergency care for pregnant women <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>

          <s>To ensure facilities included in the study are resourced appropriately to adequately manage obstetric complications, 40 rural health facilities, located within 2 hours of travel time to a CEmONC referral facility were selected from a list of eligible facilities that met the following inclusion criteria: (i) capable of performing a minimum of 5 of the 7 BEmONC signal functions and (ii) providing intrapartum care to a minimum of 150 women per year; or (i) staffed with at least one skilled birth attendant on staff, (ii) routinely providing active management of third stage of labor, and (iii) having no stock outs of oxytocin or magnesium sulfate in the last 12 months.</s>
          <s>We chose 12 months to ensure facilities had stability in commodities and human resources.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Although no standardized model of MWHs yet exists in Zambia, over a third of all women delivering at a health care facility within the seven SMGL rural districts included in the survey used a MWH prior to delivery.</s>
          <s>Household characteristics of the study population reflect those of the general population in rural Zambia <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Mothers who lived 15 km or greater from a health care facility were more likely to use a MWH than women who lived within 9.5-9.9</s>
          <s>km from a health care facility.</s>
          <s>These findings are similar to those from a study of MWH use for high-risk referrals at a district level hospital in Zambia, reporting an average distance of 22 km from place of residence to hospital for 218 MWH users <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our findings also corroborate those of Mramba et al. <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> who found the majority of women (n = 327) who used one MWH in Kenya lived at a distance of greater than 20 km.</s>
          <s>In contrast, a study conducted in Timor-Leste of MWH use, found the majority of women in two rural districts, 80% and 62% respectively, lived within 5 km of a health center <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One reason our findings may vary from these results is that our sample is only among those women living greater than 9.5 km from the health facility.</s>
          <s>Additionally, a study of 615 women referred to a MWH for high risk conditions in Ethiopia traveled an average distance of 42 km <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Unmarried mothers in our study had lower odds of MWH use when compared to married women.</s>
          <s>This finding could be related to the social stigma women face with premarital pregnancies in Zambia, <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> although future research is needed to examine the relationship between non-marital status and MWH use more thoroughly.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Overall, only 67% of all births take place in a health care facility throughout Zambia; <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> yet, 81% of women surveyed reported delivering at a health care facility.</s>
          <s>This high prevalence of facility use in our sample is most likely due to the significant interventions associated with the SMGL partnership in the seven districts; including community mobilization and sensitization messages encouraging facility delivery.</s>
          <s>This is further supported by the fact that the lowest number of facility deliveries out of the seven districts occurred in Pemba and Choma <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Both districts are in the "second phase" of the SMGL initiative and have not had sufficient time to reflect the benefits of the program.</s>
          <s>Saving Mothers, Giving Life has had unprecedented success with a reported 38% reduction in maternal mortality in target SMGL facilities in Zambia <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, it should be noted that the lowest MWH use was reported from two SMGL phase one districts, Mansa and Chembe.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While overall women were satisfied with their stay at a MWH, over half noted crowdedness and nearly a third reported problems with the physical quality of the MWH as well as with their interaction with staff.</s>
          <s>Again, this reflects earlier findings that women were satisfied with their MWH stays but that areas for improvement included the physical characteristics and resources <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>While this study employs a robust study design, it is limited by its focus on the SMGL districts and this constrains generalization.</s>
          <s>An analysis of MWH use in communities that have not been sensitized by the SMGL program may have elicited very different results.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the initial focus was on communities 10 km or farther from a health facility; however, once geo-coding was completed it was determined that nearly 13% of the communities in the identified districts were less than 10 km from a health facility (thus households 9.5 km or farther were incorporated into the final analysis).</s>
          <s>While geo-location is commonly used to incorporate geographic and spatial data into a visual analysis, there are limitations when considering the topography of a location.</s>
          <s>Additionally, pregnancy complications and obstetric risk was not examined in the survey.</s>
          <s>Finally, the limitation of obtaining data through a cross-sectional analysis of self-reported behavior from up to 13 months prior allows for the potential of social desirability and recall bias.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study is the first to describe the prevalence of MWH use and characteristics of the women using health care facilities for birth and choosing to stay at a MWH in seven SMGL districts of rural Zambia.</s>
          <s>The results presented here show success in districts that are part of the SMGL initiative with higher rates of facility delivery than the general population of rural Zambia.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Maternity waiting homes, which currently take many forms in Zambia, are being used by over a third of women delivering at a health facility in our study.</s>
          <s>These MWHs appear to be bridging the distance barrier for women who live greater than 9.5 km from a health care facility.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Areas for further improvement include the physical structure of MWHs to accommodate more women in a high quality facility as well as the opportunity to provide educational sessions on a myriad of topics such as newborn care or family planning while women are awaiting childbirth.</s>
          <s>Additionally, our findings highlight the need to examine the stigma associated with premarital pregnancy and develop opportunities for unmarried women to participate more fully in the health care system.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Maternity waiting homes are one strategy to improve access to skilled birth attendants for women living the greatest distance from a health care facility.</s>
          <s>Women in these seven districts in Zambia have received messages promoting facility birth and are seeking care within the health system structures.</s>
          <s>As the quality of both the MWH structures and the care received at the health care facility improves, MWHs have the potential to serve many more women and contribute to the improvement of maternal and newborn outcomes in rural Zambia.</s>
