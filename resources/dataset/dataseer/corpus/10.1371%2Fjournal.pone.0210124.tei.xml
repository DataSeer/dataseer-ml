        <p>
          <s>Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for groups at high-risk for severe influenza infections, including pregnant women and HIV-infected individuals <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a placebo-randomized clinical trial we reported that immunization of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected pregnant women with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) was safe, immunogenic and partially protected the vaccinated women against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza-illness <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although influenza vaccination during pregnancy increases maternal hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibodies, we reported that HIV-infected pregnant women had inferior humoral HAI response compared to HIV-uninfected women, including lower percentages with HAI titers �1:40 post-vaccination (49%-67% vs. 85%-98%, respectively) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The lower HAI response in HIV-infected women did not, however, translate into inferior vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza compared to HIV-uninfected women (57.7% vs. 50.4%,</s>
          <s>respectively) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These data indicate that IIV may confer protection to HIV-infected individuals by mechanisms other than HAI antibodies.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The HAI assay is the most commonly used methodology to determine responses following influenza vaccination because of its relative correlation with protection, as well as its ease of performance, good standardization between laboratories and low price <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This assay detects antibodies to the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) that can prevent agglutination to sialic-acid residues on erythrocytes, HAI titers only measure antibodies that block receptor binding of the virus to host cells, and it is only a correlate of the capacity of antibodies to inhibit viral infection of host cells in the respiratory tract <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another serological assay for determining influenza-specific antibodies is microneutralization (MN); this functional assay directly measures antibodies that neutralize influenza virus infection, by evaluating the ability of antibodies to prevent virus entry, and viral replication that can occur in infection-permissive mammalian cells lines in vitro.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The MN assay therefore measures the functional capability of antibodies at a specific dilution, rather than just the total quantity.</s>
          <s>Compared to HAI, MN assay measures a broader repertoire of antibodies <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, MN assays have been shown to detect strain-specific antibodies against the immunodominant HA head domain and antibodies targeting the more conserved HA stalk domain.</s>
          <s>HA stalk-specific antibodies are known to mediate a number of important effector functions through their Fc-region including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Assays measuring neutralizing antibodies reportedly are also more sensitive than HAI assays for detection of low level of antibodies and for diagnosing influenza infection <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The MN assay has, however, higher technical complexity, is more difficult to perform for clinical laboratories, and standardization across laboratories can be problematic.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite the extensive use of these two laboratory methods, only a few studies have formally compared immune responses to inactivated vaccine by both assays <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>We show that the MN assay was in general more sensitive than the HAI assay in detecting influenza-specific antibody seroconversion post-vaccination, including in HIV-infected individuals.</s>
          <s>Overall, there was strong correlation between MN and HAI results.</s>
          <s>Other studies have also demonstrated close association between the two assays <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> , although the relationship between HAI titers and corresponding MN titers may be different for different influenza strains.</s>
          <s>The use of MN assay in clinical trials of vaccines is uncommon but its enhanced sensitivity has been demonstrated before <ref type="bibr">[9-11, 14, 16]</ref> ; although a recent phase I randomized clinical trial in Serbia assessing sero-responses to seasonal IIV found that GMTs and fold-increase in titers post-vaccination were higher by HAI than MN assay <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The controversial results with HAI in the literature may be due to the high technical variability of the assay added to the biological variability of the host.</s>
          <s>The technical variability of the HAI assay is linked to the source of the antigen, of the red blood cells used for the hemagglutination and the operator subjectivity.</s>
          <s>Quality control programs for standardization of influenza HAI or MN assays are not currently available, but they would be extremely helpful in ensuring comparability of studies.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Traditionally, HAI antibody titers �1:40 are associated with 50% reduction in the risk of influenza infection or disease in healthy adults <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Less is known about the MN titer threshold that correlates with protection, but it has been suggested that effectiveness estimates against PCR-confirmed influenza are higher with the MN assay at similar titer thresholds <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A household study in Hong Kong, assessing the ability of MN and HAI antibodies to predict protection against PCR-confirmed A/H3N2 infection in children and adults reported that titers of 1:40 by MN assay correlated with 49% protection while by HAI were associated with only 31% <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover a recent study found that HAI titers of 1:40 for A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 in children corresponded to MN titres of approximately 1:200 and 1:140, respectively <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The sample size of our study was too small to determine what MN-titer had a protective effect, but of the eight women with a PCR-confirmed influenza infection during the entire study period, six had MN titers �1:28 to the putative strain within 53 days of infection; and in only two HIV-infected women MN titers were 1:453 and 1:1280.</s>
          <s>Similar to our results two studies assessing the immunogenicity of inactivated monovalent influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic vaccines in HIV-infected children and young adults (n = 39) or adults (n = 84) found that post-vaccination GMTs and seroconversion rates were higher for MN than HAI assay <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Influenza infections in immunocompromised patients are associated with prolonged illness and viral shedding, and increased morbidity and mortality <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The ability of HIV-infected individuals to mount a protective immunological response to influenza vaccine has been evaluated in a limited number of studies that provided evidence for the poor immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in this population <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As we described before for HAI antibodies <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , the immune response to IIV in HIV-infected women assessed by MN assay was significantly lower than that observed in HIV-uninfected women; the similar vaccine efficacy observed in the two study cohorts <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> could, however, be due to the fact that post-vaccination MN GMTs were &gt;1:100 for the three strains and this may well have been above the protective threshold.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The ability of the MN assay to detect functional antibodies able to neutralize the virus may imply that this assay measures a greater repertoire of antibodies involved in protection <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is also possible that other immune mechanisms, such as HA stalk-specific antibodies, NA <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In general, low baseline antibody levels have been associated with higher fold-increases after vaccination <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Especially in adults, when assessing humoral responses to influenza vaccines the influence of pre-vaccination titers either due to natural infection or previous vaccination should be taken into account when assessing response with MN or HAI assays.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A limitation of our study was that the infecting viruses were not sequenced; if the infecting strains were drifted compared to the vaccine strains, the HAI and MN titers against the vaccine strains are probably not very relevant for protection.</s>
          <s>The fact that the two serological assays were performed in different laboratories during different periods is a limitation of our study, although we obtained good correlations between the two methods.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The European medicines agency has recently issued new guidelines on licensing of novel influenza vaccines in Europe emphasizing the importance of quantifying not only HAI antibodies but also functional antibodies as a measure of vaccine immunogenicity.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the guidelines state that the protective threshold of HAI titers �1:40 no longer should be used <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is particular relevant for special populations such as the HIV-infected where mechanisms other than HAI antibodies may play a major role in protection.</s>
