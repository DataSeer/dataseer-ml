        <p>
          <s>Using the new approach of PET/MRI, we identified increased metabolic activity in lymph nodes or lung parenchyma in approximately one third of heavily-exposed household TB contacts.</s>
          <s>Although there were few study eligibility criteria, healthy contacts who are motivated to enter a study and undergo a PET scan may differ from the general population of household contacts and this, together with the small sample size, means that the prevalence estimate may not be generalizable to the broader population of contacts.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the frequency of metabolic abnormalities appears much higher than the expected prevalence of active TB in this population (in a meta-analysis of 108 studies from high-income settings, the prevalence of active TB among contacts was only 1.4% <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We did not scan a control population without household exposure to TB for ethical reasons and for funding and practical limitations.</s>
          <s>Most of the lesions had relatively low SUVmax values and interpretation of these depends on the background rate of lesions with low-level uptake in the normal population.</s>
          <s>A large study in Japan reported findings from 155,456 healthy people scanned with PET/ CT <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Only 212 (0.14%) had some form of false positive inflammatory change in lung, and no lymph node false positives were reported.</s>
          <s>This supports our interpretation that the reported abnormalities in our study lie outside expectations for a healthy control population.</s>
          <s>In contrast, another study of 179 healthy controls scanned with PET/ CT identified visually increased FDG uptake in hilar nodes in 28% of individuals <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, none of these nodes had an SUVmax over 3, and even using this high threshold as the limit of the normal range would not negate our findings (two patients had higher SUVmax values; and the high threshold does not apply to parenchymal disease).</s>
          <s>One contact was identified as having diffuse FDG uptake within the lung parenchyma with no underlying structural abnormality on MRI, the significance of which is uncertain.</s>
          <s>This may be due to embolization of injected FDG, although this has previously been reported to produce a discreet focus of uptake rather than diffuse uptake <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While we cannot rule out all alternative explanations for the abnormal findings such as recent viral infection, TB is by far the most likely explanation given the circumstances (definite ongoing household exposure to a known case of TB, and a high IGRA positive rate (40%, compared to a rate of 12.7% in the local population <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Our findings are also plausible because studies using CT have also identified abnormalities in up to a third of TB contacts <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , and the nature and distribution of FDG uptake on PET/MRI is consistent with a study using PET/CT that reported lymph node activity in four of five TB contacts <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We did not find any statistical correlation between FDG abnormalities and degree or timing of exposure, which is surprising if the changes are due to TB exposure.</s>
          <s>This may be due to the small sample size.</s>
          <s>The aetiology of the abnormal lesions that we observed is uncertain.</s>
          <s>They may represent an early stage of TB infection with active but low-level mycobacterial replication, sometimes referred to as "incipient disease" <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another possibility may be that the FDG lymph node uptake represents transient immune activity following mycobacterial antigen presentation, which might potentially result in control or clearance of infection.</s>
          <s>The modest FDG activity (SUVmax 2-4) compared to active TB (typically 10-12) is consistent with either interpretation <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is unknown whether presence of such early lesions might identify individuals at higher risk of subsequent progression to active disease.</s>
          <s>Asymptomatic HIV co-infected patients with abnormalities on PET/CT suggestive of subclinical TB had a higher risk of developing subsequent active clinical disease <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the lesions in that study were mainly parenchymal lesions, whereas we found mainly lymph node abnormalities.</s>
          <s>We did not systematically follow up the contacts, although offered a repeat scan in those with changes (three agreed to have repeat scans after an interval of 6 months (range 182-193 days) but showed no evidence of progression).</s>
          <s>We also searched the national treatment database for longer term outcomes and found that none had relapsed.</s>
          <s>However the median duration of follow up (2 years) was relatively short and these findings might confer a higher risk of relapse in the longer term.</s>
          <s>Although HIV was not tested as part of the study, no contact had known HIV and the background prevalence of HIV in the local population is only 0.001% <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a population with a low overall risk of reactivation, and a small sample size, the absence of any cases of observed progression does not negate the possibility of increased risk of re-activation in those with PET/MRI abnormalities (larger studies would be needed with more practical biomarkers to determine this, see below).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The high prevalence of abnormalities we observed are even more remarkable given that we did not limit recruitment to contacts who were IGRA positive; we recruited independent of IGRA status because we did not want to assume a priori that PET/MRI would be normal in those who did not mount an IGRA response following TB exposure.</s>
          <s>Indeed there was no correlation between IGRA and scan abnormalities.</s>
          <s>The IGRA test is based on the T-cell response to infection and the observed PET activity also most likely reflects the immune response as uptake by metabolically-active bacilli is likely small given the low bacillary burden in this early disease stage.</s>
          <s>The lack of concordance between the two investigations may simply be due to the small sample size, but might also reflect the difference between the standardised antigenic stimulation with IGRA <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , and the natural immune response which is likely to evolve between exposure and scan.</s>
          <s>Although the scans were performed promptly after the identification of a contact, the time for the index case to present introduced an unavoidable delay in time between first exposure and scan, during which resolution may have occurred.</s>
          <s>MRI has higher sensitivity than CT for detecting nodal involvement in patients with active pulmonary TB <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previous studies investigating PET in TB have all used PET/CT.</s>
          <s>As lymph nodes appear to be the commonest site of subclinical pulmonary activity in TB contacts, PET/MRI may possibly be a preferred imaging modality over PET/ CT in research studies in TB contacts.</s>
          <s>PET/MRI has the additional advantage of lower radiation dose than PET/ CT, which may be important for research applications in healthy contacts.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>Given the cost, radiation dose and practical challenges involved in implementing at scale in large numbers of contacts, it is unlikely that PET-based imaging will find a clinical role in the screening of TB contacts.</s>
          <s>However, it may have considerable value in research studies for defining underlying differences in disease status that are missed by the traditional clinical screening methods.</s>
          <s>The ability to characterise clinical status in more detail may provide a foundation for future studies to identify a simpler and cheaper biomarker that may reflect these subclinical changes seen on PET/MRI.</s>
          <s>However prior to this larger PET imaging studies would be necessary to confirm if the population with subclinical FDG uptake indeed represents a population at higher risk of future reactivation.</s>
          <s>Such biomarkers could then be applied on a much larger scale for testing TB contacts and following outcomes, to determine whether these changes are predictive of relapse.</s>
