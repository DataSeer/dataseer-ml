          <s>In this work, we intend to develop and study a chemical reaction-driven supramolecular system that not only shows living supramolecular polymerization but can also be synthesized transiently by regulating various molecular cues.</s>
          <s>Our group has designed supramolecular amphiphiles and exploited their electronic prowess on a device structure <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>One system that stands out of the many in terms of its materials applications is the charge-transfer (CT) amphiphile comprising of tetra potassium coronene salt 1 as donor and amphiphilic methyl viologen as acceptor <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36</ref> .</s>
          <s>The supramolecular polymers comprising of this CT amphiphile shows excellent conducting properties.</s>
          <s>However, this system lacks dispersity control and its mechanistic aspects could not be studied owing to a very fast self-assembly and hence functional control was lacking.</s>
          <s>For a better structural and temporal control, herein we have employed a dynamic imine bond chemistry to kinetically control the formation of this supramolecular polymer <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The design involves the conversion of non-assembling CT complex (1.2, inactive/dormant state) between aromatic donor 1 and benzaldehyde substituted viologen acceptor 2 <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a</ref> , for synthesis refer Supplementary Method and Supplementary <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 1 and 2)</ref> into a self-assembling CT amphiphile (1.2-nA, active state) via an in situ kinetically controlled imine bond formation with an alkyl amine (nA, fuel) similar to inactive and active states of protein monomers in biological assemblies which can be triggered by a fuel.</s>
          <s>Various amines have been investigated in this study to leverage the supramolecular polymerization tendencies and explore the mechanism of temporal supramolecular polymerization.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Inter-dependency between reactivity and growth.</s>
          <s>Since the covalent bond formation is a kinetic process, it is envisaged that the resulting temporal control would be a two-way street.</s>
          <s>By this dual control, we refer to the fact that the extent of self-assembly would depend on the amount of amine present.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the equilibrium constant of the imine formation would be driven by the self-assembling species (which refers to the fact that alkyl chains incapable of forming aggregates would consume less 1 and vice versa).</s>
          <s>Studies were performed in an aqueous buffer of pH 11.</s>
          <s>This was fixed due to a combination of factors as pH 11 gave maximum imine formation and minimal side reactions in the time period of investigation.</s>
          <s cert="0.9234558939933777" id="dataset-1" type="Spectrometry">To probe this interdependence of reactivity and growth, we performed sequential 1 H-NMR and UV-vis studies (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The extent of aldehyde consumption in case of 1 H-NMR and the supramolecular polymerization induced changes in the CT band, were hence tabulated with various alkyl amines (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> ,d).</s>
          <s>Peaks in 1 H-NMR remained fairly similar from blank up until n-hexylamine (3A, 5A, and 6A).</s>
          <s>Beyond this the addition of 2-ethyl hexylamine (2E6A), n-octyl amine (8A), and n-dodecyl amine (12A) showed remarkable changes in the pattern of spectra; signifying a self-assembly process (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Concurrently, higher homologues of alkyl amine (2E6A, 8A, 12A) showed much higher aldehyde consumption than smaller homologues of alkyl amines (3A, 5A, 6A).</s>
          <s>This result propagates the idea of an assembly-driven equilibrium.</s>
          <s>As the intensity of the CT band is inversely proportional to the proximity of donor and acceptor molecules, i.e., smaller the distance, higher is the CT strength, hence upon self-assembly the distance between the donor and acceptor decreases and a significant enhancement in absorbance of the CT band should be observed.</s>
          <s cert="0.85557621717453" id="dataset-2" type="Spectrometry">Considering this scenario, the absorption spectra of each of the samples were recorded and their absorbance at 515 nm (to signify the increase in absorbance) was tabulated against the alkyl amine used (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The components of the mixture remained in solution throughout the experiment and hence negated any scattering-induced effects.</s>
          <s>The results obtained were in coherence with the 1 H-NMR data.</s>
          <s>Longer alkyl chains (2E6A, 8A, 12A) showed a much higher tendency to assemble than smaller alkyl amines (3A, 5A, 6A).</s>
          <s>Hence, longer alkyl chains have enough amphiphilicity to undergo supramolecular polymerization and thus they pull the imine bond formation equilibrium and a high extent of imine formation and self-assembly is observed.</s>
          <s>In contrast, smaller alkyl chains form imine only by their reactive capacity and are not driven to higher consumption due to low potency of aggregation.</s>

          <s>Elucidation of growth characteristics.</s>
          <s>Moving ahead we wanted to analyze the temporal control that this system exhibits and for doing the same we selected 8A as the representative amine showing a high degree of imine formation and self-assembly (12A showing a different mechanism has been discussed in parallel in the Supporting Information).</s>
          <s>The kinetics of growth was initially followed by time-dependent changes in solution viscosity <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>A clear growth profile observed validates the in situ self-assembly process.</s>
          <s>This could be further elucidated by the fact that at higher concentration (10 mM) a gel was formed suggesting the existence of linear assembly of 1.2-8A (inset, <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The kinetics of 1.2-8A formation was also followed by 1 H-NMR (aldehyde consumption), UV-vis absorption (CT band at 515 nm), and dynamic light scattering (kcps measurement) (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 4, Fig. 1d</ref> , e).</s>
          <s>All the three experimental techniques displayed a timedependent evolution with similar rate constants ( 1 H-NMR: 2 × 10 −3 s −1 , absorbance: 3 × 10 −3 s −1 , and dynamic light scattering (DLS): 3.2 × 10 −3 s −1 ) suggesting that imine formation is intertwined with the growth of supramolecular polymer of 1.2-8A.</s>
          <s>These rate constants are a cumulative measure of a nucleation and elongation process which has been detailed with further studies in this work <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">40</ref> .</s>
          <s>The observations are important as this is a prerequisite for a chemical fuel-driven assembly.</s>
          <s>Concentrations of in-active and active states should be controlled by the chemical fuel.</s>
          <s>This would further prove vital in controlling the characteristics of growth and decay in these assemblies (vide infra).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To further elucidate the growth characteristics, a key experiment would be to study the pH dependence of growth.</s>
          <s>This is because the imine bond formation is highly dependent on the nucleophilicity of the amine and hence is a factor of pH.</s>
          <s>Timedependent absorption trends at 515 nm with varying pH from 7 to 9.6 to 11 suggest that higher the pH, higher and faster is the conversion due to the presence of higher amount of deprotonated amine <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>We further added variable equivalents of 8A into a solution of 1.2, and as expected, with higher equivalents of 8A higher and faster formation of 1.2-8A was observed <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The trend of longer supramolecular polymers formation with higher amounts of 8A was observed in DLS measurements, corroborating with the UV-vis trends (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Figure 5)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the absorption trends observed were visibly sigmoidal in nature pointing out towards a nucleation-elongation growth mechanism (inset, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref> ).</s>
          <s>For further insights, the kinetic growths were fit to Finke's two-state model and nucleation constants were extracted <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41</ref> .</s>
          <s>The nucleation rate constant (k n ) was observed to increase with the increased equivalent of 8A added (from 9.6 × 10 −4 s −1 for 0.3 eq. to 4.4 × 10 −3 s −1 for 1.0 eq.).</s>

          <s>Contrary to convention, in the present case, the process of addition of seed to fresh monomer solution is different as we can form the seed in situ by addition of 8A in batches instead of adding 1 eq.</s>
          <s>as has been done in previous experiments (Supplementary .</s>
          <s>To a solution of inactive CT complex 1.2, 8A was added in two subsequent batches of 0.5 eq. each <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2d</ref> ).</s>
          <s>First addition evolved in a sigmoidal trend with k n being 5.8 × 10 −4 s −1 .</s>
          <s>The second batch however was devoid of the sigmoidal characteristics.</s>
          <s>Similar observations were made as <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 10</ref> ).</s>
          <s>It should be noted that an increase in the degree of aggregation is smaller in first batch addition as compared with subsequent additions.</s>
          <s>We believe that the difference in alpha during subsequent additions is a manifestation of imine formation being uniquely linked to nucleation and aggregation characteristics.</s>
          <s>Since the subsequent additions happen in the presence of nuclei their conversions are higher.</s>
          <s>A similar phenomenon is observed while variable amine addition in batches (vide infra).</s>
          <s>To further strengthen the argument, we performed the batch growth study also through scattering (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We observed a clear size increase on subsequent addition of 8A.</s>
          <s>This change in size as well as non-sigmoidal growth of the incoming monomer signifies that as the seed is formed subsequent monomers are recruited at the interface to stabilize the interfacial energy.</s>
          <s>We also took advantage of the variability in alkyl chains and excavated deeper into understanding the seeded aggregation process <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2f)</ref> .</s>
          <s>To a mixture of 1.2-8A seed, various amines were added <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2f</ref> , <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 11</ref> ), their growth profiles were subsequently compared to one with un-seeded amines.</s>
          <s>Remarkably, we observed that nucleation rates were visibly enhanced in most cases.</s>
          <s>These experiments cumulatively prove convincingly that 1.2-nA shows a seeded behavior.</s>
          <s>Seeded experiments with higher alkyl chains (12A) were also performed and showed similar characteristics ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Figures 12-20)</ref> .</s>

          <s>Having established the growth mechanism spectroscopically, we went ahead to seek further proof if this seeded supramolecular polymerization has the structural characteristics of a living supramolecular polymer.</s>
          <s>Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the dried samples of 1.2-8A showed the presence of one-dimensional structures ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 21a,b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These fibers, however, were the bundles of molecular assemblies as suggested by their width which ranges from 30 to 100 nm.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, cryo-TEM analysis clearly showed molecular fibers of almost constant width of 6.6 nm ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 21c</ref> -e) which corroborated with the cylindrical micellar packing that has been observed in covalent homologues <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>Cryo-TEM experiment also clearly proved that the assembly is indeed linear and thus justifying our molecular design parameters.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, to investigate the structural control in these supramolecular polymers, we carried out cryo-TEM studies on nucleated 1. Controlling the growth kinetics of supramolecular polymerization through ligand dilution.</s>
          <s>Although imine bond formation assisted in living supramolecular polymerization, we envisaged to further control the supramolecular polymerization process by delaying the nucleation process with an action similar to profilin on actin filaments 32 .</s>
          <s>This competition of substrates has largely been limited to libraries which do not form extended assemblies <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref>

          <s>Thus, considering the uniqueness of current system it was hypothesized that a competition between two amine substrates, one with higher reactivity but no aggregation (ethanol amine (EA)) and the other with higher aggregation tendencies (noctyl amine (8A)) could result in a retarded growth of supramolecular polymers <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4a, ligand dilution)</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a preliminary experiment to a completely grown 1.2-8A solution, 60 eq. of EA was added and an immediate disassembly was observed, establishing the fact that addition of EA can result in the formation of non-assembling imine species (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 23</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Going ahead with the controlled growth rate experiment, various equivalents of EA (0-30 eq.) were thus added in tandem with 8A into a solution containing 1.2 <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Twenty-five times retardation in the growth was observed (for 30 eq., k n = 1.8 × 10 −4 s −1 ) compared with the blank aggregate growth that did not contain EA (k n = 4.4 × 10 −3 s −1 ) (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Figure 24</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We believe this slowing down is because of the fact that an additional equilibrium has been introduced in the solution with the addition of EA which is competing for 1.2 population.</s>
          <s>EA being in excess and exhibiting higher reactivity consumes 1.2 population to form 1.2-EA, however as 1.2-8A begins to form and starts to polymerize there is an attrition in 1.2-EA population which gives way to a lesser reactive product with 8A but more energetically favorable due to self-assembly which 1.2-EA cannot undergo.</s>
          <s>Temporal control that can be exerted on the growth of extended supramolecular polymers exemplifies the simplicity and scope of development in the present system.</s>

          <s>Controlling the growth kinetics of supramolecular polymerization through delayed activation.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, since here we use alkyl amines (nA) with pKa around 8.3, change of pH in this window can lead to varying percentages of protonated and pristine amines, in turn becoming a tool for reactivity and selfassembly control.</s>
          <s>Therefore in the present system, a temporal and gradual increase in pH would retard the fast nucleation by slow activation of monomers.</s>
          <s>Urease is an enzyme that acts on urea at low pH to yield ammonium hydroxide that increases the pH temporally.</s>
          <s>Hence, coupling fuel-driven growth to urease would add an extra kinetics of pH change and this finite time of activation of amines would thus decide the retardation produced in the nucleation of 1.2-8A supramolecular polymers <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4b</ref> , delayed activation) <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, ammonia can also have some imine formation and thus delay the growth as in the case of EA giving two-step inhibition of spontaneous growth (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 26b</ref> ).</s>

          <s>For supramolecular polymerization experiments, urea and buffer concentration was thus fixed to be 400 and 200 mM, respectively.</s>
          <s>Enzyme concentration was varied from 30 to 133 U/ml.</s>

          <s>This delay of course was also dependent on 8A concentration again reiterating the fact that this assembly is due to imine formation alone (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 29a</ref> ).</s>
          <s cert="0.9405771493911743" id="dataset-4" type="Tabular data">Since the time course of this growth results in scattering, the kinetics were monitored at a red-shifted wavelength (650 nm) <ref type="figure">(Supplementary Figure 29b)</ref> .</s>

          <s>As we aim towards attaining living and transient characteristics from a single system, we next attempted to control the decay of these supramolecular polymers.</s>
          <s>Since the assembly is governed by imine formation, we again took advantage of the fact that these bonds are highly pH sensitive.</s>
          <s>Thus, to disassemble the supramolecular polymer, the pH needs to be decreased from basic to neutral (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 31)</ref> and hence a stimulus that can not only change pH gradually but also is kinetically delayed, is required.</s>
          <s>This delay is necessary as fast immediate pH quencher would not allow any growth to occur as the time required to reach the neutral pH would be too less.</s>
          <s>To fulfill this scenario, we employed saponification of esters as a potential chemical agent <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref>

          <s>Esters in the presence of base consume hydroxyl ions to facilitate their hydrolysis into carboxylate (until the pKa is reached) and alcohol and thereby decreasing the pH.</s>
          <s>Various esters hydrolyze at different rates depending on their structural and electronic constraints, thus the abundance of structural diversity of esters allow us to choose from a plethora of molecules such that the selected ester fits the kinetic requirement.</s>
          <s>For the present study, we choose gamma-Butyrolactone (γ-BL), epsilon-Caprolactone (ε-CL), and beta-Butyrolactone (β-BL) as hydrolyzing esters as their saponification reaction, which results in decrease in pH, is fairly gradual making it ideal for use (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 31)</ref> .</s>

          <s>To see the changes in the UV-vis absorption spectra, we followed the kinetics of 1.2-8A and recorded individual spectra with time lapse <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Supplementary Figure 32)</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a prototype, the experiment was done with 500 mM of γ-BL with starting pH = 11.</s>
          <s>It can be clearly seen that the absorbance increases with the maxima shifting from 492 to 505 nm signifying the growth phase.</s>
          <s>Consequently, it starts to decrease gradually and finally comes back to similar absorbance with maxima at 500 nm, signifying the disassembly/decay phase.</s>
          <s>This process was then followed at 515 nm for all the three lactones (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 33)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This clearly suggests a growth phase and a decay phase.</s>
          <s>The lifetime of the decay phase could not only be modulated with the concentration of lactones but also with the kind of lactone.</s>

          <s>However, as the lactone is varied this lifetime can be increased to roughly 950 s (β-BL, ε-CL).</s>
