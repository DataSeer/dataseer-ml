        <p>
          <s>Anemia during pregnancy is a significant health problem in Ethiopia with a prevalence rate as high as 30% <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It poses a major threat to maternal and child survival, contributing to poor pregnancy outcomes, poor cognitive/physical development, and decreased work productivity <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A large body of evidence suggested that anemia in pregnancy has an adverse effect on fetal growth which is an important predictor of children's immediate and future health <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In combination with obstetric hemorrhage, anemia during pregnancy is estimated to be responsible for 17-46% of cases of maternal death in Africa <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, some studies revealed that anemia could play a secondary role in nearly all maternal cases in resource-poor setting <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) anemia in pregnancy is defined as hemoglobin (Hb) levels &lt; 11.0 g/dl in the first and third trimester of pregnancy and &lt; 10.5 g/ dl in the second trimester of pregnancy.</s>
          <s>However, a cut off of 11.0 g/dl has been used for anemia independent of gestation in most circumstances <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There are two classification systems for anemia; based on red cell size (morphological) and underlying pathologic mechanisms.</s>
          <s>Using red cell size as a criterion, anemia can be classified as microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemia.</s>
          <s>In microcytic anemias, with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) less than normal (&lt;80 femtoliters (fL)), iron deficiency or malabsorption, thalassemia and other genetic defects in hemoglobin synthesis are the major etiologies.</s>
          <s>Macrocytic anemia occurs when mean MCV is above normal level(&gt;100 fL), and are mainly caused by Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and Liver Diseases.</s>
          <s>Normocytic anemia (MCV 80-100 fL) is majorly due to anemia of chronic infection and inflammation, multiple causes and hemolysis or blood loss.</s>
          <s>Based on underlying mechanism anemia is classified as hypo proliferative (decrease in RBC production) or maturation abnormalities (increase in RBC loss or destruction) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In economically poor women, multiple anemia etiologies can coexist due to the poor quality of life and poor diet <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>High prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies that have roles in hemoglobin synthesis such as vitamin A, vitamin B12, folic Acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2) has been reported in isolated studies in Ethiopian pregnant women <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When multiple micronutrient deficiencies coexist in the same individual, it is possible that a deficiency of one micronutrient influences the etiology, treatment of another micronutrient deficiency <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite the presence of such complex etiological factors of anemia in resource-poor setting, anemia control programs have been focusing on iron deficiency.</s>
          <s>Supplementation of iron tablets with or without folate is the most widely used approach to control the global problem of anemia <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Ethiopia, daily iron supplementation for at least 6 months during pregnancy and 3 months postpartum is an integral part of Antenatal Care (ANC) services <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of maternal anemia, maternal mortality, the risks of premature birth and low birth weight <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, recent studies reported the failure of IFA supplementation to restore hemoglobin concentrations to normal <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> and certain populations do not benefit from universal iron supplementation at all <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In low resource-setting, anemia is more likely to have complex, multiple causes.</s>
          <s>In these situations, supplementation normalizes iron stores, whereas low hemoglobin concentrations persist indicating that other micronutrient deficiencies are limiting hemoglobin response to iron supplements <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Due to limited laboratory facilities, hemoglobin concentration is frequently used as a tool for testing anemia.</s>
          <s>However, hemoglobin measurement alone cannot determine the cause of the anemia.</s>
          <s>As a result, the specific underlying causes of anemia and their relative contributions cannot be determined from the available data in Ethiopia, making the diagnosis of the true etiological factor difficult.</s>
          <s>The aim of this study was to characterize anemia, and the changes in hematological profiles in pregnant women receiving IFA supplementation using RBC morphology and treatment response as a tool.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Though several studies have determined the prevalence of anemia in Ethiopian pregnant women, data on specific anemia etiology is still limited.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, recent studies revealed that magnitude of anemia attributable to iron deficiency varied from region to region and several other factors could play a major role in low hemoglobin and anemia <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, we tried to characterize anemia, and identify its causes using hematological responses to universal IFA supplementation and RBC morphology as a tool.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study revealed that hemoglobin response to IFA supplementation was inadequate or poor in 48.5% of the study participants.</s>
          <s>This was slightly higher than the reports of Tahaineh et al from Jordan (43.1% non-response rate) <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since we included patients that were adherent and consumed IFA supplementation for at least one month, non-compliance and short duration are not the likely causes for the failure of hemoglobin response.</s>
          <s>Instead, lack of response to IFA supplementation could be attributable to other etiologies or functional iron deficiencies.</s>
          <s>While absolute iron-deficient anemia promptly responded to IFA supplementation, anemia of chronic infections or inflammation and multiple causes such as combined micronutrient deficiencies lead to functional iron deficiencies which impair iron utilization <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Iron for erythropoiesis in bone marrow is mainly obtained from re-use of iron from senescent RBCs and other cells by macrophages, dietary/supplement iron absorption in the duodenum, and release of stored iron from hepatocytes <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Chronic infections/inflammations and combined micronutrient deficiencies obstruct cellular iron export to extracellular fluid for utilization by erythroid precursors in bone marrow, restricting iron recycling and then impairing erythropoiesis <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Similarly, the morphology of the anemias found in this study was suggestive of functional iron deficiency or multiple causes <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, normocytic hypochromic anemia was the commonest pattern of anemia in the study participants followed by normocytic normochromic anemia.</s>
          <s>Hypochromic erythrocytes with low MCH (25% and/or MCHC (71.4%), which are indicators of ineffective hemoglobinization of erythrocytes as a result of functional iron deficiency <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> , were common.</s>
          <s>During anemia of chronic infections, inflammations, and concurrent micronutrient deficiencies, iron stores are adequate, but there is impaired iron delivery to the developing red cell.</s>
          <s>As a result, the hemoglobin content of newly synthesized RBC will be decreased (hypochromic) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, normocytic hypochromic anemia was significantly <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, this may not be necessarily due to the effect of supplementation alone.</s>
          <s>Our results also indicated that IFA supplementation improved neither the mean values of MCH and MCHC nor the proportion of pregnant women with low MCH and MCHC.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>On the other hand, the proportion of normocytic normochromic anemia remains almost unchanged after supplementation in our study.</s>
          <s>As this type of anemia is characteristics of functional iron deficiencies, supplementation may not improve it.</s>
          <s>The proportion of microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is an indicator of iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia and sideroblastic anemia was not changed after supplementation.</s>
          <s>In fact, the proportion was slightly increased from 5/50 to7/27 anemic pregnant women.</s>
          <s>The main reasons for this may be either malabsorption and the presence of concurrent micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A or due to other genetic defects in heme synthesis that can cause the same RBC morphology.</s>
          <s>In agreement with this, previous studies found a better hemoglobin response in pregnant women receiving IFA supplementation when other micronutrients such as vitamin A were included <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Generally, it is believed that iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia (~50%) during pregnancy and has been the main focus of anemia control programs in pregnant women in Ethiopia.</s>
          <s>In contrast, our RBC morphology and IFA treatment response data do not support this general notion.</s>
          <s>Instead, only small proportions of anemia (~10%) attribute to iron deficiency.</s>
          <s>This was also in line with findings of Gebreegziabher and Stoecker in southern Ethiopian women of reproductive ages.</s>
          <s>Using multiple iron biomarkers, the authors found only 5% of iron deficiency anemia from 21.5 total anemic cases identified, supporting that iron deficiency may not be a major contributor of anemia in Ethiopia pregnant women as it is predicted before <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .This suggests the need to consider anemia attributable to factors other than an iron deficiency in designing effective public health intervention program for anemia control.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, large doses of iron supplements in those who are not in real iron deficiency may lead to iron overload in pregnant women.</s>
          <s>Iron overloading following supplementation can induce production of free radicals and oxidative damage via Fenton reactions.</s>
          <s>This in turn associates with the initiation of various pathogenic processes such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathologies, and cancer <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, studies have shown that iron overload is associated with poor clinical outcomes in infectious diseases <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>

          <s cert="0.9955156445503235" id="dataset-11" type="Tabular data">We also evaluated the different sociodemographic, maternal and clinical factors that can contribute to poor hemoglobin responses to IFA supplementation.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant association between poor hemoglobin responses after treatment and studied factors such as educational level, household size, and parity, the presence of other illness, stage of pregnancy and, coffee consumption.</s>
          <s>Though coffee is recognized as an inhibitor of non-heme iron absorption <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> , we do not find significant association between coffee consumption and failure to respond treatment.</s>
          <s>But those who consumed iron without time preference were more likely to have poor responses.</s>
          <s>Pregnant women started their iron treatment lately in their second and third trimesters had more risks of failure to respond to the treatment.</s>
          <s>Similarly, pregnant women with 3 or more gravidity were also more likely to have poor responses.</s>
          <s>This was in line with previous studies' report on the impact of parity and gravidity on severity anemia <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study has some limitations.</s>
          <s>Firstly, we did not measure the serum value of other micronutrients such as zinc, vitamin A, B vitamins and inflammatory markers that could affect treatment responses.</s>
          <s>Secondly, it could have been better if we monitored serum iron parameters such ferritin level at baseline and after treatment along with hematological responses to get further information on iron bioavailability and rule out the different causes of anemia.</s>
          <s>Finally, longer follow up studies on IFA supplementation response and effect starting from the first trimesters could be important to monitor the significance of the supplementation program in the local population.</s>

As several possible factors can cause this morphologic abnormality, the morphologic of RBC can be changed as the causes are altered overtime</figDesc>
