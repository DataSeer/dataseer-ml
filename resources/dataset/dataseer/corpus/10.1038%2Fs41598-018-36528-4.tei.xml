            <s>The measured quantities, which differed considerably for different peptides, lipid-membranes, AFM tips (prepared under identical conditions), and retraction speeds of the AFM cantilever, could not be described in terms of the standard theory, according to which detachment occurs along a single pathway, corresponding to a diffusive escape process across a free energy barrier.</s>
            <s>In particular, the prominent retraction speed dependence of k(F) was a clear indication that peptide-lipid membrane dissociation occurs stochastically along several detachment pathways.</s>
            <s>Thereby, we have formulated a general theoretical approach for describing P(F) and k(F), by assuming that peptide detachment from lipid membranes occurs, with certain probability, along a few dominant diffusive pathways.</s>
            <s>This new method was validated through a consistent interpretation of the experimental data.</s>

            <s>Peptide-lipid interactions are essential for understanding numerous cellular processes and their mechanisms.</s>
            <s>Both experimental and theoretical study of these interactions is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the system and the wide range of time and length scales involved.</s>
            <s>The magnitude of these interactions differs significantly with peptide and lipid species, as well as with solution conditions.</s>
            <s>A number of methods have been successfully applied to study peptide-lipid interactions 1 .</s>
            <s>In particular, atomic force microscopy (AFM) based single-molecule force spectroscopy 2-4 can be used to quantitatively probe the strength and range of peptide-lipid membrane interactions, by measuring the detachment (last rupture) force, F, through repeated AFM retraction experiments.</s>
            <s>The standard approach to interpret the measured histogram, P(F), of the stochastic force, F, is to model the peptide-lipid membrane detachment as a diffusive escape process across a free energy barrier 5-8 .</s>
            <s>This single detachment pathway model is characterized by (i) an energy parameter (barrier height ΔU 0 ), (ii) a geometric parameter (attraction range Δx 0 ), and (iii) a kinetic parameter (intrinsic escape rate k 0 , or escape time τ 0 = 1/k 0 ).</s>

          <s>Our experiments show that, for peptide-lipid membrane detachment, k(F) depends strongly on the retraction speed and has non-monotonic behavior in F, thus implying that for such systems multiple detachment pathways are in play.</s>
          <s>The purpose of this paper is to formulate and apply a general, multi-pathway model for describing the detachment force distribution, P(F), and the corresponding k(F), of forced detachment of peptides from lipid membranes.</s>
          <s>We demonstrate the viability of the proposed model by applying it to AFM retraction experiments, performed under different experimental conditions, that involve two different peptides (of different length) and two species of lipid bilayers.</s>

          <s>We identify these pathways as final rupture events involving either one or two residues of the peptide.</s>
          <s>Indeed, due to its polymeric nature, the separation of the peptide from the membrane during retraction proceeds residue-by-residue.</s>
          <s>Right before detachment, the peptide-lipid membrane contact is restricted to a single residue, in general, located at the end of the peptide away from the AFM tip.</s>
          <s>Thus, depending on the time resolution of the AFM instrument, F extracted from the retraction force time series, corresponds to the dissociation of the last residue, or the dissociation in rapid succession of the last two (or more) residues still in contact with the membrane.</s>

          <s>Furthermore, once the kinetic parameters (k 0n ) have also been determined for a specific peptide and lipid-membrane system, by changing experimental conditions (e.g., modifying the retraction speed v, or exchanging -otherwise identically prepared -AFM tips) one only needs to tune the weights w n in order to match the experimental P(F) and k(F) with the theoretical model.</s>

          <s>Another finding is that the intrinsic (detachment-) off-rate, = =∑ = k k w k (0) n N n n 0 1 0 , of the peptide from the membrane (within reasonable numerical errors) is independent of v, in spite of the fact that the weights w n are v-dependent while k n0 are not.</s>

          <s>It should be emphasized that the PMF parameters (ΔU 0n and Δx 0n ) are determined by the nature of the peptide and lipid membrane and, thus, their values should not be changed during the fitting process.</s>

          <s>While the convergence of w n to a peptide-lipid membrane specific value may require a very large number of measurements, the parameters identifying the individual pathways (i.e., ΔU 0n , Δx 0n , and k 0n ) should be obtainable from a relatively small number of single molecule experiments.</s>

          <s>While the individual rates, k n (F), for each detachment pathway are monotonically increasing with F, the non-monotonic behavior of k(F), given by Eq. (6), is due to the F-dependent contributions [through the coefficients α n (F)] of the individual pathways.</s>

          <s>Here, individual peptide-lipid detachment events occur, with a given probability, along well defined pathways, which do not cross or convert during rupture.</s>

          <s>While the contribution of individual pathways to P(F) are force independent (w n ), the weight of the same contribution (α n ) to the effective detachment rate k(F) decreases with force because fewer attachments are still intact (see also <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref> and Eq.</s>

          <s>It appears, however, that the presence of charged lipids in the E. coli membrane leads to a considerable increase of both the rates k 0n , and the frequency of double rupture detachment events at the expense of single ruptures.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>We have used high resolution AFM-based dynamic force spectroscopy to investigate quantitatively peptide-lipid membrane interactions by measuring the detachment (last-rupture) force distribution, P(F), and the corresponding force dependent rupture rate, k(F), for two different peptides (SecA2-11 and SecA600-619) and lipid bilayers (zwitterionic POPC and charged E. coli polar membrane).</s>
          <s>The measured quantities, which differed considerably for different peptides, lipid-membranes, AFM tips (prepared under identical conditions), and retraction speeds of the AFM cantilever, could not be described in terms of the standard theory that assumes that detachment occurs along a single pathway.</s>
          <s>In particular, the prominent v-dependence of k(F) was a clear indication that peptide-lipid membrane detachment occurs stochastically along several detachment pathways.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A main result of this work is the formulation and validation of a general theoretical approach that provides a quantitative description of the detachment force distribution of a peptide from a lipid membrane.</s>
          <s>The proposed model assumes that detachment occurs, with certain probability (w n ), along a few dominant diffusive pathways, characterized by three parameters (ΔU 0n , Δx 0n , and k 0n ).</s>
          <s>We have identified these pathways with last-rupture events involving one or two residues, in general, located at the end of the peptide.</s>
          <s>The values of the energetic (ΔU 0n ) and geometric (Δx 0n ) parameters, which are residue and lipid species specific, were derived from existing free energy profile studies, while the kinetic parameters (k 0n ) and pathway weights (w n ) were used as fitting parameters.</s>
          <s>This new theoretical approach allowed for a consistent interpretation of all our experimental data.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, even for the same peptide-lipid membrane system, the occurrence frequency of different dominant detachment pathways (measured through w n ) showed significant AFM tip dependence, although these tips were prepared identically.</s>
          <s>However, even if one cannot predict the occurrence probability of a particular pathway in individual experiments, it is quite remarkable that, once the pathways have been identified and characterized, the rupture force histogram P(F) can be matched by only using w n 's as fitting parameters.</s>
          <s>Our theoretical model also reproduced accurately both retraction speed and non-monotonic force dependence of the rupture rate k(F).</s>
          <s>For moderate v and intermediate F values, k(F) exhibited catch-bond behavior, namely a decrease with increasing F, before continuing to increase again, as normally expected.</s>
          <s>According to our model, the origin of the catch-bond mechanism in peptide-lipid membrane interactions is the stochastic mixing of individual detachment pathways, which do not convert or cross during rupture.</s>
          <s>This catch-bond mechanism is manifestly different from the commonly used "two-pathway" model 24 for ligand-receptor systems.</s>
          <s>Using our theoretical model, we also calculated the intrinsic detachment (or off) rate, = ∑ = k w k (0) n N n n 1 0 , of the peptide SecA2-11 from the lipid bilayer POPC.</s>
          <s>As expected, the result was independent (within margin of errors) of the retraction speed, which is quite remarkable if we take into account that the pathway weights w n are v-dependent while the individual rates k 0n are not.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To conclude, we notice that, beside the detachment (last rupture) forces, the retraction force time series, F(t), contains detailed information about the entire peptide-lipid membrane interaction process, including intermediate rupture events.</s>
          <s>In the framework of our theoretical approach, the latter may be regarded as detachment events of intermediate residues.</s>
          <s>However, further work is needed to apply and test our theory for such intermediate rupture events.</s>
          <s>Contributions to P(F) from the n-th (n = 1, ..., 3) detachment pathways are shown as colored dashed curves; the corresponding intrinsic rupture rates, k 0n , and weights, w n , are also listed.</s>
