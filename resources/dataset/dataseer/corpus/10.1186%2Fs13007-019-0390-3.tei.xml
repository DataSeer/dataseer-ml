          <s>The technique of tissue culture plays an important role in tree breeding, and we can produce a large number of seedlings in limited space using this technique while maintaining excellent characters of the elite plants.</s>
          <s>However, high temperature and high pressure are usually necessary for sterilization during the process of tissue culture, and seedlings are apt to be polluted.</s>
          <s>So, the cost of seedling production by tissue culture technique is high.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In order to reduce the costs of the seedling production, researchers have tried to find out a new technique of tissue culture that easy to operate with low pollution rate.</s>
          <s>Herman pointed out that some plants could be cultured under the non-axenic conditions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the Herman's opinion, some researchers proposed a new tissue culture method that culture the plantlets under open conditions with an appropriate bacteriostatic agent and no need of a strict aseptic technique, and is called as open tissue culture method.</s>
          <s>During the process of open tissue culture, the bacteriostatic agent directly acts on the plantlets, which could inhibit endophytic fungi effectively than using traditional tissue culture method.</s>
          <s>Moreover, there is no need to sterilize with high temperature and high pressure and no need of an ultra-clean bench by using this method.</s>
          <s>Therefore, this method simplified the tissue culture technique, and reduces the cost of seedlings production <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>

          <s>We used three types of explants based on the results of previous studies, i.e. middle shoot section with and without leaves, and upper shoot section with leaves, and obtained suitable explant type under open conditions.</s>
          <s>Because different species and explants required different disinfection strategies, and the selection of disinfection strategy must be combined with the selection of explants.</s>
          <s>Mercuric chloride is usually used to sterilize explants, but it may cause serious injury to explants and bud induction rate might be reduced.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Using explants from adult trees for tissue culture is useful to accelerate tree breeding program and maintain good characteristics of elite tree.</s>
          <s>But bud induction of the explants from adult tree is difficult because of the maturity effect <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The composition of culture medium affects the browning of explants.</s>
          <s>Low concentration of inorganic salt is conducive to decrease browning, and high concentration of inorganic salt can increase browning <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>But there is a great variation in the response of different tree species to culture medium.</s>
          <s>For the same inorganic salt, high concentrations may lead to browning for some tree species, but may reduce browning rate for other tree species.</s>
          <s>For example, the browning rates were low when 1/2 DKW or 1/2 MS (low salt concentration) were used as culture medium in Annona <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , and Spathiphyllum kochii <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , respectively.</s>
          <s>Similarly, a high salt concentration medium inhibited browning in Ginkgo biloba <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> and Rubus fruticosus <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Here, we used a different medium for open bud induction of A. auriculiformis compared to the traditional tissue culture method.</s>
          <s>In a previous study, the best bud induction medium for A. auriculiformis was MS + 6-BA 1.</s>
        </p>
        <formula xml:id="formula_1">0 mg L −1 + sucrose 40 g L −1</formula>
        <p>
          <s>, which produced a bud induction rate of 92% <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, A. auriculiformis had high browning rates when the mediums were modified MS, 1/2 MS and 1/4 MS.</s>
          <s>No obvious changes in explants were observed at the initial stage of inoculation, but the explants were almost completely brown after culture for 10 d.</s>
          <s>The antimicrobial agent added in medium may react with certain substances in MS, which lead to the browning of explant, but it needs further studies to verify this phenomenon.</s>
          <s>Our results revealed that low nutrient contents in medium favored bud induction of A. auriculiformis under open conditions, and the suitable medium for bud induction of A. auriculiformis was 1/8 MS.</s>
          <s>Although there was no sugar in the culture medium, the explants mainly depend on the availability of light to maintain vitality and budding.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The optimum concentrations of 6-BA for bud induction under open condition were also different from those in traditional culture methods.</s>
          <s>1.5 mg L −1 6-BA was optimum concentrations for bud induction under open conditions for A. auriculiformis, which was higher than the optimum concentrations found in traditional tissue culture (1.0 mg L −1 6-BA) <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Overall, higher concentrations of 6-BA were required for bud induction of A. auriculiformis under open conditions than in traditional culture, possibly antibacterial agents in mediums affect the effectiveness of 6-BA.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the bud induction rate of explants collected in October was the highest, while it was the lowest in January when the temperature was low.</s>
          <s>These results indicated that temperature may have a significant effect on explants collection but it requires further studies.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Here, the bud induction rates of A. auriculiformis reached to 99.54% under open condition, which was higher than those obtained by traditional tissue culture (92.00%) <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The reason may be that bacteriostatic agents lowered pollution rate and raised the survival rate and the utilization ratio of explants.</s>
          <s>There were no obvious differences in germination time and growth rate of axillary bud between open tissue culture and traditional tissue culture.</s>
          <s>Axillary bud germination occurred at around 10 d, and axillary bud grew to about 2 cm after 30 d for both open tissue culture and traditional tissue culture.</s>
          <s>Therefore, open tissue culture is better than traditional tissue culture because former promotes bud induction rate.</s>

          <s>Then we cut the middle section of shoot explant (third to fifth axillary bud) with half leaves for 2-3 cm, followed by soaking into 0.8 g L −1 Carbendazim for 3 min, and then inoculated in the medium.</s>
          <s>The results showed that this pretreatment method can control pollution and have better inhibitory effect on endophytic bacteria.</s>
          <s>Only low quantity of nutrient elements was required for suitable medium, which would greatly save the costs of medium consumption, and thus reduce the costs of tissue culture.</s>
          <s>In short, by using bud induction culture under the open conditions, bud induction rate and efficiency improved significantly, and the time and material costs reduced as well.</s>

        <figDesc>. In addition, there is little known about the effective bacteriostatic agent for open tissue culture of A. auriculiformis. Bud induction is a key step in the process of tissue culture, not only for traditional tissue culture, but also for new method of tissue culture. When buds are suc- cessfully induced, they can produce reproductive mate- rial for subsequent proliferation and rooting. However, there is no easy way to induce the buds because bud induction is affected by various factors such as the types of explants, collection season, sterilization treat- ment methods, and induction culture medium. There- fore, a simple and effective bud induction technique is important for the establishment of tissue culture under open conditions. In this study, A. auriculiformis was used as a material for bud induction. We successfully established a bud induction technique for A. auriculiformis under open conditions by using different types and concentrations of antimicrobial agents, explant types, disinfection methods, bud induction mediums and collection sea- sons. Our results provided an important foundation for further establishment of open tissue culture technique for A. auriculiformis. We screened out the proper bac- teriostatic agent to simplify tissue culture technique of A. auriculiformis under open conditions, which could considerably reduce the costs of tissue culture. The results are important for the breeding and application of A. auriculiformis, and would provide an important reference for other tree species.</figDesc>
