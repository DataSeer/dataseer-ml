            <s>Early in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vascular integrity is compromised.</s>
            <s>This is accompanied by a marked vascular remodeling response, though it is currently unclear whether this is an adaptive vascular repair mechanism or is part of the pathogenic process.</s>
            <s>In light of the well-described angiogenic role for the α5β1 integrin, the goal of this study was to evaluate how genetic deletion of endothelial α5 integrin (α5-EC-KO mice) impacts vascular remodeling and repair following vascular disruption during EAE pathogenesis, and how this subsequently influences clinical progression and inflammatory demyelination.</s>
            <s>Immunofluorescence staining revealed that fibronectin and α5 integrin expression were strongly upregulated on spinal cord blood vessels during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE.</s>
            <s>Interestingly, α5-EC-KO mice showed much earlier onset and faster progression of EAE, though peak disease severity and chronic disease activity were no different from wild-type mice.</s>
            <s>At the histological level, earlier disease onset in α5-EC-KO mice correlated with accelerated vascular disruption and increased leukocyte infiltration into the spinal cord.</s>
            <s>Significantly, spinal cord blood vessels in α5-EC-KO mice showed attenuated endothelial proliferation during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE which resulted in reduced vascular density at later time-points.</s>
            <s>Under pro-inflammatory conditions, primary cultures of α5KO brain endothelial cells showed reduced proliferation potential.</s>
            <s>These findings suggest that α5β1 integrin-mediated angiogenic remodeling represents an important repair mechanism that counteracts vascular disruption during the early stages of EAE development.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease of middle-age, affecting more than 400,000 people in the United States <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Pathologically, it is characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease in which myelin-forming oligodendrocytes are destroyed by auto-immune attack from auto-reactive T lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in demyelination followed by degeneration of axons within the central nervous system (CNS) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Though auto-reactive leukocytes cause the actual damage to myelin and axons, changes in vascular properties play a central role in the initiation and maintenance of this pathology <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Early in the disease process, the normal high integrity of CNS blood vessels, known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is compromised when blood vessels start to become leaky, allowing the extravasation of inflammatory leukocytes into the CNS.</s>
          <s>Within a similar time-frame, CNS blood vessels in MS patients and in an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), undergo a vigorous angiogenic remodeling response, culminating in increased blood vessel density <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Of note, while loss of BBB integrity has obvious deleterious consequences, it is still unclear whether the angiogenic remodeling that occurs early in MS is either part of an adaptive protective response designed to repair the damaged blood vessels and enhance the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the damaged area or is part of the pathogenic process, leading to the creation of leaky dysfunctional vessels.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins play an important instructive role influencing vascular formation and stability <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Some ECM proteins, such as laminin, are expressed at high levels during vascular differentiation and stabilization and play important roles in maintaining BBB integrity via their influence on endothelial expression of tight junction proteins <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Conversely, other ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, and its receptor α5β1 integrin are strongly upregulated on angiogenic blood vessels in many different organs and situations, including development, inflammation and neoplasia <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[5,</ref>

          <s>We have shown that vascular formation in the CNS is associated with a developmental switch from fibronectin-mediated pathways during developmental angiogenesis to lamininmediated pathways in the mature CNS <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to being expressed at high levels during development, α5 integrin is strongly upregulated on remodeling blood vessels in the adult brain, as seen in mouse models of ischemic stroke, chronic mild hypoxia and MS <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, transgenic mice with endothelial deletion of α5 integrin (α5-EC-KO mice) show delayed and reduced angiogenesis in the CNS in response to chronic mild hypoxia, highlighting an important angiogenic role for α5β1 integrin <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In previous work, we demonstrated that in the early (pre-symptomatic) phase of EAE, blood vessels in the brain and cervical spinal cord show strong induction of fibronectin and α5β1 integrin that is associated with endothelial proliferation and a marked angiogenic response <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>

          <s>First, is α5 integrin required for mediating the angiogenic response in EAE?</s>

          <s>While there is a clear consensus that BBB disruption has deleterious consequences by facilitating leukocyte infiltration into the CNS, what is less clear is the impact of angiogenic remodeling on disease progression.</s>
          <s>One fundamental question that has yet to be answered is what is the relationship between BBB disruption and angiogenic remodeling in MS?</s>
          <s>The commonly held view is that early in MS pathogenesis, BBB integrity is compromised when inflammatory leukocytes release proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 which digest ECM components of the vascular basement membrane as well as tight junction proteins connecting endothelial cells tightly together, to effectively punch holes in the BBB <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As endothelial proliferation and vascular remodeling occur in a similar time-frame to BBB disruption, one interpretation is that vascular remodeling is an endogenous attempt to repair the damaged blood vessels and re-establish vascular integrity.</s>
          <s>However, an alternative explanation is that the pro-inflammatory environment present during the pre-symptomatic phase of disease stimulates a dysfunctional vascular remodeling response, leading to the formation of aberrant leaky blood vessels <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The studies we present here go some way to clarifying this relationship.</s>
          <s>We report here that the absence of the pro-angiogenic α5β1 integrin largely blocked the angiogenic response normally seen in the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , and that this angiogenic blockade resulted in accelerated loss of vascular integrity, worse inflammation, and faster progression of EAE.</s>
          <s>The strong implication of these findings is that vascular remodeling is a protective repair mechanism that counteracts vascular disruption at an early stage of EAE progression, and that α5β1 integrin is part of the molecular machinery that drives this angiogenic remodeling.</s>
          <s>Of note, these findings are at odds with the work of Roscoe et al. <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[31]</ref> who showed that antibody blockade of VEGF protected against EAE development, suggesting that silencing the angiogenic response protects against EAE progression.</s>
          <s>However, it should be pointed out that in addition to blocking the growth of new blood vessels, anti-VEGF therapy would also have the beneficial effect of enhancing vascular integrity, which by itself might account for the protective effect of the anti-VEGF treatment.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The time-sensitivity of endothelial α5β1 integrin protection One interesting finding to emerge from these studies is that although α5-EC-KO mice showed much earlier clinical onset of EAE, correlating with a deficiency in the ability of endothelial cells to proliferate and repair damaged blood vessels during the early stage of disease pathogenesis, surprisingly, once mice developed EAE, peak clinical scores and the extent of chronic disease in α5-EC-KO mice were essentially no different from WT littermates.</s>
          <s>What could account for this apparent time-sensitivity?</s>
          <s>Based on our previous finding that most vascular remodeling in EAE occurs in the pre-symptomatic phase <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , it follows that this phase would be most sensitive to lack of α5β1 integrin function, and that its absence at this stage would quickly lead to obvious deficits.</s>
          <s>In keeping with this idea, because relatively less angiogenesis occurs in the later phases of disease, it stands to reason that defects may not be so apparent or are more likely to be covered by compensatory mechanisms.</s>
          <s>On this note, we previously described strong upregulation of the alternative fibronectin receptor αvβ3 integrin on brain endothelial cells in response to mild hypoxia (8% O 2 ) <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As this has the potential to compensate for loss of endothelial α5β1 integrin in promoting fibronectin-mediated cerebral angiogenesis, we also examined whether this might be happening in EAE and thus explain the lack of apparent defect in α5-EC-KO mice at later time points.</s>
          <s>However, in contrast to our studies of mild hypoxia, where αvβ3 is strongly upregulated by endothelial cells <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , in EAE tissue we saw no endothelial induction of the αvβ3 integrin at any time point examined (R.

          <s>What could explain these contrasting findings in these two different models whereby endothelial α5 integrin appears to play a protective role in EAE but a potentially harmful one in ischemic stroke?</s>
          <s>One possible explanation could center around the time-scale of these two models: ischemic stroke is an acute event resulting in massive vascular disruption and loss of integrity that occurs within minutes-hours of the triggering event <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">9]</ref> , while in contrast, EAE is a more chronic event, in which vascular disruption continues for days-weeks.</s>
          <s>Another important factor could be the severity of vascular destruction.</s>
          <s>At the heart of the ischemic core in the stroke model, most blood vessels are destroyed and endothelial cells undergo cell death, while in the EAE model, blood vessels may become temporarily leaky but they are still viable and responsive to environmental cues, sufficient enough to launch an angiogenic repair response.</s>
          <s>Based on these important differences in the timing and severity of vascular injury in ischemic stroke and EAE, we propose that in the face of severe acute ischemic injury, vascular repair mechanisms mediated by endothelial α5β1 integrin are immediately overwhelmed and can do no practical good; instead, endothelial activation promoted by α5β1 integrin actually enhances endothelial separation and vascular leak, so silencing endothelial α5β1 integrin function may be protective.</s>
          <s>In contrast, in the face of the milder, more chronic challenge posed by EAE, endothelial remodeling events promoted by α5β1 integrin will facilitate vascular repair and protect against BBB disruption and neuroinflammation.</s>

        <head>Does endothelial α5β1 integrin represent a therapeutic target in MS?</head>
        <p>
          <s>Our studies show that the absence of endothelial α5 integrin in EAE leads to a defective vascular repair response, resulting in accelerated vascular disruption, exaggerated influx of inflammatory leukocytes and increased rate of demyelination.</s>
          <s>These findings suggest that factors that stimulate endothelial α5 integrin or its signaling pathways might enhance vascular repair and confer protection against neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease.</s>
          <s>In future studies we will test this idea by evaluating the protective activity of several fibronectin-derived peptides that specifically target the α5β1 integrin.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>The goal of this study was to evaluate how genetic deletion of endothelial α5 integrin affects vascular remodeling and repair following damage to the BBB during EAE pathogenesis, and how this subsequently impacts clinical progression and inflammatory demyelination.</s>
          <s>IF analysis showed that fibronectin and α5 integrin expression were strongly upregulated on spinal cord blood vessels during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, α5-EC-KO mice showed much earlier onset and faster progression of EAE, which at the histological level correlated with accelerated loss of vascular integrity and increased leukocyte infiltration into the spinal cord.</s>
          <s>Significantly, spinal cord blood vessels in α5-EC-KO mice showed attenuated endothelial proliferation during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE which resulted in reduced vascular density.</s>
          <s>Taken together, our data support the concept that α5β1 integrin-mediated angiogenic remodeling represents an important endogenous vascular repair mechanism that counteracts vascular disruption during the early stages of EAE progression.</s>
          <s>In light of the potential importance of these findings to BBB integrity, aside from MS, our work may have implications for other chronic diseases that include BBB disruption as a pathogenic component, including vascular dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</s>
