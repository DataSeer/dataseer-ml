            <s>The development of positive attitudes toward science is one of the main priorities in science education.</s>
            <s>However, there is a lack of reliable and valid instruments to measure Spanishspeaking elementary students' attitudes towards school science.</s>
            <s>In this study, the translation and validation of the Spanish School-Science Attitude Survey (S-SSAS) is reported.</s>
            <s>The instrument was administered to 643 students enrolled in 3 rd to 6 th elementary grades.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Psychometric evaluation of the S-SSAS provided sound evidence for validity (face, content, construct and criterion) and reliability (internal consistency and temporal stability).</s>
            <s>Content validity was confirmed through a panel of experts who reached great consensus in linking items to attitudinal constructs, with an ICC = .956.</s>
            <s>Think-aloud interviews confirmed that students have easily understood and correctly interpreted all items included, thus providing face validity for the S-SSAS.</s>
            <s>Consistent with theoretical expectations, predictive validity ranged between -.334 to 543 and concurrent validity was examined through S-SSAS correlation with two external measures of conceptual convergence that ranged from.301 to .560,</s>
            <s>thus confirming criterion validity.</s>
            <s>Construct validity was assessed by obtaining consistent results with the original scale in terms of reporting no statistically significant differences in attitudinal profiles towards school science between girls and boys and between students from urban and rural schools.</s>
            <s>Cronbach αfor the entire scale was .704,</s>
            <s>with item-total correlation ranging from .243 to .560, which reports acceptable internal consistency.</s>

            <s>and r = .464-790.</s>
            <s>Taken together, these results indicate that the Spanish single-items School-Science Attitude Survey is easy to administer and equally interpreted by both girls and boys enrolled in rural and urban elementary schools, thus being a valid and reliable instrument for measuring attitudes towards school science.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In the last decade, there have been significant changes in science education post-compulsory courses enrolments, with a steady decline in students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>

          <s>To date, attempts to measure attitudes have mainly focused on the administration of Likert-type scales that not always reported adequate psychometric properties and that often were too extensive to be implemented at elementary education stage.</s>
          <s>For example, the instruments with the strongest psychometric properties from Blalock et al. review <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> were validated with secondary school students <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> and posed administration problems due to their length <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, there are few newer instruments to measure attitudes toward science specifically developed and validated for elementary education: the 30-item BRAINS instruments <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , the 28-item Three-Dimension Elementary Science Attitude Survey <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , the 28-items attitude toward STEM instrument <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> or the 30-item Attitudes toward Science Class instrument <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, some of these scales are focused on the measurement of attitudes towards science in general and are still to extensive, especially for longitudinal studies where educational interventions intended to improve attitudes are the main focus and therefore multiple data collection are needed <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This problem is further accentuated for scales in Spanish, with a great absence in the literature of validated scales for elementary stages.</s>
          <s>For example, some studies <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> have used extensive questionnaires in Spanish in both elementary and secondary schools, however, authors did not report on their psychometric properties.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, although Navarro, Förster, González, &amp; González-Pose <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> have validated Fraser's TOSRA scale <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20]</ref> for Spanish-speaking students, the questionnaire is made up of a total of 70 Likert-type items, is focused on measuring attitudes towards science in general, and has also been validated only with students in higher grades than the Primary Education stage.</s>
          <s>Therefore, there is a need for valid and reliable quantitative instruments of easy and quick administration that facilitates the study of students' attitudes toward school science at this stage.</s>
          <s>Consequently, the aim of this paper is to study the translation and validation of the Spanish single item instrument proposed by Kennedy, Quinn, &amp; Taylor <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> called School Science Attitude Survey (SSAS).</s>
          <s>Considering the potential usefulness of brief measures of attitude toward school science, this study aims to provide sound evidence for the translation procedure used (face &amp; content validity), for construct and criterion validity, and for internal consistency, sensitivity and temporal stability reliability.</s>

        <head>Theoretical underpinning of attitudes toward science</head>

          <s>.) somewhat nebulous, often poorly articulated and not well understood" <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> p.1049, and no clear definition have been provided yet.</s>
          <s>Klopfer <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> offered insight about the concept under study by categorizing the attitude construct as a set of affective behaviors toward science as an enterprise, scientist, scientific inquiry, scientific careers and towards science-related activities in general.</s>
          <s>Gardner <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> provided further clarity by addressing the differences between «scientific attitudes», conceived as those elements inherent to scientific thinking and research, and «attitudes toward science», conceptualized as the sociological, psychological and affective conceptions and beliefs about science.</s>
          <s>Research developed at elementary level reported the existence of many sub-constructs underlying the attitudes toward science construct, including (i) students affective feelings and cognitive judgments of science <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , (ii) unfavorable outlook of science <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> and (iii) perception of scientists and value of science to society <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> , among many others.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recent results of past research indicating that, in general, students tend to have positive attitudes toward science but negative attitudes toward school science, stressed the need of advancing research about factors affecting students' intentions and likehood of enrolling in science related activities and careers.</s>
          <s>Therefore, there is a shift from focusing on attitudes toward science in general, to focusing on attitudes toward school science, which may be a better predictor of student's behavior than attitudes toward science in general <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, recent studies adopted various psychological theories like the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> or the Expectancy-value theory (EVT) <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>

          <s>Thus, attitudes are being studied by examining students enjoyment, self-efficacy, perceived difficulty <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> and others behavioral beliefs about the consequences of engaging in science <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>

          <s>Research on attitudes towards science has been dealing with methodological issues caused by a lack of rigor in the development and use of attitude measurement instruments.</s>
          <s>Munby <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> first concluded that authors do not take the necessary steps to develop valid and reliable attitude toward science instruments.</s>
          <s>Thus, for example, the presence of discrepant and contradictory results is very common in attitude toward science research and may be explained by the lack of psychometrically robust instruments <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In more recent years, Blalock et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> underlined these issues by concluding that the vast majority of attitude instruments used in science education research the area of scientific education are lacking in terms of validity and reliability psychometric properties evidences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Attitude toward science research conducted in Spain is no stranger to this problem.</s>
          <s>The most relevant attitude studies in Spain have used questionnaires that have not been subjected to reliability and validity tests and therefore, the extent to which the results reported in these studies are valid and reliable remains unclear <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">(Table 1)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These studies have mainly used the ROSE instrument and the PANA questionnaire.</s>
          <s>In relation to the ROSE instrument, it is an adaptation of the Schreiner &amp; Sjøberg <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> scale, originally developed in English and subsequently translated into several languages, including Spanish.</s>
          <s>The PANA questionnaire has been specifically designed by the authors.</s>
          <s>In both cases, the lack of validity, reliability and resistivity evidences is worryingly absent.</s>
          <s>None of the studies using the PANA questionnaire have provided information on their psychometric properties, and only one study of the six included in the <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> using the ROSE questionnaire provided information on the validity and reliability of the instrument, albeit with clear methodological problems.</s>
          <s>For example, Vázquez-Alonso &amp; Manassero-Mas <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> have submitted the ROSE questionnaire to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), obtaining cross loadings on three items.</s>
          <s>Instead of eliminating these items and redoing the factor analysis, the authors decided to keep the items, which is clearly a methodologically inadequate practice <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In short, these results demonstrate the need to develop psychometrically valid instruments, especially for the Spanish context.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The SSAS <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> is a web-based visual-analogue scale designed to examine student's attitudinal profile (AP) to the area of school science through ten items that addresses the six common attitudinal constructs (AC) used in the literature of attitudes toward science <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref> .From an initial pool of 46 items based on existing instruments and 22 newly developed, authors selected those that best represented each construct based on interviews with target sample, internal constancy results, and four dimensionality tests.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Four AC-intentions for future enrolment (I), enjoyableness (E), difficulty (D) and self-efficacy in school science(S)-were unidimensional and the remaining two AC-usefulness (U) and relevance of school science (R)-were found to be multidimensional.More specifically, The SSAS was selected for its translation and validation for Spanish speaking students for several reasons.</s>
          <s>Firstly, because it is consistent with recent recommendations on measuring attitudes toward the school science subjectinstead of science in general.</s>
          <s>In addition, it is an instrument that includes the main attitudinal constructs studied in this line of research.</s>
          <s>Finally, it is a short and easy to administer instrument, ideally for contexts in which time constraints limit the application of longer instruments, particularly in elementary education with younger students.</s>
          <s>Although SSAS uses single-items measures to examine all its constructs and sub-dimensions,which is in contrast to trends characterized by measuring a construct across multiple items, the initial validation results of the Kennedy et al. study <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> have shown that the SSAS reports robust results.</s>
          <s>Although multi-item instruments are more stable, reliable and accurate <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48]</ref> , single-item measures can be as psychometrically valid as long measures.</s>
          <s>For example, studies that have adapted extensive instruments into single-item scales have shown equally reliable and valid results as its multi-item version, such as the single item self-esteem scale <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> or the SIMP <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50]</ref> , which measures the Big Five personality with one item per construct.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The purpose of this study was to translate the single-item SSAS survey <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> for its use by elementary Spanish-speaking students and to test its validity and reliability.</s>
          <s>Through a multistage translation approach and multiple psychometric evaluations, the current study provides evidence that the S-SSAS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring elementary students' attitudes toward school science.</s>
          <s>Regarding translation validity, the Think-Aloud structured interviews indicated that the S-SSAS is easily understood and interpreted by Spanish students in 3 rd to 6 th grades of Elementary Education.</s>
          <s>Additionally, the panel of experts shared acceptable agreement in the assignments of items to each attitudinal construct.</s>
          <s>These results provide face and content validity for the scale.</s>
          <s>Psychometric evaluation of the S-SSAS indicated an adequate level of internal consistency reliability and that response were well distributed along the response categories, showing great sensitivity and no evidence of extreme response tendency.</s>
          <s>Intraclass correlation coefficient supported the temporal stability reliability of the translated SSAS, with a 10-days span between first and second administration.</s>
          <s>Pearson correlation coefficient reported acceptable predictive validity with strong correlation between expected attitudinal constructs based on results reported in specialized literature of attitudes, and also great concurrent validity, thus obtaining high correlation between the attitudinal constructs of the S-SSAS scale and two attitudes measures of conceptual convergence already validated in the literature.</s>
          <s>In addition, discriminative validity between S-SSAS constructs was confirmed and parametric and non-parametric tests indicated that the translated version of the SSAS replicates similar results to those of its original version in terms of sex and rural or urban school variables, thus confirming discriminative validity and further supporting the applicability of the S-SSAS.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One main limitation should be acknowledged.</s>
          <s>The concurrent validity was assessed using two other scales that weren't previously validated for Spanish-speaking students.</s>
          <s>Ideally, S-SSAS results should have been correlated with other Spanish scales in order to obtain more reliable results.</s>
          <s>However, given the absence of validated Spanish scales for elementary education, we were forced to use two scales that were validated in another language.</s>
          <s>To counter this limitation, both Abd-El-Khalick et al. <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> and Sabah et al. <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[60]</ref> scales were translated into Spanish using the same multistage translation approach as for the S-SSAS.</s>
          <s>Future studies should consider subscales from the Spanish version of the TOSRA <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> to further examine the concurrent validity of the S-SSAS.</s>
          <s>Although the Navarro et al.'s <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> TOSRA was validated with high school students, it's psychometric properties for Spanish speaking students are more likely to be stronger than those of the instruments used in this study.</s>
          <s>In addition, future studies should administer the original and the Spanish SSAS to a bilingual sample and compute equivalence tests between both scores, thus further examining the S-SSAS applicability.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Taken together, in can be concluded that the Spanish SSAS represents a first effort to provide a valid and reliable measure to examine attitudes toward school science of Spanish-speaking elementary students, especially when there are time constraints for data collection.</s>
          <s>This instrument is easy to administer and quick to answer because it consists of only ten singleitem measures equally interpretable by both girls and boys from rural and urban schools.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it can be useful in quasi-experimental time-series designs where several data measurement is needed.</s>
