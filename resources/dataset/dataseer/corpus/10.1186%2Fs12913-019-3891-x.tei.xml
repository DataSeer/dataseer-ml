          <s>Many empirically supported interventions (ESIs) are neither adopted nor successfully implemented in practice <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, the ones that do succeed to 'bridge the gap' , take many years to do so <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6]</ref> , but then still the complex interplay of determinants and stakeholders is not yet understood.</s>
          <s>It has been established that SelfManagement of Well-being (SMW) interventions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> improve self-management ability and well-being, and reduce loneliness in older adults <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When adopted and implemented in health and social care settings, the SMW interventions may have the potential to constrain the accumulating prevalence of social isolation <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , depression <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , and inactivity <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> in older adults.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the implementation of the SMW group intervention in health and social care, with special focus on the pace of this process and the dependency between individual and organizational determinants in this process.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is known that new interventions often take long to be implemented in practice, even though time effectiveness has been identified as a priority <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Reasons to transit from adoption to implementation in 'a relatively quick manner' is important, because one-third of the newly learned competencies in professionals will be lost after one year <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, organizations perceive implementation as a return on their investment in having professionals trained.</s>
          <s>This return diminishes when professionals fail to attain first use of a new intervention <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The rule of thumb is that it takes between two and six months to attain first use <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since the pace of implementation of the SMW group intervention is not yet known, it is subject of investigation in this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is known that a wide array of facilitating and impeding factors affect implementation.</s>
          <s>Literature reviews produce comprehensive lists, ranging from 23 up to 50 factors <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[20]</ref>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Some also acknowledging that different factors operate at different stakeholder levels, such as professionals, organizations, and financial-political contexts <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, not many studies take the interdependencies between these stakeholders into account when investigating factors affecting implementation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although many implementation models exist that distinguish various stakeholder levels <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[24]</ref> , to our knowledge, hardly any models exist that provide clear directions how to empirically investigate determinants of the implementation process.</s>
          <s>An exception is the Fleuren framework, which provides detailed descriptions to determine which stakeholder's factors are important at what stage of the implementation process <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>First, the Fleuren framework distinguishes four stages: orientation, adoption, implementation and continuation <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The transition from adoption to implementation has been recognized to be the most challenging <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Professionals have to become proficient in applying new just acquired skills, and organizations have to be or become efficient in allocating time and resources to the new way of doing things <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the focus of this study is on exactly this stage in the implementation process, i.e. the stage where professionals and their organization transit from adoption to first use of the SMW intervention.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Second, the Fleuren framework identifies determinants of implementation on both the professional and organizational level.</s>
          <s>It is very important to realize that professional and organization levels are not independent <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Proficient professionals might not start using a new intervention if there are organizational barriers.</s>
          <s>Vice versa, a facilitating organization will not start using a new intervention when there are professional barriers.</s>
          <s>Therefore, this study will not only investigate which determinants play a role on either the professional or the organizational level when implementing the SMW group intervention, but also which factors remain determinants when taking the nested structure of professionals in their organizations into account.</s>

        <head>Adaptation Fleuren framework to fit the SMW implementation study</head>

          <s>However, we needed to adapt this general framework for the study at hand, i.e., for the case of the SMW intervention, because not all levels and determinants fitted our study.</s>
          <s>For example, we removed the originally defined level of the innovation and attributed its factors (e.g.</s>
          <s>'clearness procedures' and 'appealing to use') to the individual professional level, because these factors would need to be assessed by the professionals that execute the SMW intervention (innovation).</s>
          <s>Additionally, we renamed some levels and factors.</s>
          <s>For example, 'users' in the Fleuren framework we referred to as the 'professionals' , and 'patients' were 'clients' in the current study.</s>
          <s>This adaptation process of the Fleuren implementation framework is described in detail elsewhere <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The resulting implementation framework for the current study identifies four stages of implementation and 35 determinants on the professional and the organizational level (see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>On the professional level, 15 factors were sorted into three clusters: competencies, innovation and work situation.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This study showed that two out of three trained professionals achieved first use of the SMW group intervention in about eight months.</s>
          <s>Four determinants of using the SMW intervention were identified on the professional level.</s>
          <s>When the nested structure of professionals within organizations was taken into account, compatibility on the professional level, remained the only significant determinant of first use on the professional level, confirming the importance of organizational dependency.</s>
          <s>Organizational size and managerial innovation-task orientation fit were factors on the organizational level that determined first use of the SMW group intervention.</s>
          <s>To our knowledge not many implementation studies report utilization rate and pace of implementation.</s>
          <s>However, the utilization-rate of 67% found in the current study is similar to another community-based intervention; the rate in this Positive Parenting Program (TripleP) was 63 * p -values &lt; .05 were significant SMW Self-management of Well-being <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">Table 3</ref> Factors on the organizational level (n = 18) affecting mean first user ratio and 70% <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The mean pace at which SMW professionals realized first use of the SMW group intervention was 7.5 months.</s>
          <s>This is a little bit slower than the 2-6 months, as indicated by <ref type="bibr">Fixsen et al., 2007 [18]</ref> , but much quicker than the start-up time reported in other studies.</s>
          <s>Implementation of a Colorectal Cancer Screening Demonstration program took 9-11 months to start-up <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Implementation of AHA guidelines took 13 months <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[36]</ref> , while implementation of a software program in laboratories took 1.8 years <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although, the above mentioned implemented interventions are different in nature, it seems that the utilization rate and the pace of implementation of the SMW group intervention in health and social care is quicker.</s>
          <s>So overall, the pace of implementation of the SMW group intervention was successful.</s>
          <s>Four determinants of first use could be identified on the professional level when the dependency of organizations was ignored.</s>
          <s>The chance of a professional realizing first use of the SMW group intervention seemed to be determined by the extent to which she perceives 'ownership' , 'relative advantage' , 'support' and/or 'compatibility'.</s>
          <s>However, when the nested structure of professionals in organizations was taken into account, results showed that professionals' perceived 'compatibility' was the only remaining significant key determinant.</s>
          <s>This means that independently of the organization in which professionals work, compatibility is an important factor of professionals that determines use of the SMW intervention.</s>
          <s>Compatibility seems an important facilitating factor for implementation, as confirmed by other studies.</s>
          <s>For example, it was found that the innovation needs to fit the work and routines of healthcare professionals <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[38]</ref> and Van der Stege <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[39]</ref> found that incompatibility of own goals with intervention goals was a barrier of implementation.</s>
          <s>'Ownership' , 'relative advantage' and 'support perceived by the professional' were no longer significant determinants of SMW intervention first use, when the dependency of the organization was taken into account.</s>
          <s>This means that the organization, in which the professionals work, has a stronger influence on whether or not the SMW intervention will be used than these three determinants on the professional level.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our results showed that 'organizational size' and 'managerial innovation-task orientation fit' were determinants of mean first user ratio on the organizational level.</s>
          <s>However, we didn't find any significant organizational determinants of first use of the SMW group intervention on the professional level.</s>
          <s>Regarding this finding, it should be noted that first use on the professional level and mean first user ratio, are different outcome measures, with the latter being a collective measure.</s>
          <s>It remains speculative why larger organizations realized use of the SMW intervention more often than smaller organizations, but it could be that, for example, the availability of a PR department in larger organizations might be a facilitating factor.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the finding that 'managerial innovationtask orientation fit' was also a significant determinant, indicates that compatibility of the SMW intervention with current tasks was important for both professionals and managers to start using the SMW intervention.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The strengths of this study are that it is an observational study in health and social care settings that applies both a predefined implementation framework and a multilevel approach to identify determinants of successful implementation of a new evidence-based intervention.</s>
          <s>Though the use of frameworks in implementation sciences has significantly increased over the past decades <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">40]</ref> , the use of multilevel analysis techniques has primarily been confined to health care professionals' behavior or behavioral intentions to use information technology <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[41,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">42]</ref> or research utilization in general <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[43,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">44]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To our knowledge, multi-level analyses investigating modelbased determinants of implementation in health and social care settings are scarce (for an exception see: <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[45]</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite these strengths some limitations should be noted.</s>
          <s>First, the sample size was a limitation.</s>
          <s>Even though we had more than 10 groups as recommended for multilevel logistic regression analysis <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[32]</ref> , our sample was too small for multivariate testing in the multilevel model.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the large odds ratio and wide 95% confidence interval of the multilevel analysis could be attributed to the small sample size as well, and therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we may have missed some significant single level determinants, because of the small sample size.</s>
          <s>For example, 'self-efficacy' , a well-known factor on the professional level from other studies <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">46]</ref> , might also have proven to be significant when many more professionals and organizations had participated in the project.</s>
          <s>Although we succeeded to engage more organizations and professionals than planned, implementation research is typically beset by a "small N" problem <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Second, although we assessed determinants on the level of the professional and the organization, other contextual factors could be important too.</s>
          <s>According to the original model of <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">Fleuren et al. (2004)</ref> factors on the level of the financial political context, such as rules and legislation, and financial resources, are relevant too <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our larger project <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , we did consider these factors, but due to the restricted scope of the project, we were not able to get sufficient and valid data on these factors.</s>
          <s>Additionally, it should be noted that this study was performed in four provinces in the Northern part of the Netherlands, so our results might not apply to other regions in the Netherlands, nor to other countries.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Third, the items to measure the potential determinants based on the Fleuren framework <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21]</ref> have been self-constructed and have not yet been validated.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is unknown whether the factors are measured reliably and validly.</s>
          <s>In the meantime, <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">Fleuren et al. (2014)</ref> have developed the MIDI-instrument <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[47]</ref> , but this instrument was not available by the time we had to assess the factors.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the MIDI instrument also needs validation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Fourth, a control group could have been of added value to the design.</s>
          <s>An ideal design would have included organizations with similar baseline characteristics that did not adopt the SMW intervention.</s>
          <s>However in practice, this would be very hard to realize.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Furthermore, one could reason that the level of implementation might be overestimated, because it has been shown that implementation can deteriorate over time <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , and we assessed use early in the project, two years after the start of the project.</s>
          <s>However, we don't expect that the level of implementation was overestimated, because some of the professionals were trained relatively late in the project and had relatively limited time to start using the SMW intervention.</s>
          <s>To get a full understanding of the process of implementation of innovations in health and social care, it is needed to collect data over multiple time points <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite these limitations, this study offers useful directions for implementation practice.</s>
          <s>Given the outcome that, regardless of organizational size and culture, compatibility with other designated tasks on the individual professional level is the key determinant in the first toilsome stage from adoption to initial implementation, it is important that managers create an environment that professionals perceive as encouraging for implementation <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[48]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As also advised by Van der Kleij et al. <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[49]</ref> , emphasis should be placed on limiting the number of prescribed activities and allocating sufficient time to get experienced with the innovation.</s>
          <s>Therefore we recommend for clinical practice, that managers and administrators of adopting organizations should not only properly reserve formal and operational time for intended users, but also fine-tune allocated time with professionals during the process.</s>
          <s>Finetuning should not only encompass telling the professional what they can start doing new, but also telling them what they can stop doing the conservative way.</s>
