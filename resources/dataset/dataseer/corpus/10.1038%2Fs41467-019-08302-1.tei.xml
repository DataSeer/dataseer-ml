            <s>DNA replication timing is known to facilitate the establishment of the epigenome, however, the intimate connection between replication timing and changes to the genome and epigenome in cancer remain largely uncharacterised.</s>
            <s>Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing.</s>
            <s>A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins.</s>
            <s>Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin.</s>
            <s>Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and earlyreplication to trans chromosomal rearrangements.</s>
            <s>Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci.</s>

          <s>The major focus of this study was to address whether there are replication timing differences in cancer and if so, to investigate what was the association between replication timing and alterations to the cancer epigenome and genome.</s>
          <s>Here, we make the noteworthy discovery that replication timing and the opposing remodelling of the epigenome, in early vs. late replication, is associated with the mode of chromosomal rearrangements in cancer.</s>
          <s>We demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo longrange epigenetic deregulation in cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing.</s>
          <s>Notably, late-replicating regions in prostate and breast cancer cells display a remarkable reduction of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin.</s>
          <s>Our data support a model where alterations in epigenetic remodelling in cancer cells in early and late replicating loci provide increased probability for cis or trans chromosomal rearrangements based on the nuclear spatial context.</s>

          <s>Therefore, it was interesting to find that the replication timing profiles between different cancer cell types are more similar to each other than to non-cancer cells, suggesting that there may be shared domains that commonly display alterations in replication timing in tumourigenesis.</s>
          <s>These shared domains may have potential functional relevance to cancer, as we find enrichment of genes involved in cancer-related pathways, such as cell-to-cell adhesion and immunological signatures, and also enrichment in genes with lincRNA status raising the possibility of important regulatory functions that are potentially altered in cancer <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">36</ref> .</s>

          <s>We find transcriptional and epigenetic alterations within altered replication timing regions between normal and cancer cells.</s>
          <s>We further find that domains of replication timing alterations in prostate cancer cells correlate with previously observed domains of long-range transcriptional and epigenetic remodelling for both LRES <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">18</ref> and LREA <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">17</ref> regions, whereby earlier domains become more active and later domains become more repressive.</s>
          <s>This directional relationship between replication timing and gene expression has been observed in development and differentiation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11,</ref>

            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example in human cell lines, Rivera-Mulia et al. <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> report that developmental shifts to later timing precedes transcriptional down-regulation and developmental shifts to earlier timing follows transcriptional upregulation for the majority of replication timing switching genes, suggesting that replication timing may be both a driver and a passenger of transcription.</s>
          <s>In our study, we find that later replicating genes are primarily down-regulated, and show cancerrelated gene ontology.</s>
          <s>We therefore speculate that a change to later timing in tumourigenesis potentially precedes downregulation of these cancer-associated genes.</s>
          <s>Whilst previous studies <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">37,</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">38</ref> have shown that replication timing can impose particular chromatin states, more work is required to establish whether epigenetic changes come first and are prior too or occur as a result of a change in replication timing in cancer.</s>

        <p>
          <s>There has been no integrative study between replication timing and epigenomic changes in normal and cancer cells in the same cell system.</s>

          <s>Here, using an integrative approach we now identify that the most widespread combinatorial epigenomic alteration between normal and prostate cancer cells is DNA hypomethylation, accompanied with a switch from H3K9me3-constitutive to H3K27me3-facultative heterochromatin within lamina-bound late-replicating regions.</s>
          <s>H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are generally antagonistic and commonly switch in cancer cells <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">40</ref> and DNA hypomethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to redistribution of H3K27me3 <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">41</ref> , suggesting a direct relationship between loss of DNA methylation and gain of H3K27me3.</s>
          <s>H3K9me3 loss may also directly contribute to DNA hypomethylation, as H3K9me3 is required to enhance the activity of UHRF1 and consequently DNMT1 <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">42,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">43</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Finally, we observe an association between chromosomal rearrangements and replication timing, with late-replicating regions prone to cis rearrangements and early-regions to trans rearrangements in both breast and prostate cancer.</s>

          <s>Of note, Morganella et al. <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">46</ref> identified all breast cancer rearrangements to be associated with early replication timing, whereas, De et al. <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> identified that large deletions are enriched for late replication while large amplifications are enriched for early replication.</s>
          <s>These reports are in contrast to our study where we find a clear bias towards late replication for most rearrangements other than translocations.</s>

          <s>Our combinatorial epigenome and replication timing data leads us to propose a model to explain how replication timing status and associated epigenetic alterations may influence the nature of chromosomal cancer rearrangements <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hypomethylation and loss of H3K9 methyltransferases have been separately linked to increased genomic instability in cancer <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, our data shows that late-replicating loci in cancer are both hypomethylated and switched from a H3K9me3-marked constitutive heterochromatin state to a H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin state.</s>
          <s>We suggest that it is the combination of epigenetic remodelling in the context of the replication timing state that is associated with increased chromosomal rearrangements.</s>
          <s>In particular, we hypothesise that the switch to facultative heterochromatin may sensitise late-replicating regions to DNA damage and/or error-prone repair.</s>
          <s>Previous 3D studies suggest that the chance of a translocation occurring is proportional to the degree of chromatin interaction between two loci and interactions occur more frequently between loci within the same chromosome territory or between adjacent territories than between distant territories <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[49]</ref>

          <s>We therefore propose that bias towards cis or trans chromosomal rearrangement is related to the spatial and temporal positioning of earlyreplicating compared to late-replicating loci.</s>
          <s>As late-replicating loci are more self-contained <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">52</ref> , we suggest that DNA breaks are more likely to involve cis rearrangements.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Our model is also supported by studies that show copy number aberration breakpoints generally have the same replication timing and interact long-range 1 , and that translocation partners are required to be within the same spatial area, transcription <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">54</ref> or replication factory <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">55</ref> , before translocation can occur.</s>
          <s>A pertinent example for prostate cancer is the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion that occurs in~50-80% of all prostate cancer <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">56</ref> .</s>
          <s>Studies show that nuclear spatial proximity between TMPRSS2 and ERG is a determining factor of fusion frequency <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">57</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, spatial proximity can be induced through activation of the genes by the androgen receptor (AR) under testosterone (DHT) treatment, which works to increase spatial proximity by targeting TMPRSS2 and ERG to the same replication factory <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">55,</ref>
            <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">57</ref> .</s>

For both PrEC and LNCaP, LADs containing both lamin A/C and B1 are later than lamin A/C-only LADs (asterisk, p &lt; 2.2e −16) and lamin B1-only LADs (asterisk, p &lt; 2.2e−16). One-tailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests were performed for the alternative that LADs containing both lamin A/C and B1 is 'less'. Plots show an average line with width of shading indicating confidence intervals. b Heatmap of PrEC and LNCaP WA values over the boundary of PrEC LADs, ordered by degree of LAD extension (upstream of 5′ and downstream of 3′) and contraction (between 5′ and 3′) in LNCaP. The LADs used here contain both lamin A/C and lamin B1. Black lines down the centre of heatmaps represent PrEC LAD boundaries. White lines indicate the LAD boundary in LNCaP. Scale for WA is from late (red) to early (blue). Extension of the LAD boundary in LNCaP (upstream of PrEC 5′ and downstream of PrEC 3′) corresponds to these regions being significantly later replicating in LNCaP than PrEC (p &lt; 2.2e−16, one-tailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). Reciprocally, contraction of the LAD boundary in LNCaP (downstream of PrEC 5′ and upstream of PrEC 3′) corresponds to these regions being significantly earlier replicating in LNCaP than PrEC (p &lt; 2.2e−16, one-tailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). c Representative example of a late-replicating region in LNCaP showing maintained LADs with coordinate DNA hypomethylation, H3K27me3 gain and H3K9me3 loss (Rank 1, Supplementary Figure 8b). Scale bar represents 1 Mb. d Representative example of a late-replicating region in LNCaP showing coordinate LAD gain, DNA hypomethylation and H3K27me3 gain (Rank 3, Supplementary Figure 8b). Scale bar represents 1 Mb. e The average replication time of each LREA or LRES region is compared to a distribution of 1000 randomised LREA or LRES regions (boxplot). The significance of difference in WA distributions between regions and random is indicated (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). f, g Representative examples of overlaps between LRES and LREA, and domains of replication timing (earlier, later).

        <figDesc>Fig. 5 Conservation of replication timing alterations in cancer. WA values of all publically available Repli-Seq datasets, including PrEC and LNCaP, are assessed using PCA (a) and hierarchical clustering (Ward's criterion) (b). All clusters have a clusterwise Jaccard bootstrap mean above 0.8 indicating their stability; means are 0.9399 (cluster 1), 0.8676 (cluster 2) and 0.8225 (cluster 3). Samples are identifiable by colour and number key. c Shown are representative examples of loci that are earlier cancer domains (ECDs) or later cancer domains (LCD) in multiple cancers compared to other cell types. Shaded boxes indicate ECDs or LCDs with logFC ≥ 1. Scale bar represents 1 Mb</figDesc>

ARTICLE 

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:416 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08302-1 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications data shows that cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation occurs 
preferentially in early-replication at CpG-islands and hypomethy-
lation in late-replication at intergenic regions. 

Alterations in replication timing modulate gene expression. 
We next investigated if alterations in replication timing in cancer 
are associated with gene expression. Using the definition of 
|ΔWA| &gt; 25, we find that more genes are replicating later (515) 
than genes that are replicating earlier (169) in LNCaP compared 
to PrEC </table>
