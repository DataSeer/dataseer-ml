        <p>
          <s>Oral cancer is one of 27 types of cancers in the world, with 263 new cases of oral cancer and 127 deaths per 100,000 in 2008 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Thailand, oral cancer incidence was 8.8 cases per 100,000 between 2007 and 2009.</s>
          <s>It mainly occurred in males and the average age of individuals diagnosed with oral cancer was 66.25 years <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2012, oral cancer prevalence was deemed the 6 th most common cancer in Thailand with an incidence rate of 188 per 100,000 population <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on this same rate, there would be approximately 5,700 new cases in 2015 <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The cause of oral cancer is not exactly clear.</s>
          <s>However, the major risk factors among the Thai population include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing.</s>
          <s>Smokers had a 1.8-fold (95% CI = 0.99 to 3.35) increased risk relative to those who had never smoked.</s>
          <s>Alcohol drinkers and betel quid chewers were 2.1 (95% CI = 1.19 to 3.68) and 4.1 (95% CI = 12.16 to 7.78) times more likely to develop oral cancer compared with those who were unexposed, respectively <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Overall, the median survival time of oral cancer in Thailand ranged between 0.07 and 2 years depending on the stage they were diagnosed at <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

          <s>Treatment in the early stages, especially in oral precancerous or Potentially Malignant Disorder (PMD), has a great chance of being cured.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, untreated PMD can progress to oral cancer stage I, with the average time of 5.2 years after PMD diagnosis <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Visual inspection and palpation of oral mucosa under normal light by dentists or oral medicine specialists are widely used for PMD and oral cancer detection due to its ease of use and high accuracy <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Sensitivity and specificity of the detection are about 40-93% and 50-99%, respectively <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>

          <s>Early detection and diagnosis of PMD and oral cancer can improve a patient's survival and quality of life.</s>
          <s>However, more than 80% of patients in Thailand were being diagnosed at the advanced stage <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Currently, there is no national oral cancer screening program in Thailand.</s>
          <s>Hence, the Bureau of Dental Health, Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health had designed a pilot sudy of oral precancer screening program properly to the Thai context; health-seeking behaviors, human resources, and budget.</s>
          <s>This pilot study was conducted in a rural area of Roi-Et province, Thailand aiming at assessing the accessibility and effectiveness of oral precancer screening program.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, to consider the implementation of the oral cancer screening program, evidence of economic value is necessary.</s>
          <s>Therefore, this study was conducted at the request of policymakers along with the pilot study to assess the cost-utility of an oral cancer screening program compared to a no-screening program and to identify the design of the screening program that is most appropriate for Thailand regarding costeffectiveness.</s>

          <s>Microsoft Excel 2016 was used to run the model with country-specific epidemiology, clinical parameters, and costs.</s>
          <s>Results were presented in terms of costs, Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) by using the societal perspective-including both direct medical costs (i.e.</s>

          <s>Disease progression was identical for both the treatment and non-treatment groups, developing from no cancer to precancer and to oral cancer stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively.</s>
          <s>The modeled cohorts started at 40 years old from the no cancer state, and next cycle people will move to the pre-cancer stage with distribution based upon the oral cancer incidence in Thailand and adjusted by the probability of oral precancer from the literature review <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>

          <s>After that, people in the cohort transited among cancer states based on transitional disease probability and were followed until they reached 100 years old or successfully moved to the death state.</s>
          <s>The base-case program (scenario A) contains four main steps starting from Mouth Self-Examination (MSE), Visual Examination by Trained Dental Nurses (VETDN), Visual Examination by Trained Dentists (VETDT), and Visual Examination by Oral Surgeons (VEOS).</s>
          <s>In the MSE, the population aged over 40 years will receive documents educating on how to screen for oral lesions by themselves and questionnaires asking about their risk factors such as oral lesions, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing.</s>
          <s>Community health volunteers will distribute and collect the questionnaires at home.</s>
          <s>If people have checked that they found an oral lesion and had more than two risk factors in the step of MSE, this high-risk population will be referred to VETDN at primary care.</s>
          <s>People with a true positive and false positive results from VETDN will be screened through the next steps including VETDT at secondary, and VEOS at tertiary cares, respectively.</s>
          <s>However, each health state has a different final diagnostic confirmation-no cancer stage has identified by VETDT whereas pre-cancer stage has defined by VEOS.</s>
          <s>Oral surgeons will confirm people with true and false positive from VETDT and continue to the biopsy procedure for both the screening and the no-screening programs in order to confirm cancer diagnosis before getting into treatment.</s>
          <s>While others with true and false negative at every step of all screenings, they will remain the same health state during the cycle and they will be screened at MSE of again every year.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The screening program for oral precancer detection in Thailand seems to be cost-ineffective.</s>
          <s>Four steps are contributing to the screening program, and this leads to several major implications on program costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness.</s>
          <s>First, the study shows that program compliance is the most important factor affecting the value for money of the screening program, which is related to a literature underlines the significance of screening acceptability is one of the key elements of quality assurance for every screening program <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The compliance rates of the screening program were obviously high due to strong response of the health workers in the setting to encourage people to screen at each step.</s>
          <s>Therefore, when the program is implemented nationwide, the compliance rates should be considered to remain stable at a high level by learning success from the pilot.</s>
          <s>Otherwise, the screening program might not be cost-effective as the data show in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig 4.</ref> Second, the study indicates that two of the screening steps for early health state, i.e.</s>
          <s>MSE and VETDN, have relatively low screening accuracy which resulted in high cost and low QALYs gained.</s>
          <s>The screening program can be cost-effective if the sensitivity of MSE is improved from 20% to 60% and the specificity of MSE remains not less than 60%.</s>
          <s>In addition, the program will be cost-effective if the sensitivity and specificity of VETDN are improved from 44% and 79%, respectively, to 90% for both measures.</s>
          <s>Although, it may be possible that the development of better supporting tool and better trained community health volunteers who educate the target population for self-screening could improve the sensitivity of MSE to the preferable level, it is very unlikely that sensitivity and specificity of VETDN can enhance to 90% given the current performance of VETDT.</s>
          <s>As a result, this study estimated that if the low accuracy screening steps, i.e.</s>
          <s>MSE and VETDN, are removed from the program without compromising accessibility to screening by dentists among the target population, the screening program is also a preferable choice in terms of program effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The study indicates that the Scenario D, which includes MSE, VETDT, and VEOS, is considered the most feasible and practical choice under the Thai context because Thailand has a severe shortage of dentists (with 4,647 active dentists) at the public hospital to deliver screening services <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The inclusion of MSE aims to reduce the workload of dentists and make the program feasible on a national scale.</s>
          <s>Meanwhile, Scenario C, which excludes MSE and VETDN, offers the greatest QALYs gained because the target population would be seen directly by dentists, resulting in a much higher screening accuracy.</s>
          <s>However, it should be ensured that there is an enough number of dentists in public system to screen oral lesion while patients are at precancerous or early stages.</s>
          <s>For other countries without dentist accessibility <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> .</s>

          <s>When comparing these results to other three cost-effectiveness studies previously published in academic journals, the community-based program of early oral cancer screening by trained health workers for population aged over 40 years in the United States yielded similar results, indicating poor value for money <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, when changed to high-risk males aged over 40, the program is likely to be cost-saving.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the cost-effectiveness study of oral cancer screening in India was cost-effective <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is because the screening program in India needs only one step, i.e. visual examination by healthcare workers, and targets high-risk population whose age is over 35 years and who use either alcohol or tobacco or both.</s>
          <s>The age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of this Indian population is very high compared to the target population in Thailand, especially in males (12.6 VS 3.9 per 100,000) <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The study in the Netherlands confirmed that visual screening by specialists is cost-effective compared to the no-screening strategy; however, it is an opportunistic program rather than the populationbased interventions investigated in the other three countries <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>The key strength of this study is not only a health economic evaluation in Southeast Asia where oral cancer prevalence is moderate, but also the use of a new approach for threshold analysis to determine program characteristics that can make screening an optimal policy option in the Thai setting.</s>
          <s>These program characteristics can be used to further future research and development.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, this study has some limitations.</s>
          <s cert="0.9614782333374023" id="dataset-6" type="Tabular data">Firstly, costs and performances of screening tools were collected from only one of total five sites due to budget constraints.</s>

          <s>Secondly, performances of the screening program received from the pilot study were overall proportion, unconsidered difficult between the screening of small and large lesions.</s>
          <s>Thirdly, certain variables were derived from international studies due to the lack of local epidemiological data.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, oral cancer experts had examined all variables using the face validity method.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The current oral cancer screening program for the Thai population aged above 40 years was not cost-effective.</s>
          <s>The screening can be cost-effective only if: 1) the sensitivity and specificity of MSE are more than 60%, 2) the sensitivity and specificity of VETDN are greater than 90%, or 3) the low accuracy steps like MSE or VETDN are removed from the screening program.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, these recommendations did not take into account the administration and management of the screening program such as workload, human resources, and implementation feasibility.</s>
          <s>Thus, policy makers should account for all various factors when implementing policy in a country-specific context.</s>
