            <s>Background: The epidemiological characteristics of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the autonomous region of Xinjiang Uygur have been largely unknown.</s>
            <s>This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and demographic risk factors of SCD in Xinjiang, China.</s>
            <s>Methods: This retrospective study reviewed medical records from 11 regions in Xinjiang with different geography (north and south of the Tian Shan mountain range), gross domestic product, and ethnicity (Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Hui).</s>
            <s>SCD was defined as unexpected death due to cardiac reasons within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms, including sudden death, unexpected death, and nonviolent death.</s>
            <s>Monitoring was conducted throughout 2015.</s>
            <s>Demographic and mortality data were recorded and age-adjusted standardized risk ratio (SRR) was analyzed.</s>
            <s>Results: Among 3,224,103 residents, there were 13,308 all-cause deaths and 1244 events of SCD (784 men and 460 women; overall incidence 38.6 per 100,000 residents).</s>
            <s>SCD was associated with age (χ2 = 2105.3),</s>
            <s>but not geography.</s>
            <s>Men had an increased risk of SCD compared with women (SRR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.10-2.79).</s>
            <s>The risk of SCD was highest in residents of the Uyghur (SRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.42)</s>
            <s>and Kazakh (SRR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.29-2.87)</s>
            <s>compared with those of the Han.</s>
            <s>Poor economic development was associated with elevated risk of SCD (SRR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.38).</s>
            <s>Conclusion: SCD is an important public health issue in China.</s>
            <s>Our understanding of the demographic differences on SCD in Xinjiang, China may improve the risk stratification and management to reduce the incidence and lethality of SCD.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is sudden, unexpected, natural death that occurs when the heart fails to contract <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>SCD is a major public health issue worldwide.</s>
          <s>Coronary heart disease accounts for~80% of SCD cases <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> , and is responsible for the greater portion of total deaths among adults in industrialized countries <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Across the world the incidence of SCD ranges widely, from 52.5 per 100,000 person-years in Asia to 111.9 per 100,000 person-years in Australia, as estimated by the numbers of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests attended by emergency medical services <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In China, Hua et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>conducted an epidemiological investigation of SCD that covered Beijing, Guangzhou, Yuxian, and Kelamayi.</s>
          <s>These locales are, respectively, the capital city of China in the north, a coastal metropolis of Southern China, a county in Northern China, and a city in the autonomous region of Xinjiang Uygur (hereafter referred to as Xinjiang) in Northwest China.</s>
          <s>The overall incidence of SCD during the year 2015 was 41.8 per 100,000, with specific rates for Beijing, Guangzhou, Yuxian, and Kelamayi of 49.9, 46.9, 39.3, and 29.3 per 100,000, respectively.</s>
          <s>These results showed that the incidence of SCD varied widely by geographic region.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Rates of SCD in China may also vary widely across a single geographic region.</s>
          <s>For example, while the study of Hua et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>sampled the single city of Kelamayi within Xinjiang, the data was far from representative of the entire region.</s>
          <s>The Tian Shan mountain range divides Xinjiang into two major areas, Southern Xinjiang and Northern Xinjiang, that differ in climate and demographics <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Xinjiang also borders many countries that influence the area culturally, and residing within are as many as 47 ethnic groups, including the Han, Uygur, Kazakh, and Hui.</s>
          <s>Each ethnic group varies by residence, culture, religion, genetics, and history.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We conducted an epidemiological investigation of 11 sites within Xinjiang to understand better the geographic, economic, and ethnic factors that may contribute to SCD in China.</s>

          <s>While the city of Kelamayi was selected for investigation in 2005 by Hua et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , little is known of the epidemiological characteristics of SCD in other areas of Xinjiang.</s>
          <s>To rectify this lack of information, for the present study we sampled 11 sites within Xinjiang that were chosen with consideration for natural <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> Age-adjusted SCD incidence among 11 sites in Xinjiang environment, economic development, ethnic distribution, and urban/rural differences.</s>
          <s>This is the first study of the epidemiological features of SCD among the ethnic groups Uyghur, Hui, and Kazakh, which were also compared with the Han ethnic group.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Overall, 1244 SCDs occurred among the 11 selected sites during the study period, with an estimated SCD incidence of 38.6 per 100,000 residents.</s>
          <s>While studies concerning SCD rates in China are limited, the overall rate of 38.6 per 100,000 residents that we report here is lower than the overall rate of 41.8 found by Hua et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> while higher than the rate of 29.3 that that group reported specifically for the city of Kelamayi.</s>
          <s>A probable reason for these differences may lie with the demographic features of the study population, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and genetics <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another reason may be a difference in the definition of SCD.</s>
          <s>Our present study excluded deaths that occurred more than 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms, while the Hua et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> study included deaths from 1 to 2 h after onset.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether our results are truly distinct from the previous study.</s>
          <s>However, it is interesting to note that the estimated incidence of SCD in the current study was comparable with those reported in other countries of Asia such as Japan (37 per 100,000) and Tailand (38 per 100,000) <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, our findings confirmed the concept that the Asia population had a relatively lower risk of SCD compared with that in the western countries, which was possibly attributed to the different proportion of underlying diseases <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study showed that the men had a 1.75 fold risk of SCD compared to that of women.</s>
          <s>Although the mechanism was not analyzed in depth, differences in SCD incidence between the genders has been well reported in previous studies, with male-to-female ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.6 <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>

            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been proposed that the lower incidence of SCD among women may be associated with estrogen, which is believed to have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , as mediated by estrogen receptors, both directly and indirectly <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition, the higher rate of SCD among men may be attributed to the higher prevalence of tobacco smoking in men in China <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was reported that for the year 2005, in China smoking was responsible for as many as 146,200 cardiovascular deaths <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the Chinese government has engaged in programs that discourage the use of tobacco, the prevalence of smoking is expected to decline, and with it smoking-related deaths, including SCD.</s>
          <s>Regarding ethnic groups in Xinjiang, in the present study the highest rate of SCD was detected in the Kazakh people, followed by the Uyghur, Han, and Hui.</s>
          <s>These variations may be ascribed to differences in cardiovascular disease among these peoples.</s>
          <s>In a national hypertension survey in China, among all 56 ethnic groups the Kazakh were among the top 5 in prevalence of hypertension, higher than the other 3 ethnic groups that were analyzed in the present study <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the present study, we also found a higher proportion of hypertension among the Kazakh compared with the other 3 ethnic groups considered.</s>
          <s>This may be due to higher salt intake, which is inherited culturally from a formerly nomadic lifestyle <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the higher incidence of SCD in the Kazakh people may be related to the higher prevalence of hypertension.</s>
          <s>Studies have also shown that valvular heart diseases were more common in the Han and Kazakh compared with the Uyghur <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The prevalence of chronic heart failure was higher in the Kazakh than the Han or Uyghur <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> , and the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was higher in the Uyghur than the Kazakh <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The variations in SCD incidence between the 4 ethnic groups considered here may also be related to genetic polymorphisms.</s>
          <s>As the case control study of Abudoukelimu et al. <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> showed, differences in polymorphisms of the NUMB (protein numb homolog) gene were significantly associated with differences in coronary artery disease between the Han and Uyghur study populations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We also stratified the 11 selected study sites according to 3 levels of economic development, and found that areas with the poorest level had the highest risk for SCD.</s>
          <s>This was consistent with Mensah et al.'s <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> study, which held that low economic status was a risk factor of cardiovascular death.</s>
          <s>Benefiting from continuous expansion and improvement of the medical security system in China, the gap in SCD incidence between high and low socioeconomic regions may become narrower.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study has several limitations.</s>
          <s>First, SCD cases were monitored for only 1 year, and therefore we could not analyze yearly variations in incidence.</s>
          <s>From this point of view, a further long-term cohort study is wanted.</s>
          <s>Secondly, the autopsy rate in China is low because of traditional views that regard autopsy as an insult or disrespect to the decedent <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our study, no necropsies were performed.</s>
          <s>Lack of autopsy data prevented us from identifying the specific cause of death in 14.2% of all SCD cases.</s>
          <s>Thirdly, there are 47 ethnic groups residing in Xinjiang, and we only evaluated the SCD rates of 4 of these.</s>
          <s>Further investigation of the other ethnic groups should be implemented, to assess comprehensively the SCD rates in Xinjiang.</s>
          <s>Fourthly, sampling weights were not considered in the current study which might weaken the representativeness of the entire province.</s>
