            <s>Due to a growing demand for a viable label-free observation method in the biomedical field, many techniques, such as quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy, have been studied, and a complementary approach, hyperspectral imaging, has also been introduced.</s>
            <s>We developed a highspeed hyperspectral imaging microscopy imaging method with commercially available apparatus, employing a liquid crystal tunable bandpass filter combined with a pixel-wise machine learning classification.</s>
            <s>Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the application of this method for stem cell research utilizing neural stem cells.</s>
            <s>Employing this microscopy method, with a 562 × 562 μm 2 field of view, 2048 × 2048 pixel resolution images containing 63 wavelength pixel-wise spectra could be obtained in 30 seconds.</s>
            <s>The neural stem cells were differentiated into neurons and astroglia (glia), and a four-class cell classification evaluation (including neuronal cell body, glial cell body, process and extracellular region) was conducted under co-cultured conditions.</s>
            <s>As a result, an average of 88% of the objects of interest were correctly classified, with an average precision of 94%, and more than 99% of the extracellular pixels were correctly segregated.</s>
            <s>These results indicated that the proposed hyperspectral imaging microscopy is feasible as a label-free observation method for stem cell research.</s>

            <s>These days in the fields of life science, biology and medicine, there has been a growing demand for label-free observation methods that allow for the assessment of biological materials repeatedly without any toxic effects and without the use of dyes or tags.</s>
            <s>One of the areas where this demand has been prominent is the field of pluripotent (or multipotent) cell research.</s>
            <s>Pluripotent cells, for example, induced pluripotent stem cells 1 (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells 2,3 (ESCs) and neural stem cells 4 (NSCs), have regenerative abilities and the capability to differentiate into multiple types of cells.</s>
            <s>Given their unique abilities in regeneration and pluripotency, regenerative and reparative therapies and cell-based therapies using these pluripotent cells have been intensively studied for a decade or more 5,6 .</s>
            <s>In addition to their direct use in therapy, they can also serve as powerful research tools for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in intractable diseases by building precise human models, for example, in neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease 7 , Huntington's disease 8 , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 9 , Alzheimer's disease 10 and fetal developmental defect myelomeningocele 11 .</s>
            <s>While pluripotent cells have potential roles to play, as mentioned above, and due to their regenerative ability and pluripotency, it is necessary to carefully control and monitor their differentiation processes repeatedly in order to achieve successful results.</s>
            <s>Under different culture environments, pluripotent cells can differentiate into different types of cells 1 , and there is a dangerous possibility for tumor formation associated with residual undifferentiated cells used in autologous therapy 12 .</s>

            <s>Among these label-free observation methods, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) have been intensively studied recently.</s>

          <s>Furthermore, only spectral information was used to discriminate cells.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Considering the growing demand for a viable label-free observation method in the biomedical field, we investigated the feasibility of using the HSI method for rapid label-free observation in stem cell research at a practical level.</s>
          <s>The proposed HSI microscopy employed in this study was simply composed of a research grade microscope, a liquid crystal tunable bandpass filter and an industry grade area scan camera.</s>
          <s>Using our HSI microscopy method, with a 562 × 562 μm 2 field of view, a 2048 × 2048 pixel image containing 63-wavelength spectra can be obtained in 30 seconds (even half of the data were not implicated in the following cell classification), which is far more rapid than RS and the laser scanning confocal HSI microscopy method.</s>
          <s>Selecting signal wavelengths one by one using the tunable filter, you can compensate for optical losses and wavelength differences in quantum efficiency to some degree, which originates in various parts of the apparatus, by controlling the exposure time.</s>
          <s>Hence our HSI microscopy system has a uniform signal dynamic range across a wide range of wavelengths (for the wavelengths included in the analyses, the number of intensity values contained in a raw object image was 2,414 ± 108, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S8</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In regard to the reference spectra, no strict reference was required in the proposed HSI microscopy, and so spectra of the illumination without specimens were used as a flat-field reference.</s>
          <s>We evaluated the feasibility of using other specimens without cells (only culture dishes and media) as a reference, however, the intrinsic variations (for example, the thickness/flatness of the glass, or the depth of the medium) and the differences of these parameters between the reference and target specimens resulted in less stable measurements.</s>
          <s>The major downside to using our HSI microscopy is its quantitative capability.</s>
          <s>With a reference spectra which is acquired without a specimen, the spectra obtained consists not only of cell specific information, but also components that stem from culture dishes and media.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is expected that there will be some difficulty in directly evaluating the exact cell state, based only on the acquired raw spectra.</s>
          <s>Another factor which affects the quantitative capability is chromatic aberration.</s>
          <s>Considering the working distance, the correction collar for compensating for cover glass thickness and the transmission performance across the wavelengths we focused on, we chose a universal semi-apocromatic objective lens in this study (refer to the Methods section for the details).</s>
          <s>In contrast to the previous confocal HSI microscopy, which implemented a zero chromatic aberration reflective objective lens 20 , due to the remaining chromatic aberration, the focal plane for each wavelength is slightly shifted individually.</s>
          <s>Consequently, a light beam transmitted through one point of the object affects pixels near the corresponding object location in the acquired image depending on the wavelength.</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, as shown in the classification evaluation in this study ( <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ), the spectra acquired by our HSI microscopy could be successfully utilized for classifying cell types under certain circumstances (using the same product dishes and media, and cells of the same lineage).</s>
          <s>Taking the results of the cell classification evaluation into account, our microscopy method seems to retain enough quantitative accuracy for some practical applications in stem cell research.</s>

          <s>Recent studies have reported differences in the refractive index (RI) among subcellular components, i.e., nuclei have a lower refractive index than cytoplasm <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> , and the mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum have their own unique RIs 30-32 , respectively.</s>
          <s>In addition to intracellular RI differences, cell type dependent differences <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34</ref> and cell state dependent differences <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">35</ref> have also been demonstrated.</s>
          <s>In the observation of transparent material using reflectance hyperspectral/multispectral microscopy, the backscattered light is imaged, which relies on the inherent differences in the RI of structures (the cytoplasm is shown as a bright intensity and the nucleus scatters less light, so it is shown as a dark area) <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25,</ref>

            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, it is considered that our HSI microscopy, with its implemented, transmitted light path, relies on chromatic dispersion (the dependency of the RI on the wavelength).</s>
          <s>Transmitted light passing through subcellular components causes refraction due to the differences in the RIs of those subcellular components.</s>
          <s>Because the angle of refraction is dependent on the angle of incidence, the RIs of the subcellular components, which have different shapes and densities, cause refraction that varies differently from each other, accompanied by wavelength differences.</s>
          <s>Using the proposed HSI microscopy presented in this study, the integrated results of these refractions could be recorded for each wavelength.</s>

          <s>When you assess the feasibility of adapting some method for a certain application, the materials and experiments you use, and the evaluation scheme employed are highly important.</s>
          <s>Regarding materials and experiments, we focused on the study on developmental brain disease using NSCs in this study.</s>
          <s>In malformed brains, which are observed in some developmental brain diseases (for example, Down syndrome), impaired differentiation has been reported, resulting in an altered ratio of neurons to glia <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38</ref> and abnormal astrocyte reactivity <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">39</ref> .</s>
          <s>For this reason, we conducted a cell classification evaluation with differentiated NSCs, which were, as previously reported 4 , differentiated into TuJ-1 positive neurons and GFAP positive glia <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Regarding the evaluation scheme, evaluating practical performance is important.</s>
          <s>In previous studies, the authors manually extracted the target spectra in cells from the data obtained, and evaluated classification performance only with extracted spectra <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>This evaluation scheme is useful for evaluating feasibility at the conceptual level, but the lack of an evaluation for the extraction of the target spectra may cause performance discrepancy in practical applications.</s>
          <s>In this study, focusing on processing spectra and image analysis, we employed a pixel-wise classification based on machine learning, and included almost all types of pixels into the evaluation (except pixels consisting of double positive and double negative cells).</s>
          <s>Using this evaluation scheme, you can tell simultaneously how spectra are precisely classified between the spectra of interest and non-interest spectra (like extracellular regions), and between the spectra of interest (for example, between neurons and glia).</s>
          <s>Hence, we concluded that this evaluation scheme is more practical than those previously utilized.</s>
          <s>In this study, by means of the pixel-wise classification evaluated with this method, differentiated NSCs were precisely classified (an average of 88% of the objects of interest were correctly classified with a precision average of 94%, and more than 99% of the extracellular pixels were correctly segregated).</s>
          <s>We consider that this performance is promising for some experiments concerning developmental brain diseases.</s>
          <s>For example, in a study on Down syndrome, the number of neurons decreased 30-40% in the patient group <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this case, you can correctly detect the deference between cells of the patients and cells of the control group with our classification system (with 12% misclassification).</s>
          <s>In the evaluation results, the recall values (indicating how many relevant pixels/objects were properly predicted) of the glial cell bodies were lower than that for the other classes.</s>
          <s>This was one of the reasons that the contrasts in the widely expanded glial cells were rather low, especially in regions distal from the nuclei.</s>
          <s>As mentioned above, the downside of our microscopy method is its relatively poor quantitative capability.</s>
          <s>Refining the reference spectra or the achromatic conditions would improve these contrasts.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The main limitation of this study was the cell types (TuJ-1 and GFAP double positive and double negative cells) that were excluded from the classification evaluation.</s>
          <s>In this study, some cells showed intermediate level signals of both TuJ-1 and GFAP, some showed definitely negative against both antibodies, and yet other cells showed a strongly positive signal for one staining, while showing an intermediate signal for another.</s>
          <s>These cells were excluded because we did not characterize these cells in detail.</s>
          <s>However, because these cells, which might be undifferentiated stem cells, play important roles in some cases, we consider that further studies should be conducted in order to characterize these cells and evaluate them for classification performance.</s>
          <s>Another limitation was that we stained cells before image acquisition.</s>
          <s>We took this approach to obtain ideal pixel-wise ground truth information (answer labels) for training of machine learning system and the evaluation of the classification performance, but the staining process might have affected the statuses of the cellular components, e.g.</s>
          <s>RIs and morphology, resulting in artificial signals.</s>
          <s>Further studies using living cell acquisition should be performed to confirm advantages of proposed HSI microscopy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In summary, we investigated the feasibility of a label-free HSI microscopy method combined with machine learning for application in stem cell research.</s>
          <s>With the sole use of commercially available apparatus, we developed a high speed HSI microscopy method capable of wide area observation.</s>
          <s>Employing a pixel-wise machine learning classification method on data obtained using the HSI microscopy method, we demonstrated that differentiated NSCs were precisely classified in a practical evaluation.</s>
          <s>The results indicate that the proposed HSI microscopy observation method is feasible for label-free observation in stem cell research.</s>

        <figDesc>Figure 3. Cellular components and spectral analysis. This figure shows a cluster image of NSCs (a) and the corresponding immunofluorescent image (b: TuJ-1 in green, GFAP in red, nuclei in blue). (c) Pixel-wise class assignments: Neuronal cell bodies (blue), glial cell bodies (red), processes (green) and the external region (gray). (d) Superimposed image of (a,c). (e) Major average pixel-wise spectra of four object classes. (f) Pixelwise spectra map for neuronal cell body and glial cell body corresponding to (e). Most of the objects belonging to each class contained all four major spectra, and each spectrum corresponded to a different intracellular location. In the neuronal cell bodies, the center areas had a high intensity spectrum N high , on the other hand, the edges of the cells showed a low intensity spectrum N low (f). In the glial cell bodies, a high intensity spectrum G high was observed only in the center areas, whereas a low intensity spectrum G low was observed broadly in the edges of the cells and the inner areas (f). Arrows: Neurons. Arrowheads: Glia cells. DP: Double positive cells. DN: Double negative cells. Asterisks: Excluded cells. Black diamond: Wavelength specific differences between spectra. N high and N low : High and low intensity major spectra of neuronal cell body. G high and G low : High and low intensity major spectra of glial cell body. Scale bar: 100 μm.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Fig. 5a; see Supplementary Fig. S6 for standard deviation). As shown in the color-coded cluster image (Fig. 5c), different clusters were assigned almost exclusively to the cell region (yellow, red, dark purple) and the external region (green, cyan, blue, magenta). Among the 16 clusters, there were clusters which were only seen in neuronal cell bodies (Fig. 5d, cluster 5), clusters which were seen broadly in cells (Fig. 5d, cluster 6), clusters which were exclusively seen outside of cells (Fig. 5d, cluster 9) and clusters composed of the edges of cells and subcellular components (Fig. 5d, cluster 12). Even clusters which had close intensities each other were clearly assigned to different objects (Fig. 5b,d, cluster 6 and 9; where the average difference in signal intensity through the wavelengths was 74.0 ± 17.9 arbitrary unit, a.u.).</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Figure 4. Overview of the cell classification procedure. 25-band spectral data was converted to the cluster image using a spectrum-wise clustering method. The pixel values of the cluster image indicate spectral categories. Pixel-wise cell classification was performed on the cluster image using in-house machine learning software, and the software returned the class-labeled image as a result. The machine learning software implemented a Random Forest classifier and multi-scale morphological features were employed.</figDesc>
