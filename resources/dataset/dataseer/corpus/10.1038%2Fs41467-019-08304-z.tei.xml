            <s>T cells targeting shared oncogenic mutations can induce durable tumor regression in epithelial cancer patients.</s>
            <s>Such T cells can be detected in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, but whether such cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with the common metastatic epithelial cancer patients is unknown.</s>
            <s>Using a highly sensitive in vitro stimulation and cell enrichment of peripheral memory T cells from six metastatic cancer patients, we identified and isolated CD4 + , and CD8 + memory T cells targeting the mutated KRAS G12D and KRAS G12V variants, respectively, in three patients.</s>
            <s>In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins.</s>
            <s>Therefore, memory T cells targeting unique as well as shared somatic mutations can be detected in the peripheral blood of epithelial cancer patients and can potentially be used for the development of effective personalized T cell-based cancer immunotherapy across multiple patients.</s>

          <s>T umors express proteins harboring unique mutations that are absent from normal tissue.</s>
          <s>Some of these mutated proteins can trigger specific T-cell responses and therefore can potentially be recognized as neoantigens.</s>
          <s>Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are enriched with neoantigen-specific T cells <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>

            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, owing to tumor heterogeneity, targeted neoantigen(s) can be expressed in some, but not all, tumor cells, which may limit ACT efficacy.</s>
          <s>Therefore, targeting common oncogenic mutations that are more likely to be expressed in all tumor cells and are essential for tumor survival represents a more promising approach.</s>
          <s>We have recently shown that ACT using autologous TILs targeting the HLA-C*08:02 restricted KRAS G12D epitope could lead to tumor regression in a patient with metastatic colon cancer 7 .</s>

          <s>The absence of autologous lines to validate tumor recognition by enriched T cells and the need to avoid raising de novo recognition against irrelevant antigens suggests that new approaches should focus on T-cell populations that are more likely to be clinically relevant.</s>
          <s>Although the naive T-cell (TN) repertoire is highly polyclonal and antigen inexperienced, the memory repertoire represents cells that have already been stimulated by their cognate antigens and more likely arose following infection or malignancy.</s>
