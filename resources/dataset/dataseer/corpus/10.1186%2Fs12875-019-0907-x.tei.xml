            <s>Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most prevalent subtype of urinary incontinence and is a bothering condition in women.</s>
            <s>Only a minority of those with SUI consult a general practitioner (GP).</s>
            <s>EHealth with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective in reducing incontinence symptoms and might increase access to care.</s>
            <s>The role of the GP regarding such an eHealth intervention is unknown.</s>
            <s>The aim of the study is to gain insight into the attitudes towards a PFMT internet-based, eHealth, intervention for SUI.</s>
            <s>Methods: A qualitative study was conducted.</s>
            <s>Data were collected through semi-structured interviews among purposively sampled GPs.</s>
            <s>Audio records were fully transcribed, and analysed thematically.</s>
            <s>Results: Thirteen GPs were interviewed, nine females and four males.</s>
            <s>Three themes emerged: appraisal of eHealth as a welcome new tool, mixed feelings about a supportive role, and eHealth is no cure-all.</s>
            <s>GPs welcomed eHealth for SUI as matching their preferences for PFMT and having advantages for patients.</s>
            <s>With eHealth as stand-alone therapy GPs were concerned about the lack of feedback, and the loss of motivation to adhere to the intervention.</s>
            <s>Therefore, GPs considered personal support important.</s>
            <s>The GP's decision to recommend eHealth was strongly influenced by a woman's motivation and her age.</s>
            <s>GPs' treatment preferences for elderly are different from those for young women with SUI; both PFMT and eHealth are perceived less suitable for older women.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: EHealth with PFMT fits into the GPs' routine practice of SUI and adds value to it.</s>
            <s>Although there is evidence that eHealth as a stand-alone intervention is effective, GPs consider personal support important to supplement the perceived shortcomings.</s>
            <s>Probably GPs are not aware of, or convinced of the existing evidence.</s>
            <s>Training should address this issue and should also focus on common misunderstandings about regular care for women with SUI, such as the idea that PFMT is not suitable for the elderly.</s>
            <s>Improving GPs' knowledge that eHealth can be a stand-alone therapy for SUI facilitates the implementation in daily care.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Urinary incontinence is a common condition in women and has a major impact on quality of life.</s>
          <s>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most prevalent subtype of incontinence and is defined as the complaint of involuntary urinary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The overall prevalence rate of urinary incontinence varies between 25 and 48%, according to two European studies <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among women who report having urinary incontinence, the prevalence of SUI varies between 21 and 33% with a peak prevalence between 40 and 49 years <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening disease, it has major consequences in daily life.</s>
          <s>Women report the fear of being smelt; further, they feel embarrassed and have a low self-esteem <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Commonly women experience being limited in social or physical activities <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Among women with SUI only one in three seek professional help <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As for women with other types of urinary incontinence, barriers for seeking help are shame, a lack of knowledge about treatment options, and the idea that incontinence is a consequence of giving birth or ageing <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Women with severe symptoms or an impaired quality of life, are more likely to consult a healthcare worker <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Once women seek help for urinary incontinence, they mostly consult a general practitioner (GP) <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>GPs encounter difficulties in providing the treatment to women with SUI that is recommended in guidelines <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The recommended first-line treatment for SUI consists of lifestyle advice, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), or pessary placement <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>GPs perform the diagnostic procedure according to available guidelines <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , but only one-third of women receive optimal treatment <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Factors that prevent GPs from providing optimal treatment are a lack of time, a lack of knowledge, and the feeling of not being capable to coach PFMT <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although GPs experience barriers in providing care for urinary incontinence, they consider optimising treatment of SUI important <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A possible solution to improve care for SUI is internetbased therapy, eHealth.</s>
          <s>EHealth interventions have shown to be effective for various health-related topics for example, substance abuse, mental health, and chronic pain <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For SUI, there is also evidence that an eHealth intervention is effective.</s>
          <s>Two Swedish randomised controlled trials (one with an internet-based and one with a mobile phone intervention) and one observational feasibility study (internet-based intervention) have been conducted in this area <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The Swedish trials showed that symptom severity and incontinence-related quality of life improved significantly after women received an Internet-based intervention, or a mobile phone app intervention with PFMT <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>During the Internet-based intervention, there was no face-to-face contact, but a urotherapist sent reminders via e-mail and was available for questions if needed.</s>
          <s>Most women appreciated this contact because it motivated them, and they felt supported without being exposed <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results of these studies cannot be simply added up as they differed in the application they used; internet-based or mobile-phone.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The role of GPs regarding an eHealth intervention for SUI is unknown.</s>
          <s>Possibly, women consult their GP with questions about an eHealth intervention after they started the intervention without having consulted a GP.</s>
          <s>Alternatively, GPs might recommend women with SUI to use eHealth, which could be attractive especially for those GPs with difficulties in providing regular care for SUI.</s>
          <s>Thus, the GP could become involved when eHealth for SUI would be implemented within the health care system.</s>
          <s>To implement an eHealth intervention successfully, the stakeholders' attitudes need to be explored <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore this study aims to get insight into the GPs' attitudes towards an internet-based, eHealth, intervention for women with SUI.</s>

          <s>EHealth matched with the GP's first-choice treatment for women with SUI because the eHealth programme was based completely on PFMT.</s>
          <s>Most GPs mentioned approachability and flexibility as advantages of eHealth that could increase access to care for women who would otherwise not seek help because of time restriction, shame, or resistance to physical examination.</s>

          <s>The opinions about how and by whom support should be provided varied among GPs.</s>
          <s>Several GPs suggested that less intensive support could take place within primary care.</s>
          <s>Several weeks after a woman started with eHealth, either the GP or the nurse practitioner could ask a woman whether she noticed improvement of SUI.</s>
          <s>This type of support is in line with their routine practice because GPs highly appreciated following their patient's progress for example by updates from the physiotherapist about the results of PFMT.</s>
          <s>The idea to collaborate with nurse practitioners was based on GPs' experiences with eHealth for mental health problems.</s>
          <s>A few GPs mentioned that these nurses had more time to motivate women.</s>
          <s>One GP considered it as her own moral duty to strongly motivate women to adhere to PFMT.</s>
          <s>Several GPs thought more profound support had to be performed by the physiotherapist, and therefore eHealth should not be implemented within general practice.</s>
          <s>A few GPs felt incapable of assessing the strength of the pelvic floor muscle, which restricted them in monitoring the effect of PFMT.</s>
          <s>They acknowledged having less affinity with SUI or pelvic floor problems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A few GPs were concerned that, without their interference, women would start eHealth without having a correct diagnosis.</s>

          <s>They mentioned that women who lack motivation for PFMT will not be helped by eHealth either.</s>
          <s>For example, a woman who already performed regular PFMT without success would not be motivated to start with eHealth.</s>

          <s>Women with visual impairment, lower education, and a language barrier would be less suitable for eHealth.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, GPs highlighted that patients with severe incontinence, psychiatric diseases, complex co-morbidity, or a history of sexual abuse might need more help than eHealth could offer.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Age was also named by many GPs as a determinant factor in care for women with SUI.</s>
          <s>Younger women were perceived to benefit more from eHealth because time-consuming jobs and/or the time needed to spend on care for children restricted them in visiting a physiotherapist.</s>
          <s>A few GPs thought that eHealth would perfectly suit post-partum women because, during pregnancy gymnastics, they might already have gained skills on how to contract their pelvic floor muscles.</s>
          <s>In routine practice several GPs were more inclined to refer a young women to the physiotherapist or to the specialist.</s>
          <s>For younger women, SUI was considered unacceptable and more bothersome, partly because they might be more sexually active.</s>
          <s>A few GPs thought that incontinence in young women could have been caused by an underlying disease that needed to be ruled out by a specialist.</s>

          <s>This study showed that GPs preferred PFMT, mostly by a physiotherapist, in their routine practice for SUI.</s>
          <s>EHealth with PFMT was welcomed by GPs as a new tool that they would recommend to their patients.</s>
          <s>For patients with SUI approachability and flexibility were considered as major advantages which improves access to care.</s>
          <s>GPs also mentioned that eHealth as a stand-alone intervention has its disadvantages, namely the lack of personal feedback and the risk that patients lose motivation due to absence of someone who supports them.</s>
          <s>Therefore, most GPs believed that personal support during an eHealth intervention would increase its effectiveness, but they were inconclusive about how and by whom support should be provided.</s>
          <s>The recommendation of eHealth depended on factors such as a patient's motivation and preference, as well as her age.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The perceived advantages of eHealth in our study correspond with previous studies on eHealth interventions for other health problems.</s>
          <s>GPs consider approachability and flexibility to be major advantages for patients <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27]</ref> , which improve access to care <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to literature, GPs emphasise that the integration of eHealth within frequently used, evidence-based web pages eases access and is less time consuming <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>GPs also mentioned disadvantages of eHealth as a stand-alone intervention which are related to the diagnostic procedure and to the monitoring of the intervention.</s>
          <s>They were concerned about the absence of a diagnostic procedure; women with a diagnosis other than SUI could incorrectly start with eHealth.</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, former studies suggest that women can accurately diagnose themselves through a questionnaire <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, GPs thought that the absence of support within eHealth could make the intervention less effective because women lose motivation to perform PFMT.</s>
          <s>However, studies on eHealth interventions for SUI have shown those interventions to be successful in improving SUI without face-to-face support <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, evidence is inconclusive in showing superiority of PFMT that is supervised by a physiotherapist, over home and non-supervised PFMT <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Some GPs preferred eHealth supported by a physiotherapist probably because GPs acknowledged their lack of affinity with pelvic floor problems, and they felt incapable of monitoring the strength of the pelvic floor muscle.</s>
          <s>Previous research on urinary incontinence in primary care confirmed these feelings of incapability, as well as lack of affinity <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>EHealth has been shown to increase the feeling of being a more competent caregiver <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , which possibly explains why GPs in our study welcomed eHealth as a new tool.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Lastly, this study implicates that GPs might be prejudiced about age and treatment for women with SUI.</s>
          <s>GPs expected that young women would be more suitable for an eHealth intervention compared with older women, but a previous eHealth study for SUI showed that the probability of a successful outcome increases with age <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Caution is needed, however, as eHealth interventions for urinary incontinence are only studied in a relatively young population <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also within routine practice for SUI, GPs are prejudiced regarding a woman's age as some GPs in this study thought that older women would not profit from PFMT.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, a Cochrane review showed that PFMT is effective for women from different age groups <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>GPs in this study were also not inclined to refer older women with co-morbidity to a specialist because of perceived risks of complications after surgery.</s>
          <s>However, evidence is inconclusive about differences in complication rates between older and younger women who underwent surgery for their incontinence <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These discrepancies between practice and evidence correspond with the findings from literature of well-known facts that women with urinary incontinence receive suboptimal treatment <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study has some strength as it is the first to our best knowledge regarding attitudes of GPs about eHealth for urinary incontinence.</s>
          <s>As eHealth is a broad concept varying from telecommunication to web portals, it is difficult to compare different eHealth studies.</s>
          <s>Another strength is the inclusion of GPs with a variety in demographic characteristics.</s>
          <s>We included relatively young GPs whose attitudes are of special interest because these GPs are going to be confronted with eHealth in their future career.</s>
          <s>Our study also shows the limitation that the findings are not reflective for the whole profession of GPs because a qualitative study is by nature not generalisable to the wider population.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we could not prevent response bias as we questioned GPs on a conceptual eHealth intervention <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , although we explained that it was based on the one used in the Swedish study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The GPs in our study express reluctance with using eHealth as stand-alone intervention which shows that they are either not familiar with the current evidence on the topic, or that they found that the studies are not convincing.</s>
          <s>The GPs in our study also mentioned that before they would use or recommend eHealth they need to be sure that it is evidence-based.</s>
          <s>Trust in eHealth could increase with training that make GPs familiar with the existing evidence on potential future eHealth therapy <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, training is needed to improve current incontinence care, for example by addressing common misunderstandings among GPs such as the effectiveness of regular PFMT for different age groups.</s>
          <s>Before eHealth can operate as a stand-alone therapy, also research on an eHealth intervention in Dutch women with SUI might be necessary for these Dutch GPs to gain trust in its self-reliant aspects of eHealth.</s>
          <s>This process of making sense of an innovation is an important step for the implementation of an eHealth intervention for SUI, which is commonly overlooked within implementation studies <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The findings of this study are important for the design of the intervention.</s>
          <s>GPs were concerned that women for which eHealth is not satisfying might become discouraged to seek help.</s>
          <s>These concerns could be covered by providing information about when to consult a GP, within the eHealth application.</s>
          <s>Also, sending reminders throughout the course of the intervention will increase adherence to the training.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>EHealth based on PFMT is a welcome new tool that fits into the GPs' practice for patients with SUI.</s>
          <s>Because of its approachability and flexibility, it could provide care to a broader group of patients who would otherwise not seek help.</s>
          <s>EHealth that functions as a stand-alone therapy needs trust from GPs, due to the perceived shortcoming of the absence of person support.</s>
          <s>GPs also thought that eHealth was no cure-all therapy, especially not for the elderly.</s>
          <s>Training should inform GPs about these new treatment possibilities for SUI and should focus on common misunderstandings about regular care for these women.</s>
          <s>Also more evidence or awareness is needed to convince the GPs on the added value of eHealth.</s>
