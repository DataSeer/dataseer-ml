          <head>Two series of lignin (LN)-based adsorbents, namely, cross-linked lignin (LNEs) with different crosslinking densities and carboxymethyl cross-linked lignin (LNECs) with various degrees of carboxymethyl substitution, were prepared to remove ofloxacin (OFL), a popular fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotic, from water. LNEs and LNECs exhibited satisfactory performance in OFL adsorption.</head>

            <s>The crosslinking density and degree of carboxymethyl substitution strongly affected the content and distribution of oxygen-containing groups in these LN-based adsorbents, which played important roles in OFL adsorption.</s>
            <s>The pH dependencies of the adsorption performance of LNEs and LNECs indicated the involvement of multiple adsorption mechanisms, including hydrogen bond, electrostatic attraction, π-π electron-donor-acceptor interactions, and negative charge-assisted hydrogen bond.</s>
            <s>Different mechanisms were dominant under various pH levels, in a near neutral pH, the synergistic effect of electrostatic attraction and π-π interaction allows LINEs and LINECs to reach maximum adsorption capacity.</s>

          <s>(Supporting <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Information Fig. S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The surface morphologies of LNEs and LNECs samples turned rougher and more compact owing to modifications in comparison with smooth surface of pure LN (Supporting Information <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> ).</s>

          <s>The FTIR spectrum of LN was quite similar to that of LNEs, which indicated that the crosslinking reaction could not significantly change the lignin structure and functional groups.</s>

          <s>The two series of LN-based adsorbents were employed to remove OFL from water.</s>
          <s>The pH effects were tested first owing to the significant influence of pH on adsorption behaviors, as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, LNEs and LNECs exhibited very similar pH dependence in each series.</s>
          <s>With the increase of pH, OFL uptakes increased at the beginning, reached a maximal value at initial solution pH of about 6.0 for LNEs but 7.0 for LNECs, and then decreased rapidly.</s>
          <s>The optimal adsorption capacities of LNEs and LNECs were higher than those of most of previously reported adsorbents (Supporting Information Table S1), indicating that these LN-based adsorbents had an advantageous effect in adsorption of OFL.</s>
          <s>As for the upward-climax-downward variation tendencies in the pH dependence of OFL uptakes by those two series of LN-based adsorbents, it was ascribed to the fact that pH would substantially change the surface charge properties of both adsorbents and adsorbates, and various adsorption mechanisms were involved to further affect the adsorption behaviors, which would be discussed in detail in the following section.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Moreover, the adsorption capacities of LNEs and LNECs dropped to near zero at initial pH of around 11.5 <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, 0.001 mol/L aqueous NaOH solution was selected as the desorption eluent to regenerate the LN-based adsorbents after saturated adsorption.</s>

          <s>suggested that the LN-based materials exhibited fine reusability, which was quite satisfactory for practical applications.</s>
          <s>In addition, the effects of various inorganic salts (NaCl, KCl, and Na 2 SO 4 ) indicated that the OFL uptakes of those LN-based adsorbents decreased with the increase of salt concentrations (Supporting Information <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. S4</ref> ) owing to electrostatic shielding and competitive adsorption effects <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>As for the coexisted organic matter, humic acid (HA), OFL uptakes of those LN-based adsorbents slightly increased at the beginning and then decreased with increasing the HA concentration (Supporting Information <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. S5a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The improved OFL uptakes at a low HA concentration (&lt;10 mg/L) might be due to a bridging effect linked lignin-based adsorbents and FQs 36 , since HA and lignin-based adsorbents have the similar molecular structures.</s>
          <s>At a higher HA concentration, this bridging effect was broken because of enhanced electrostatic repulsion between HA and lignin-based adsorbents; besides, <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. S5b</ref> in Supporting Information indicated an interaction existed between HA and OFL 37 , resulting in its competitive adsorption of OFL with LNEC5 and LNE2.</s>
          <s>In short, the inhibition rates of the three salts and HA on adsorption capacities of those lignin-based adsorbents were below 30% in the entire measured salt and HA concentration ranges, indicating that LNECs and LNEs possessed good anti-interference to these coexisted matters.</s>

          <s>Effect of Oxygen-Containing Groups.</s>
          <s>LN contains many oxygen-containing groups such as carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and lactone, which could act as adsorption active sites but had different influences on OFL adsorption owing to their various affinities with OFL.</s>
          <s>The contents of the functional groups would change after the crosslinking and etherification reactions as discussed in previous section, resulting in different adsorption capacities of LNEs and LNECs.</s>

          <s>Based on <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> , the maximal OFL uptakes of LNEs decreased with the decrease of the contents of both carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups owing to the reduction of adsorption active sites.</s>
          <s>For LNECs, although the content of phenolic hydroxyl groups decreased with the increase of the degree of carboxyl substitution, the sum of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups still increased from LNEC1 to LNEC5, resulting in improved adsorption capacities.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the molar stoichiometric ratio of total oxygen-containing groups to OFL uptakes was much higher than 1:1 ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ), indicating that many functional groups on the LN-based adsorbents could not be involved in this adsorption process.</s>
          <s>This finding may be caused by two facts.</s>
          <s>One was the steric effects of OFL having large molecular size.</s>
          <s>The other was very weak affinity of certain oxygen-containing group to OFL, resulting in little contribution to the adsorption.</s>
          <s>OFL contains various functional groups and is an amphoteric substance which has two pK a values (pK a1 = 5.98, pKa 2 = 8.00, <ref target="#tab_2" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this study, two series of LN-based adsorbents, LNEs and LNECs, were obtained and exhibited good performance in adsorption of OFL.</s>
          <s>After LN was cross-linked using EPI, the mechanical properties and chemical stability of LNEs were enhanced evidently; whereas further carboxymethyl modified LNECs showed improved adsorption capacities.</s>
          <s>Various adsorption mechanisms were involved at different pH levels.</s>
          <s>At acidic levels (initial pH of 2.0-4.0),</s>
          <s>H-bond mainly formed between -COOH or -OH of LN-based adsorbents, and -N-C of OFL was dominant.</s>
          <s>At weak acidic and neutral conditions (initial pH of 4.0-7.0), the synergistic effect of electrostatic attraction and π-π interaction allows LINEs and LINECs to reach maximum adsorption capacity.</s>
          <s>In π-π interactions, LN-based adsorbents acted as π-donor, whereas OFL served as π-acceptor.</s>
          <s>At alkaline levels (initial pH of 7.0-11.5),</s>
          <s>a special H-bond, charge-assisted H-bond, had a significant contribution to OFL adsorption.</s>
          <s>For more specific investigations at molecular level, four FQs with similar structures to OFL and their two sub structural analogs as molecular probes were studied and compared in their various adsorption behaviors and electrostatic potentials.</s>
          <s>FQs with secondary amino groups and low π electron cloud density were easier to bind with the LN-based adsorbents.</s>
          <s>Therefore, LNEs and LNECs can be used as efficient and environmental-friendly adsorbents for removal of FQs.</s>
          <s>This study provides theoretical guidance for the large-scale production of lignin-based adsorbents using low-cost industrial grade lignin in the future.</s>
