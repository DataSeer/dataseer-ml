        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Patients who attend the Emergency Department (ED) by their own initiative, without being referred by any health professional or institution, are known as self-referral patients <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the literature, this is one of the causes for the improper use of services <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> which results in ED overcrowding <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Factors influencing self-referral include socio-cultural and organisational changes <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , age, sex, socioeconomic status, accessibility to primary care, doctor-patient relationship, geographical area, and health condition or severity of the episode <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As Brezzi et al. stated, self-referral is increasing in developed countries and is attributed to different causes such as lack of accessibility or lack of trust in other levels of care, perceived severity, etc. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The Spanish National Health System is built on public founding, full coverage, free and equal accessibility and almost full benefits.</s>
          <s>It has three levels of care provision to respond to emergency situations: primary health care centres, Extra-hospital Emergency Services (EHES) and hospital ED, and a coordination centre that responds to telephone consultations.</s>
          <s>Individuals have different ways to request and receive health care in emergency situations.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1</ref> shows a diagram of these routes.</s>
          <s>In Spain, self-referral is the most frequent form of attendance to ED, representing 75.4% of the cases <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The Northern Huelva Health Area is a predominantly rural and remote region, with over 50% of the population living in rural municipalities of less than 10,000 inhabitants.</s>
          <s>The area is mostly mountainous, has 3,707 km <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> and a population of 69,921 inhabitants.</s>
          <s>The population density is low (18.6 inhabitants / km 2 ).</s>
          <s>As a consequence, communications are difficult, which means that more than half of the population needs more than 45 minutes to reach the nearest city <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Northern Huelva Health Area has six basic primary care areas and 11 EHES with mobile equipment for urgent care.</s>
          <s>Specialised assistance, including urgent and critical care, is provided at the Riotinto Hospital <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="figure">Fig 2 shows</ref> the location of the different resources of the Northern Huelva Health Area.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The increase of self-referral patients in the Riotinto Hospital ED, from 24.28% (5261) in 2003 up to 70.20% (17912) in 2011 and 62.63% (16915) in 2015, led us to investigate the factors that were involved in these changes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As a hospital located in a rural area, as described above, ED receives patients referred predominantly from primary care centres.</s>
          <s>However, during the period of this study, self-referrals reached similar percentages similar to national figures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>During the period referred in this study, the organisational and functional structure of Northern Huelva Health Area had an unequal distribution of quotas for primary care level.</s>
          <s>The general practitioner/health centre ratio was 1.02, with only one doctor in 9 out of the 11 EHES and in the 18 health centres.</s>
          <s>These doctors were responsible for a high demand work of around 1,450 emergencies per 1,000 inhabitants in the EHES.</s>
          <s>There was also a shortage of paediatricians in the health centres, which affected their normal activity.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, critical care transport equipment was not available in the area.</s>

          <s>66.5% of patients came from basic health areas non-adjacent to Riotinto Hospital.</s>
          <s>52.2% of them did not have EHES in their town, 4.2% did not have access to daily GP consultations, and in 25.5% of the cases the hospital route was shorter than the EHES route.</s>
          <s>Out of the total patients treated, 84.3% were discharged directly from the area of consultation.</s>

        <p>

          <s>Regarding the transfer time to the hospital, the mean transfer time was 28.44 minutes (SD 19.55); for 50% of the patients, it took a maximum of 27 minutes.</s>

          <s>The increase of self-referral contrasted with the decrease of referrals from EHES, which decreased from more than 50% to below 20%.</s>
          <s>Referrals from general practitioners (GP) were constant (10.6 ± 2.85%).</s>

          <s>From the organisational point of view, we need to consider the possible influence produced by the cessation of afternoon activity in some health centres and the closing of the "Minas de Riotinto" EHES, since this has an impact on the demand to the health area and the hospital ED.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>This work has allowed us to describe factors regarding the demand for emergency care of a specific population, with particular socio-demographic characteristics, population dispersion, resources, and a health care system that influences the behaviour of patients attending the Riotinto Hospital ED.</s>
          <s>We have seen in this study that the probability of self-referring to ED is influenced by the changes in the health system and the time it takes for the patient to get from their town to the EHES.</s>
          <s>Once the patient's severity level was introduced, it was this variable, along with the time to get to the emergency department, which modified the probability of self-referring to the emergency department.</s>
          <s>Secondly, it allowed us to use trend analysis to better anticipate future population behaviour, if the conditions remain unchanged.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The changes in the organisation and health care must be studied from the point of view of its impact, not only in terms of morbidity and mortality, but also taking into account the patients' behaviour when using resources and the accessibility that these resources have.</s>
          <s>Thus, the studied population, rural and remote, changed the pattern of origin of the patients who come to the hospital ED from being predominantly referred from primary care to self-referred <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These findings coincide with previous studies in which the lower Index Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the main predictive factor for the use of emergency services <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The great population dispersion, represented by the time of access to the health services, is a determining element that has acted as a necessary factor to expand and maintain the effects of the changes produced in the health system of the Northern Huelva Health Area.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The reasons for consultation and the final diagnosis could not be analysed due to their lack of coding.</s>
          <s>Diagnosis codes might help tackle this issue in the study.</s>
          <s>Patients may often be unable to judge the severity of their condition and may have considered non-urgent symptoms as urgent.</s>
          <s>Health problems are the main motivation for patients to attend the ED on self-referral, even for patients with non-urgent symptoms, and a health professional can refer these patients to either a GP or the ED [28].</s>
          <s>In addition, the level of triage of the Aurora software could not be obtained, and in the Diraya-Emergencies a variation was identified in the model used.</s>
          <s>The year's range "2012-2014" was discarded because of changes in the origin consignment items in the Emergency Admissions program, substituting the "self-referral" item for "transportation by own means" thus including all except those derived by ambulance.</s>
          <s>Another limitation was the absence of some demographic data not found in the records: marital status, employment situation, level of education, socioeconomic status, and ethnic background.</s>
