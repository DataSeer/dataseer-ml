          <s>Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is one of the 20 debilitating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that have been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Onchocerciasis is an eye and skin disease caused by infection with the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus.</s>
          <s>Worldwide there are 198 million people at risk of onchocerciasis, of which 99% live in Africa.</s>
          <s>In 2012 it was estimated that 17 million people are affected by the disease or at risk of infection in Ethiopia, making it one of the most affected countries worldwide <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2013, the Ethiopian government launched the Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme aimed at nationwide interruption of transmission of the disease by 2020 <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This programme is based on biannual mass drug administration (MDA) of the microfilaricidal agent ivermectin (Mectizan, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One of the largest epidemiological mapping efforts for O. volvulus was conducted in 20 African countries, called Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of Onchocerciasis (REMO) in support of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC).</s>
          <s>The main objective of REMO was to identify all high-risk areas where ivermectin treatment was needed.</s>
          <s>For this programme, diagnosis was based on examination of 30 to 50 adults for the presence of palpable onchocercal nodules in selected villages <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Besides the detection of palpable nodules and presence of microfilariae in skin biopsies, the most widely used test for monitoring and evaluation of MDA programmes currently is the detection of IgG4 antibodies to the parasitic antigen Ov16 <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>

          <s>Although such antibody test cannot distinguish between past and current infections, the presence of anti-Ov16 antibodies in young children provides evidence for recent exposure <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>

          <s>However, although Ov16 IgG4 serology has excellent specificity, it appears to have only moderate sensitivity.</s>

          <s>Current guidelines indicate 0.1% Ov16 serology in children under 10 years of age, but this is neither practical nor possible with the current Ov16 based tools as even a specificity of 97-98% is not sufficient to enable reliable detection of &lt; 0.1% prevalence <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Due to the small sample set (B. malayi-infected: n = 20; STH-infected: n = 20) and the limited background information available on these individuals, a more thorough investigation into the cross-reactivity of these diagnostic peptides in Onchocerca endemic and non-endemic settings towards STH infections was necessary.</s>

          <s>Therefore, biobanks containing samples from clear-cut cases and controls should be obtained and evaluated.</s>
          <s>Additionally, especially in the field of infectious diseases, there is a need to confirm that the biomarker is not affected by closely related conditions.</s>
          <s>In the case of biomarkers for onchocerciasis, it is of absolute importance to evaluate novel biomarkers in individuals that are infected with other helminths, such as W. bancrofti and B. malayi, causing lymphatic filariasis (LF), soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) or schistosomes, but live in non-, hypo-or meso-endemic areas for Onchocerca (0%, &lt; 20%, and between 20-45% nodule prevalence in adult males, respectively <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In this study, we specifically evaluated the reactivity towards the serological markers OvMP-1 and OvMP-23 in an area in Ethiopia that is highly endemic for STH and S. mansoni, but hypo-endemic for Onchocerca.</s>

          <s>The assessment of cross-reactivity with other related and/ or co-endemic infectious agents is a critical part of the analytical validation of novel diagnostic tools.</s>
          <s>Hence, this work represents an essential part of the analytical validation of the serological markers OvMP-1 and OvMP-23.</s>
          <s>We investigated the prevalence of antibodies against O. volvulus antigens in Jimma Town, an urban setting in the southwestern part of Ethiopia.</s>
          <s>Ethiopia is a country that has been identified as endemic for O. volvulus for many years <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>

          <s cert="0.9801995158195496" id="dataset-11" type="Tabular data">Using the anti-Ov16 IgG4 ELISA, exposure to Onchocerca was determined for all individuals (n = 303).</s>
          <s>Using this standard assay, the overall seropositivity rate for O. volvulus in our study population was 3.6%, which suggests a hypo-endemic transmission setting <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When focusing on the children under 10 years of age, a seroprevalence of 3.5% was observed.</s>
          <s>This finding indicates low prevalence of O. volvulus exposure but is still considerably higher than the target seroprevalence of 0.1% in the age group under 10 years as set by the WHO to define end of transmission and elimination <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is also still above the threshold of 1% or even 2%, which has recently been proposed as a more feasible threshold with the current Ov16 based tools <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, it is of importance to note that the Ov16 ELISA used in this study is a research-use only test that has not yet been subjected to a cross-validation with the original Ov16 ELISA or lateral flow assays.</s>
          <s>It remains possible that the use of slightly different technology led to different seropositivity rates.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Using the newly identified serodiagnostic peptide antigens OvMP-1 and OvMP-23, respectively 11.2% and 5.0% of investigated individuals tested positive.</s>
          <s>As described before, both peptide ELISAs were not 100% specific for O. volvulus and also appeared to provide a positive signal in individuals that were infected with Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti or STHs <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Of the samples that were seropositive for OvMP-1 (n = 34) or OvMP-23 (n = 15), 97.1% and 93.3%, respectively, were seronegative for anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies.</s>
          <s>However, these samples were not correlated to having a patent infection for STH or S. mansoni, indicating that carrying a patent STH or S. mansoni infection does not increase the chances of having antibodies that react with either OvMP-1 or OvMP-23.</s>
          <s>These individuals were therefore either truly exposed to O. volvulus but missed by the Ov16 IgG4 ELISA or infected with other agents that cause cross-reactivity with these peptides.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Based on the work presented here, the reactivity that was previously observed to OvMP-1 in STH infected individuals from Flores (Indonesia) is likely caused by an immunological agent other than STH or Schistosomes <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For OvMP-23 the data presented here confirm the previous observations that STH infected individuals do not have measurable antibody responses to the peptide <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Interestingly, in this area that is hypo-endemic for Onchocerca, it appeared that the peptide serology markers OvMP-1 and OvMP-23 did not mutually correlate, nor did they correlate with the Ov16 IgG4.</s>
          <s>It is not clear what the underlying cause is for this absence of correlation.</s>
          <s>Since no true gold standard diagnostic test exists for infection with O. volvulus, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the samples that have discordant results for these serological markers.</s>
          <s>It is possible that recognition of the three markers is affected by different life-cycle stages or sex of the present parasite.</s>
          <s>Alternatively, this might also reflect individual differences in MHC Class II haplotypes <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A combination of the serological markers might be needed to properly define infection status.</s>
          <s cert="0.9793514013290405" id="dataset-12" type="Tabular data">Similar observations were also made in a study where a set of four O. volvulus recombinant proteins were evaluated as serological markers, and where correlation between these markers was also often very weak <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One explanation for the lack of correlation between Ov16 IgG4 and the peptide markers might be found in the fact that it takes on average 15 months before an Ov16 IgG4 response can be detected, while an IgG response might already be observed 16 weeks after exposure <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[31,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While this is a drawback of IgG4-based tests, it has the advantage of showing very high specificity <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While Ov16 seroprevalence was low over all the age groups, for OvMP-1 there appeared to be a significant trend towards increased seroprevalence as age increases.</s>
          <s>This type of trend is typically attributed to ongoing transmission settings where development of antibodies is slow and prevalence is higher in the adult population <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For OvMP-23 there also appeared to be an increase in the age group between 14 and 18 years, which would indicate ongoing transmission.</s>
          <s>However, seroprevalence for OvMP-23 decreased again with increasing age, although not significantly.</s>
          <s>It is well known that immune responses against certain antigens can be shorter lived than responses against other antigens <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, this pattern might be indicative of the shorter longevity of OvMP-23 antibodies, resulting in a stabilization or even reduction in seroprevalence in higher age groups.</s>
          <s>These patterns might however also indicate that both Ov16 and OvMP-23 are specifically related to O. volvulus for which transmission in the studied area is low or even interrupted.</s>
          <s>In addition to exposure to O. volvulus, antibody reactivity to OvMP-1 and OvMP-23 might also be stimulated by other, yet undefined agents or organisms.</s>
          <s>Future evaluations with these diagnostic peptides are required to help elucidate the possible origin of cross-reactive signals.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>This work demonstrates that individuals with patent STH or S. mansoni infections have no higher prevalence of antibodies to both OvMP-1 and OvMP23 onchocerciasis peptide markers compared to uninfected individuals.</s>
          <s>This is an important aspect in the analytical validation of these biomarkers.</s>
          <s>However, more work is needed to evaluate the clinical utility of the selected peptide ELISAs in Onchocerca endemic and non-endemic populations, and to further investigate the origin of the discordancy with the Ov16 ELISA test and their mutual discordancy.</s>
