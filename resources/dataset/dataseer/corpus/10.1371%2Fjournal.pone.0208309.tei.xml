        <head>Population homogeneity</head>
        <p>
          <s>Discrete choice models and their variants are employed extensively for analyzing decision processes in various fields including transportation, marketing, social science, bio-statistics, and epidemiology.</s>
          <s>In discrete choice models, decision maker's choice behavior is examined as a response to several exogenous variables that include attributes of the choice alternative or characteristics of the decision maker.</s>
          <s>The widely employed traditional discrete choice models restrict the impact of exogenous variables to be the same across the entire sample of records.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The assumption is referred to as population homogeneity and is often highlighted as a limitation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Several approaches have been employed to address population homogeneity restriction in discrete choice models.</s>
          <s>Segmenting the population based on exogenous variables and estimating separate models for each segment is a common approach.</s>
          <s>However, because there may be many variables to consider in the segmentation scheme, the number of segments (formed by the combination of the potential segmentation variables) can explode rapidly.</s>
          <s>To address the potential explosion of segments, clustering methods have been employed where target groups are divided into different clusters based on a multivariate set of factors and separate models are estimated for each cluster.</s>
          <s>However, both methods require allocating data records exclusively to a particular cluster, and do not consider the possible effects of unobserved factors that may moderate the impact of observed exogenous variables.</s>
          <s>Additionally, these approaches might result in very few records in some clusters resulting in loss of estimation efficiency.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A second approach to allow heterogeneity effects (variations in the effects of variables across the sample population) is to specify random coefficients (rather than imposing fixed coefficients) (for example, see <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>But, while the mean of the random coefficients can be allowed to vary across decision makers based on observed exogenous variables, the random coefficients approach usually restricts the variance and the distributional form to be the same across all decision makers.</s>
          <s>A third approach to accommodate heterogeneity is to undertake an endogenous (or sometimes also referred to as latent) segmentation approach (see, for example <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In this approach, decision makers are allocated probabilistically to different segments, and segment-specific choice models are estimated.</s>
          <s>At the same time, each segment is identified based on a multivariate set of exogenous variables.</s>
          <s>The approach limits the number of segments to a manageable number (relative to the combinatorial scheme realized in the first approach).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A further extension of this approach would be accommodating unobserved heterogeneity within the segment specific choice models employing random parameters or error component model structures (see Hess and Stathopoulos <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> ); thus subsuming the choice models from the second approach.</s>
          <s>Overall, the endogenous segmentation with segment level unobserved heterogeneity, offers an elegant alternative to address heterogeneity (observed and unobserved).</s>
          <s>In recent years, several studies have employed endogenous segmentation approaches (with or without unobserved heterogeneity) across different areas in transportation (for example, see <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The exact formulation of discrete choice models are a function of the decision rule employed.</s>
          <s>In traditional discrete choice models, the analyst generally assumes the same decision rule across the sample population.</s>
          <s>The predominantly adopted decision rule for developing discrete choice models is random utility maximization (RUM) that hypothesizes that decision makers, when faced with multiple alternatives with varying attributes, choose the alternative that provides them with the highest utility or satisfaction <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While random utility model formulations have served as the predominant decision rule for discrete choice models, there is growing recognition of their limitations.</s>
          <s>The implicit compensatory nature of the formulation allows for a poor performance on an attribute (such as travel time) to be compensated by a positive performance on another attribute (such as travel cost) <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In some choice occasions, such behavior is not realistic.</s>
          <s>In recent years, motivated by research in behavioral economics, there has been considerable interest in alternative decision rules for discrete choice models such as relative advantage maximization <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>Based on the aforementioned discussion, it is evident that homogeneity in both exogenous variable impact and decision rule restrict the flexibility offered by discrete choice models.</s>
          <s>In fact, the model parameters estimated with these restrictions are likely to be biased.</s>
          <s>While several research studies have focused on exogenous variable homogeneity, the decision rule homogeneity assumption has received less attention (for example see <ref type="bibr">Hess et al. and Boeri et al. [27,</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">28]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The current research contributes to our understanding regarding heterogeneity in discrete choice models with respect to both exogenous variables and decision rules.</s>
          <s>Specifically, the proposed latent segmentation based mixed models segment population to different classes with their own decision rules while also incorporating unobserved heterogeneity within the segment level models.</s>
          <s>In our analysis, we choose to consider both random utility and random regret theories.</s>
          <s>The random regret minimization approach has received wide application because of its mathematical similarity to the random utility approach and its intuitive appeal <ref type="bibr">[26,</ref>

            <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Hess et al., [27] a two-segment latent class model is proposed-one segment represented by random utility formulation and the other by random regret formulation.</s>
          <s>In our approach, instead of assuming the number of segments (as 2), we conduct an exhaustive exploration with multiple segments across the two decision rules.</s>
          <s>Further, within each segment, we also allow for unobserved heterogeneity.</s>
          <s>The reader would note that the estimation of latent class models become complex with increasing number of segments and presence of unobserved heterogeneity (see Sobhani et al. <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> for some discussion).</s>
          <s>The extensive modeling exercise is developed employing a stated preference data compiled to understand influence of air pollution exposure on bicycle route choice.</s>

          <s>Roadway characteristics.</s>
          <s>Grade, traffic volume, and roadway type variables influence route choice behavior in segments 2, 3 and 4. As expected, for commuting purposes, steep roadway grades reduce the likelihood of choosing the route in both utility (Segment 2) and regret (Segment 3) segments.</s>
          <s>In Segment 2, the coefficient indicates a reduction in utility for routes with steep grade.</s>
          <s>In Segment 3, commuter bicyclists will be predisposed to lower regret toward routes with flat or moderate grades relative to routes with steep grades.</s>
          <s>Cyclists are inclined to avoid steep grade presumably because of the discomfort from rigorous physical activity while commuting to work (see similar results in Sener et al. 46]).</s>
          <s>High vehicular traffic volume (medium and heavy) on roadway deters cyclists from choosing the route.</s>
          <s>In Segment 2, in particular, there is a larger drop in utility for routes with heavy traffic.</s>
          <s>The negative coefficients for heavy traffic volume in Segment 3 and Segment 4 suggest that regret reduces if traffic volume on the non-chosen alternatives is higher, thus reducing the likelihood for opting for route with heavy traffic (see similar result in Dill and Voros <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[62]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The presence of increased vehicular traffic will increase the probability of conflict between cyclists with motorized vehicles; so it is expected that commuter cyclists prefer routes with lower traffic levels.</s>
          <s>In terms of roadway type, routes on minor and major arterials (relative to routes on residential roads) are less likely to be chosen for commuting purpose.</s>
          <s>The effect is more pronounced in Segment 2, the utility for a route drops significantly when that route is located on a major arterial.</s>
          <s>In segment 3, the coefficient for major arterial is negative indicating that the regret associated with not choosing a route along major arterial is lower Decision rule heterogeneity in bicyclist route choice (relative to other alternatives).</s>
          <s>The results are quite intuitive and could be attributed to cyclist's perception of higher level of safety on residential streets.</s>
          <s>Bike route characteristics.</s>
          <s>The effect of bike route characteristics is found significant only in Segment 2 and Segment 3 -these two classes captured respondents who are highly sensitive to cycling infrastructure.</s>
          <s>The routes with continuous or segregated facilities are associated with higher utility in segment 2 and lower regret in segment 3 increasing the inclination to choose routes with continuous or segregated facilities relative to routes without continuous or segregated facilities.</s>
          <s>The results indicate that cyclists prefer to ride on a route with continuous cycling facility or on an exclusive route segregated from vehicular traffic with a slightly higher preference for exclusive routes.</s>

          <s>As expected, increase in mean exposure for a route reduces the likelihood that a bicyclist chooses the alternative.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, maximum exposure affects route choice behavior in segments 2, 3 and 4. The influence of maximum exposure is also along expected lines-increase in maximum exposure along the route reduces the probability of choosing that route (see <ref type="bibr">Anowar et al. [40]</ref> for similar results).</s>
          <s>The reader would note that between mean and maximum exposure, the influence of mean exposure is consistently larger than the influence of maximum exposure on a parts per billion basis.</s>
          <s>The higher negative coefficient for mean exposure level indicates that cyclists are more sensitive towards a constant level of pollution on a regular basis rather than instantaneous exposure to pollution.</s>
          <s>Trip characteristics.</s>
          <s>For commuters, travel time is an important determinant of route choice.</s>
          <s>The variable influences route choice decision in segments 2, 3 and 4.</s>
          <s>An increase in travel time is associated with reduction in utility or increase in regret for the route with longer travel time.</s>
          <s>Thus, that route have a lower probability of being chosen.</s>

          <s>However, Segment 3 and Segment 4 are random regret based classes.</s>
          <s>When all attributes in a model are evaluated using random regret decision rule, the calculation of trade-offs is done using the following equation <ref type="bibr">(Chorus,</ref>

          <s>where β t and β r are the estimated coefficients for the two attributes for which we are calculating the trade-off.</s>
          <s>In our case, the r th attribute is travel time and the t th attribute represents the attribute for which the "willingness to travel extra" for a one-unit increase/decrease is being investigated.</s>
          <s>The results from the trade-off exercise (for main effects only) are presented in <ref target="#tab_8" type="table">Table 6</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results of the trade-off analysis provides some interesting insights.</s>
          <s>For the utility oriented segment, as expected, cyclists are willing to travel 15-45 minutes extra to avoid steep grade, medium/heavy traffic volume, and riding on routes along minor/major arterial.</s>
          <s>Moreover, they are also willing to travel in excess of 25 minutes to ride on a continuous or exclusive bike facility.</s>
          <s>"Value of Clean Ride (VCR)" for mean exposure, was estimated as 1.16 min/ppb and for maximum exposure, was estimated as 0.68 min/ppb suggesting that commuter cyclists are more sensitive to mean exposure than maximum exposure.</s>
          <s>The value obtained in our current analysis is double the value we obtained in our previous analysis (see <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This signifies that Segment 2 commuter cyclists, who more likely to be females, are strongly sensitive to air pollution and are willing to travel 5-40 minutes extra to avoid them.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Trade-off values from random utility paradigm is insensitive to the changes in the attribute values.</s>
          <s>However, we can see from <ref target="#tab_8" type="table">Table 6</ref> that random regret formulation based trade-offs calculated for Segment 3 and 4 are alternative and choice set dependent and monotonically decrease with increase in travel time.</s>
          <s>For example, from trade-off values, we can see that when a chosen alternative does poorly in terms of roadway attribute (has steep grade, or has heavy vehicular traffic or is located on a major arterial), but has a faster commuting time, an increase in travel time leads to a small increase in regret while improvement in terms of road grade leads to a relatively large decrease in regret.</s>
          <s>Hence, cyclists are willing to travel more than 40, 20, and 35 minutes, respectively for travelling on a route with better grades (medium or flat), better traffic situation (medium or low), and convenient roadway type (minor or residential).</s>
          <s>Cyclists in Segment 4 are willing to travel longer than cyclists in Segment 3 to avoid heavy traffic.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the trade-off values in regret and utility based segments for roadway attributes are similar in magnitude; but values differ greatly for cycling infrastructure and exposure attributes, particularly for maximum exposure levels.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The Segment 3 and Segment 4 regret-based trade-off results might appear counter-intuitive on first glance.</s>
          <s>However, the reported results are a result of the construction of the RRM model.</s>
          <s>For alternatives with smaller travel times, any undesirable route feature (such as steep or high traffic volume) makes the alternative quite undesirable.</s>
          <s>Thus, individuals are willing to make larger trade-offs to avoid such features.</s>
          <s>The result is consistent across all attributes.</s>
          <s>At the lower end of travel time spectrum, the trade-off is quite high and drops as we move towards higher travel times.</s>
          <s>The result is analogous to the large shift in the "Value of Time (VoT)" values reported in Chorus <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[68]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In the extant literature, several approaches have been employed to address population homogeneity restriction in discrete choice models.</s>

          <s>Studies using latent class model have primarily focused on exogenous variable homogeneity; the decision rule homogeneity assumption has received less attention.</s>
          <s>Our study aims to bridge the gap in the literature in this context by analyzing population and decision rule heterogeneity simultaneously while drawing on a novel empirical contextimpact of air pollution on bicycle route choice.</s>

          <s>The model estimation is conducted using a stated preference data from 695 commuter cyclists compiled through a web-based survey.</s>
          <s>Model fit measures revealed that latent class models with four segments (3 random regret based segment-1 random utility based segment) provided the best data fit.</s>
          <s>The probabilistic allocation of respondents to different segments was achieved based on multivariate set of cyclist demographics and cycling habits.</s>
          <s>The results indicate that female commuter cyclists are more utility prone, however, the majority of the commuter cyclist's choice pattern is consistent with regret minimization mechanism.</s>
          <s>Overall, cyclists' route choice decisions are influenced by roadway attributes, cycling infrastructure availability, pollution exposure, and travel time.</s>
          <s>Although travel time is the most important attribute for commuter cyclists in their route choice decision, it is however, quite interesting that for one of the segments, travel time is not a factor.</s>
          <s>The results highlight the behavior of a small population group that is focused solely on reducing their exposure to air pollution.</s>
          <s>The discovery of their presence would not have been possible without the 4 segment latent segmentation model developed in our study.</s>
          <s>This observation has interesting policy implications-it suggests that bicyclists' exposure to air pollution should be incorporated in bicycle route planning.</s>
          <s>In addition, we find that between mean and maximum exposure, the influence of mean exposure is consistently larger than the influence of maximum exposure on a parts per billion basis.</s>
          <s>The higher negative coefficient for mean exposure level indicates that cyclists are more sensitive towards a constant level of pollution on a regular basis rather than instantaneous exposure to pollution.</s>
          <s>The analysis approach also allows us to investigate time based trade-offs across cyclists belonging to different classes.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, we observed that the trade-off values in regret and utility based segments for roadway attributes are similar in magnitude; but the values differ greatly for cycling infrastructure and exposure attributes, particularly for maximum exposure levels.</s>

        <figDesc>and route choice) is beyond the scope of the paper. Given the focus of our current study, we provide a concise summary of literature on route choice decision process for commuter cyclists (see Anowar et al. [40] for more details). For examining route choice, studies relied on both stated preference (SP) [41-48] and revealed preference (RP) survey data [49-53]. The most commonly employed analytical approaches to model route choice include binary logit (BL) or multinomial logit (MNL), mixed multinomial logit (MMNL), multinomial probit (MNP), and heuristic approaches. The important factors affecting route choice decision include socio-demographic characteristics, bike route characteristics, traffic characteristics, environmental attributes, access to facilities (such as showers at work place), and trip charac- teristics. Of these, the most significant factors are: travel time (lower is preferred)</figDesc>
        <table>Several research efforts have documented the potential 
increased exposure to air pollution for bicyclists owing to their close proximity to traffic, high 
respiration rates, and longer journeys [36-38]. Furthermore, there is growing evidence from 
health research studies highlighting the potential consequences of increased air pollution expo-
sure (for example see Weichenthal et al. [39]). Thus, there is need to explore the impact of air 
pollution exposure on bicycling choices. 
An exhaustive review of literature on bicycling related decisions (such as decision to cycle, 
frequency of cycling, , presence of 
incline (flat is preferred), bicycle infrastructure (continuous and exclusive/segregated routes 
are preferred), traffic volume (lower is preferred), and air pollution exposure (lower is pre-
ferred) [36, 40, 41, 43-47, 49, 50, 52, 54-56].
