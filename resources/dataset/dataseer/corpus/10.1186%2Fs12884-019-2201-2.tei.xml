            <s>Background: The role of men's participation in prenatal, delivery and postpartum care is very important, well defined and cannot be over emphasized.</s>
            <s>Very few studies exist about men's role in promoting the health of the mother and barriers to their participation in perinatal care in Iran; hence, the present study was conducted to determine the barriers to men's participation in perinatal care.</s>
            <s>Methods: The present qualitative study was carried out on 45 participants who were selected employing purposeful sampling technique.</s>
            <s>Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews, focused group discussions and field notes.</s>
            <s>Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis.</s>
            <s>Results: After data analysis, four main categories extracted were: "cultural barriers", "personal and interpersonal barriers", "health system-related barriers" and "socio-economic barriers".</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The results of this study, by presenting the barriers to and challenges for men's participation in perinatal care, could be helpful in designing culture-based strategies to overcome these barriers and improve men's participation.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>In women's life, reproductive period which include preconception, pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period, is a critical period; because, despite positive expectations for its outcomes, it might lead to disability or even death <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Men's participation during the perinatal period is of great importance in the health of the mother and the infant.</s>
          <s>According to previous studies, men's participation would decrease the rate of preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), restricted fetal growth, neonatal mortality and mother's stress and increase the rate of prenatal and postpartum care <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, men's participation in services related to the health of the mother and the infant would lead to early performance and completion of the prenatal care, improvement of mother's workload during pregnancy, preparation for delivery and improvement of the couple's relationship <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Men's participation in the healthcare services for mothers is a social and behavioral course of action that should be performed actively and responsibly to improve the health of the mother and the infant <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In most parts of the world, men are responsible for making important decisions regarding the allocation of financial resources and care behaviors that could directly affect the health of the mothers and the infants <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, men's behaviors would affect the reproductive health of their wife and children.</s>
          <s>However, most of the maternal and child health programs were focused on women's education and participation while men were neglected <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although in the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Egypt, 1994, and the Fourth World Conference on Women, the positive role of men in the health and reproductive rights of men was emphasized <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> and the importance of men's participation in maternal and child health services was approved by most of the countries; the rate of this participation was very low <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> and there were barriers to accomplishing this matter.</s>
          <s>According to the conducted studies, some of the recognized barriers were educational level, income, health center-related factors and low awareness about the role of men in reproductive health <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, factors such as perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward maternal health as a feminine duty would lead to poor participation of men in reproductive health <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Most countries have encountered challenges at executive levels in this field and more studies are required to determine the barriers and effective interventions for resolving them for improved men's participation.</s>
          <s>Also, in Iran, the level of men's participation in related issues to the maternal and fetal health is low and few studies were conducted regarding the causes for low participation of men and barriers to their participation.</s>
          <s>Thus, performing more studies in this field was necessary for designing culture sensitive and effective interventions on men's participation during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period.</s>
          <s>This could help to improve the health of the mother and the infant.</s>

          <s>Participants believed that the reasons for disapproval of men's presence by the healthcare providers in the feminine environment of prenatal clinics and labor rooms were due to disruption of health care providers' services, crowdedness of the clinics and shortage in healthcare staff for allocating sufficient time to men's education as well as religious attitudes toward confrontation of female healthcare staff with men.</s>

          <s>The present study was conducted to determine the barriers to men's participation in perinatal care.</s>
          <s>Results of the present study showed that the most important barriers to men's participation in perinatal care were cultural barriers, personal and interpersonal barriers, health system-related barriers and socio-economic barriers.</s>
          <s>In Iran, like most other countries, cultural barrier was one of the important and fundamental barriers to men's participation in perinatal care <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Participants mentioned gender roles, negative attitude toward men's participation, taboos and stigmas related to this issue in the society as the cultural barriers to men's participation in perinatal care.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that in the traditional context of Tabriz in Iran, gender roles are defined in a way that create the dividing line between feminine and masculine affairs.</s>
          <s>Women are responsible for home affairs and the care of the children and men for earning income for the management of life.</s>
          <s>Additionally, senior women (such as mother-in -law) in the families of Tabriz are considered as the main agents in care and guardians of women during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care.</s>
          <s>The acceptance of these cases by men causes that they do not react to barriers to their participation in perinatal care and do not attempt to eliminate it.</s>
          <s>Although today's men are more involved with perinatal care than in the past, they are still far from desirable.</s>
          <s>Results of the studies by Mortazavi &amp; Mirzaei <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> and Simbar et al. <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> showed that cultural barriers as the main hindrance to men's participation in perinatal care; which was similar to the results of the present study.</s>
          <s>Also a study in Cameron showed that tribal beliefs and traditional gender roles were the barriers to men's participation in prenatal care <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a report that was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 about the condition of the fathers in the world, social and cultural norms that would determine the roles of men and women was mentioned as a barrier to men's participation in maternal and neonatal health <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although some of the participants in the present study mentioned more participation of younger men than others in family matters, similar to a study that was conducted in Chile, the necessity of institutionalizing this participation during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period in the family and the society was also mentioned by the participants <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It seems that the type of family trainings for boys that promotes the authoritative role of men in life, as well as lack of education for men about their participation in the society, especially through the mass media, were important factors in this field; it is probable that by emphasizing on the positive role of men in perinatal care in the society through the mass media, religious and social leaders, their participation would be improved.</s>
          <s>In this regard, in Malawi, husbands who were listening to radio programs about this issue had more participation in pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care than those who did not listen to the radio programs <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Personal and interpersonal barriers were another barrier to men's participation in perinatal care; which was stated by participants as poverty in awareness, inadequate experience in men especially during the first pregnancy and communicational problems between the couples.</s>
          <s>A study showed that little knowledge of men and their lack of believe in the risks of pregnancy, were the barriers to their participation in prenatal care <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, A study in Myanmar showed that the existence of a positive correlation between men's participation and their level of knowledge about reproductive health <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other researchers in their study showed that despite men might not have knowledge and awareness about pregnancy and delivery; they could control the situation by making the right decisions at the time of emergency <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results of studies also showed personal factors, family and social relationships as the barriers to men's participation <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This might be due to lack of communication skills between the couples, replacing effective communication between family members with social networking technology, and lack of mutual understanding of each other's needs between the couples.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, traditional beliefs and concerns about risking the health of the mother and the fetus by having sexual intercourse during pregnancy and also wrong information provided by the healthcare staff, might lead to restraining sexual activities during pregnancy and after delivery; this might cause a distance between the couple which could lead to lack of participation by the husbands.</s>
          <s>It seems that conducting a consulting session at the beginning of the prenatal care and educating couples on the correct ways of communication and having sexual intercourse during pregnancy could increase men's participation by eliminating these barriers.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another barrier to men's participation in perinatal care that was emphasized by the participants was health system-related barriers.</s>
          <s>Similar to another studies <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> , in the present study structural problems of the health centers and the negative attitude of the female service providers toward men's participation in prenatal, delivery and postpartum care were the major setbacks.</s>
          <s>Also, lack of couple-friendly structures in centers for providing prenatal and labor services was one of the barriers by the health system to men's participation in perinatal care in the present study.</s>
          <s>A study showed that limitations of the health centers including limitations in personnel, space and attitude of the healthcare personnel toward men's participation were some of the barriers to men's participation in perinatal care <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Mortazavi &amp; Mirzaei in their study stated that inappropriate behavior of the healthcare personnel was a barrier to men's participation in perinatal care <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="bibr">Kaye et al.</ref> in Uganda considered the health system intimidating, unwelcoming and unsupportive and mentioned the health system factors as the essential factors for promoting men's participation in women's health issues during pregnancy and delivery <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it seems that existence of such barriers would even dissuade men who were intending to have an active role in their wife's care and to be present in the hospitals and clinics.</s>
          <s>Thus, changing the attitude of the healthcare personnel, welcoming the presence of men in the health centers and educating communicational skills to the healthcare personnel to make appropriate communication with husbands, could be the solutions to increase men's participation in perinatal care.</s>
          <s>Also, the modification of the physical structure of the clinics, such that patients could be examined privately along with their husbands, as well as modifying the structure of the labor wards, such that by maintaining the privacy of the mothers, husbands could be allowed in the labor ward too, could be helpful.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Regarding the policymaking and managerial problems, not officially recognizing the role of men in maternal and neonatal health, not paying attention to men's participation in perinatal care in the macro policies and programming of the Ministry of Health Medical Education and also not correctly performing the existing policies in this field were some of the barriers that were mentioned by the participants.</s>
          <s>A study showed that although many husbands, particularly in urban areas, go to the clinic with their wives, they are rarely included in any consultations <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31]</ref> ; Probably, signifying the role of fathers in the maternal and neonatal health and informing the public about their rights in this field could make this a public request and cause policy makers to think about designing a protocol in this field with focus on the role of fathers in maternal and neonatal health.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Socio-economic barriers were another barrier mentioned by the participants.</s>
          <s>All of the participants mentioned men's occupational problems and lack of sufficient time for accompanying the wife during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period, family's financial problems, high costs of pregnancy and delivery cares and not providing any financial support from the government for the families who are expecting or have children as barriers to men's participation in perinatal care.</s>
          <s>In a study men's occupational problem was mentioned as one of the barriers to their participation <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It seems that decreasing the costs of pregnancy and delivery cares and para-clinical measures during pregnancy and financial supports from the government for expecting families would cause more relief for men and provide an opportunity for their participation during perinatal care.</s>
          <s>Participants in the present study emphasized on not correctly applying the law of two-week leave for newly fathers in most of the offices and organizations.</s>
          <s>It seemed that supervising the appropriate implementation of the two-week leave law for newly fathers and considering a motivational system for encouraging the managers who appropriately implement the law and also fathers who use the two-week leave, could overcome this barrier.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Generalization of the findings in the present study, considering its qualitative approach, should be done cautiously.</s>
          <s>Although qualitative studies are not made for generalization of the results, they might be important for those who are willing to use the results of these studies and could be considered as a limitation.</s>
          <s>Therefore, through selection of participants with maximum variations, guidance and supervision of experts and external reviewing, the effort was to increase the accuracy and transferability of the data.</s>
