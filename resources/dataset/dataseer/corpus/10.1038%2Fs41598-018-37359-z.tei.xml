            <s>To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex.</s>

          <s>The ultimate goal of a speech neuroprosthesis is to create a direct communication pathway to the brain with the potential to benefit patients who have lost their ability to speak, which can result from a variety of clinical disorders leading to conditions such as locked-in syndrome <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>The acoustic representation of the stimulus that is used as the decoding target can significantly impact the quality and accuracy of reconstructed sounds.</s>

          <s>Using discrete units can be advantageous by allowing for discriminative training.</s>
          <s>However, decoding discrete representations of speech such as phonemes eliminates the paralinguistic information such as speaker features, emotion, and intonation.</s>
          <s>In comparison, reconstructing continuous speech provides the possibility of real-time, continuous feedback that can be delivered to the user to promote coadaptation of the subject and the BCI algorithm <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> for enhanced accuracy.</s>
          <s>A natural choice is to directly estimate the parameters of a speech synthesizer from neural data, but this has not been attempted previously because the process requires a highly accurate estimation of several vocoder parameters, which is hard to achieve with traditional machine-learning techniques.</s>

          <s>To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we aimed to increase the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech by combining recent advances in deep learning <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies.</s>

          <s>These models can improve reconstruction accuracy by imposing more complete constraints on the reconstructed audio by better modeling the statistical properties of the speech signal <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
          <s>At the same time, nonlinear regression can invert the nonlinearly encoded speech features in neural data <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>We examined the effect of three factors on the reconstruction accuracy: 1) the regression technique (linear regression versus nonlinear deep neural network), 2) the representation of the speech intended for reconstruction (auditory spectrogram versus speech vocoder parameters), and 3) the neural frequency range used for regression (low frequency versus high-gamma envelope) <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1A)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our results showed that a deep neural network model that uses all neural frequencies to directly estimate the parameters of a speech vocoder achieves the highest subjective and objective scores, both for intelligibility and the quality of reconstruction in a digit recognition task.</s>

          <s>Two types of regression models and two types of speech representations were used, resulting in four combinations: linear regression to auditory spectrogram (light blue), linear regression to vocoder (dark blue), DNN to auditory spectrogram, and DNN to vocoder (dark red).</s>
          <s>(B) The input to all models was a 300 ms sliding window containing both low frequency (LF) and the high-gamma envelope (HG).</s>
          <s>The DNN architecture consists of two modules: feature extraction and feature summation networks.</s>
          <s>Feature extraction for auditory spectrogram reconstruction was a fully connected neural network (FCN).</s>

          <s>(C) Vocoder parameters consist of spectral envelope, fundamental frequency (f0), voicing, and aperiodicity (total of 516 parameters).</s>
          <s>An autoencoder with a bottleneck layer was used to reduce the 516 vocoder parameters to 256.</s>
