          <s>Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating water-borne parasitic disease of humans and animals.</s>
          <s>It poses serious public health and veterinary concerns worldwide particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</s>
          <s>In humans, the disease affects nearly 218 million people in 78 countries with an estimated 200,000 deaths per year.</s>
          <s>Almost 95% of the infected people live in Africa <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Six species of schistosome are known to infect humans: Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, S. intercalatum and S. guineensis in Africa, and S. mekongi and S. japonicum in Asia <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Animals can be infected by 19 species of schistosomes of which five receive particular attention because of the associated infection severity observed in domestic ruminants in Africa (S. mattheei, S. bovis, S. curassoni) and in Asia (S. japonicum and S. mekongi) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Regarding livestock infections, it has been estimated that 165 million cattle are infected worldwide <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although human schistosomiasis is well monitored in most countries, bovine schistosomiasis receives negligible attention in comparison.</s>
          <s>In particular, the repartition, prevalence, intensity and transmission dynamics of livestock infections are poorly documented.</s>

          <s>For instance, the creation of the Diama Dam on the Senegal River has created a more stable flow of water, creating irrigation canals, rice-growing areas and water points for animals, leading to the emergence of new human and livestock schistosomiasis outbreaks <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Cameroon, creation of the Lagdo Dam on the Benoue River also increased the prevalence of human schistosomiasis <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> and in the same way, the deforestation of the Loum rainforest allowed the establishment of B. truncatus, the intermediate host of S. haematobium thus allowing its introgressive hybridization with S. guineensis (formerly known as S. intercalatum) <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Seasonal changes in cattle rearing methods in Africa (transhumance, nomadism) are important in the movement of domestic livestock, so animals can come into contact with multiple potential schistosomiasis transmission sites.</s>

          <s>The latter hybrid forms are particularly worrying because they theoretically could be enabling zoonotic transmission.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The four localities from which animals were screened in this study belong to the northern region of Cameroon which possesses 90% of Cameroon's cattle herds <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref> ) <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other intensive cattle breeding areas exist in the west and north-west regions; however, animals were not obtained from these regions.</s>
          <s>On average, we found that 19.5% of the inspected cows were infected (range 13.5-37.5%).</s>
          <s>This prevalence is much lower than that found by Ousseni in 1990 <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Such a difference might be at least partly explained by non-exclusive hypothetical factors including the slaughter season, or the age and welfare of the inspected animals.</s>
          <s>Indeed, all these parameters are known to influence infection prevalence in cows <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, we lack information to test these hypotheses.</s>
          <s>The sequence data indicate that all the infections were of pure S. bovis and we did not find any evidence of interspecific hybridization, consistent with the fact that S. haematobium × S. bovis hybrids have yet to be found in cattle <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, just like Webster et al. <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> , we did not inspect the veins bordering the urinary bladder of the cows, and so any potential S. haematobium or hybrid schistosomes may have been missed.</s>
          <s>The presence of S. haematobium × S. bovis hybrids in humans have been suspected in the northern region of Cameroon <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These data were based on an ITS2-RFLP molecular approach to identify hybrid profiles between S. haematobium and other species from the S. haematobium group; however, the resolution of this method is not high enough to distinguish S. bovis, S. mattheei, S. curassoni and S. guineensis.</s>
          <s>The authors hypothesized that these hybrids were S. haematobium × S. bovis hybrids, but because S. guineensis is also present in Cameroon and the ITS is identical for S. guineensis and S. bovis, the nature of these hybrids remains unclear <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Both the mitochondrial (cox1) and nuclear markers (microsatellites) indicated that most of the genetic variation observed among parasites is observed within and not between sampled animals.</s>
          <s>The factors influencing the genetic diversity of schistosomes were nicely depicted in the S. mansoni-Rattus rattus system on an island of Guadeloupe (West Indies) <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, co-infections by multiple genotypes released by intermediate host snails, the dispersal ability of larval forms of different genotypes, and the movement/dispersion of the definitive host all result in important genetic diversity at the infrapopulation level.</s>
          <s>In this regard, it has been proposed that the definitive hosts act as "genetic mixing bowls" for the parasites <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because this study is the first on S. bovis, only interspecific comparison with closely related species using relevant comparable markers can be performed.</s>
          <s>Previous studies using cox1 gene sequencing show a distinct pattern of genetic diversity according to the schistosome species concerned.</s>
          <s>At the scale of the African continent, the haplotype diversity (h) and the nucleotide diversity (Π) were 0.94 ± 0.0067 and 0.02553 <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref> and 0.36 ± 0.014 and 0.00434 <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively.</s>
          <s>Thus the two parameters converge with S. mansoni having both higher haplotype and nucleotide diversity than S. haematobium.</s>
          <s>Our study shows that S. bovis is more polymorphic than its sister species S. haematobium (based on both nuclear and mitochondrial markers) but also shows that the haplotype diversity is similar to that of S. mansoni (h = 0.961 ± 0.012) while the nucleotide diversity does not significantly differ from that of S. haematobium (Π = 0.00602).</s>
          <s>Moreover, we found that the Tajima's D* and Fu and Li's D* computed on our S. bovis dataset were significantly negative, which could constitute a signature of population demographic expansion <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results contrast with Tajima's D* estimates recently computed on both S. mansoni and Abbreviation: SE standard error S. haematobium in Yemen (both estimates did not differ from zero <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This major demographic difference between schistosomes associated with cattle or humans might be explained by the absence of or very few anthelminthic treatments in animals.</s>
          <s>Indeed, the increasing pressure of praziquantel treatments fortunately strongly affects the demographic dynamics and the genetic composition of human schistosome populations <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Whatever the method or the marker (mitochondrial or nuclear) used, we did not find any evidence for inter-or intrapopulation structuring despite considerable geographical distances separating the populations.</s>
          <s>This pattern clearly differs from that of S. mansoni for which populations are generally strongly genetically structured with high FST values even at small geographical scales.</s>
          <s>Such strong genetic structuring has been evidenced in several countries including Kenya <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref> , Brazil <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> , Uganda <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> , Ethiopia <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48]</ref> and Senegal <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Conversely, little is known on the genetic structuring of S. haematobium populations <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50,</ref>
            <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on a phylogeographic approach performed at the African continent scale, Webster et al. <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> revealed that S. haematobium <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> is poorly structured compared to S. mansoni <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several factors might explain the absence of genetic structure in S. bovis populations.</s>
          <s>First, as previously mentioned, the absence of anthelminthic treatments in cattle might foster the expansion of S. bovis populations.</s>
          <s>The effective population size for S. bovis is expected to be large enough to limit the effect of possible genetic drift and population differentiation.</s>
          <s>Secondly, host dispersal is known to promote parasite dispersion, which in turn might homogenize populations at the genetic level.</s>
          <s>Dispersion of S. bovis is mainly driven by cattle movements across the country through transhumance practices.</s>
          <s>Transhumance is a common practice where pastoralists move their livestock seasonally across different grazing lands <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[53]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While these movements are beneficial in terms of optimizing the use of land and other natural resources <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[54]</ref> , they also may play a role in disease transmission <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[55]</ref> and have other significant regional or local social/economic impacts <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">[56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The specific movement patterns of animals in conjunction with environmental conditions (wet versus dry and cold versus hot) could result in significant changes in whether transmission of infectious diseases is prevented or facilitated by movements <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Cameroon, transhumance occurs frequently between the drier northern and the humid southern regions.</s>
          <s>Indeed, livestock in this country are mainly assured by a group of pastoralists collectively called the Fulanis who practice transhumance as the pendular and seasonal movement of the herds and as their lifestyle.</s>
          <s>For that purpose, during the long dry seasons, these nomads move south with their herds to find more grazing sites and also for economic reasons.</s>
          <s>In fact, livestock farming in not routinely practiced in the south but is more common in the West and North West regions.</s>
