            <s>Bolus is commonly used in radiation therapy to improve radiation dose distribution to the target volume, but commercially available products do not always conform well to the patient surface.</s>
            <s>Tumor control may be compromised, particularly for superficial tumors, if bolus does not conform well and air gaps exist between the patient surface and the bolus.</s>
            <s>Threedimensional (3D) printing technology allows the creation of highly detailed, variable shaped objects, making it an attractive and affordable option for customized, patient-specific bolus creation.</s>
            <s>The use of 3D printing in the clinical setting remains limited.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the implications on time and clinical fit using a workflow for 3D printing of customized bolus in companion animals with spontaneous tumors treated with radiation therapy.</s>
            <s>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the time required to create a clinical 3D printed bolus.</s>
            <s>The secondary aims were to evaluate the clinical fit of the bolus and to verify the skin surface dose.</s>
            <s>Time to segmentation and 3D printing were documented, while the clinical fit of the bolus was assessed in comparison to the bolus created in the treatment planner.</s>
            <s>The mean and median time from segmentation to generation of 3D printed boluses was 6.15 h and 5.25 h, respectively.</s>
            <s>The 3D printed bolus was significantly less deviated from the planned bolus compared to the conventional bolus (p = 0.0078) with measured dose under the bolus within 5% agreement of expected dose in 88% of the measurements.</s>
            <s>Clinically acceptable 3D printed customized bolus was successfully created for treatment within one working day.</s>
            <s>The most significant impact on time is the 3D printing itself, which therefore has minimal implications on personnel and staffing.</s>
            <s>Quality assurance steps are recommended when implementing a 3D printing workflow to the radiotherapy clinic.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This is the first clinical study to document the clinical workload implications of 3D printing bolus material for use with routine radiation therapy cases.</s>
          <s>For all 14 cases included in the study, regardless of conformation or tumor location, 3D generated bolus was successfully generated and used for treatment within a 12 h window of time ( <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The greatest time factor in the workflow was the 3D printing, which does not involve direct human involvement for the vast majority of the time.</s>
          <s>Typically during the 3D printing process, the printer was observed while it performed pre-printing checks and printed the first layer to ensure proper operation of the printer.</s>
          <s>None of the print jobs failed during printing.</s>
          <s>In terms of human time required, the segmentation of the bolus took the greatest time.</s>
          <s>This time was spent between the clinician (JL) and the physicists (EE and DS).</s>
          <s>The clinician contoured bolus where it was needed for radiation planning to improve dose distribution; afterward the physicists would evaluate the bolus segmentation and modify it if necessary based on 3D printing considerations.</s>
          <s>Notably, the time required for bolus segmentation decreased as the individuals involved in the process gained experience, despite that this pilot study occurred over the course of only 14.5 months.</s>
          <s>The time requirement for this process was reduced to 0.5 hours for the last 5 cases.</s>
          <s>Likewise, the conversion of the bolus as a segmentation in a contouring software system to a 3D model in .stl</s>
          <s>format required less time with experience.</s>
          <s>For all cases, the time was 1.0 hours or less to perform this step and for cases that required greater than 0.5 hours, it was due to human error (i.e. an unintended hole in the bolus due to contouring on axial slices) that required revision of the bolus segmentation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As expected, the 3D printed bolus resulted in better mean surface deviation of the actual bolus location when referenced to the planned bolus compared to the conventional bolus.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig 3 demonstrates</ref> the extremes of the cases included, with the greatest and least mean surface deviation for conventional bolus.</s>
          <s>One reason for the large deviation in Case 7 is that the bolus was intended to conform to a highly irregular surface, specifically the maxilla and muzzle of a French bulldog.</s>
          <s>These brachycephalic breeds are characterized by short nasal cavities and abundant moveable skin folds that are challenging to recreate, and therefore to consistently fit a conventional bolus to their skin surface for repeated treatments.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the orientation of the patient and the desired location of the bolus did not allow for gravity to help keep the bolus in place spontaneously.</s>
          <s>The 3D printed bolus in this case performed clinically superiorly to the conventional bolus in part because it could help recreate skin folds and increase surface contact.</s>
          <s>While normal human anatomy may be more predictable and regular, superficial tumors may distort the skin surface in humans, thus this case illustrates a clear clinical scenario where 3D printed bolus improves treatment delivery.</s>
          <s>This may be particularly relevant when considering the need for posterior bolus in humans, as conventional bolus may fall during treatment and therefore not conform to the patient as desired.</s>
          <s>For bolus needed on lateral aspects of patients, bolus can help to recreate body curves and be secured in place with tape or anchored against an immobilization mattress.</s>
          <s>It has been demonstrated that air gaps of 10 mm can result in a 10% reduction in the surface dose for photons, but this may be less predictable for small fields treated with modulated fields.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25]</ref> Thus, 3D printed bolus may contribute dramatically to controlling tumors adjacent to the region of dose buildup.</s>
          <s>Importantly, the upgraded, larger extruder resulted in equal conformity for Cases 12-14, representing that once a workflow is established, it can be fluid as technology allows for modifications.</s>
          <s>Qualitative comparison of the bolus for Case 11, printed with both extrusion diameters, showed little difference in the spatial qualities of the bolus but a much faster time to production.</s>
          <s>Considering the typical resolution of a planning CT is on the order of mm, a submm change in nozzle diameter, while resulting in loss of printer resolution, does not seem to clinically affect the outcome of the bolus.</s>
          <s>Additionally, greater uniformity in bolus density with the larger extruder nozzle was noted <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">(Table 2)</ref> , which may affect quality control measures needed to assess each bolus for human use.</s>
          <s>It is clear that the greatest benefit of the larger extruder is the relevant impact on bolus generation.</s>
          <s>3D customized, patient-specific bolus could be generated with just a one-day turnaround time, thus could be used even for urgent cases.</s>
          <s>For example, Case 13 had a 222 cubic centimeter volume bolus and the total time to create the bolus was 4.5 hours (3.5 hours to print).</s>
          <s>Compared to the smaller nozzle extruder, which required 15 hours to print a 174 cubic centimeter bolus, the 1.2 mm nozzle extruder greatly reduces the overall time to generate a bolus.</s>
          <s>In human radiation oncology, a typical bolus will likely be of equal or larger size and volume than the largest boluses generated for the majority of cases in this study.</s>
          <s>A common bolus used for human treatments is 40 cm by 40 cm by 0.5 cm; at the build rates observed with the 1.2 mm extrusion nozzle, an equivalent size 3D printed bolus would be constructed in approximately 14 hours.</s>
          <s>Additional reduction in 3D print time may also be possible.</s>
          <s>A third bolus was generated for Case 11 with the 1.2 mm nozzle and a 1.2 mm layer height (rather than 0.6 mm) and the print time was further reduced to 1.7 hours.</s>
          <s>Compared to the other two boluses, no appreciable difference was seen in the density of the bolus (1.15 g cm <ref type="bibr">-3</ref> ) or CT in comparison of the boluses (mean surface deviation of 0.56 ± 0.36 mm); visually it was apparent the bolus was printed with a greater layer thickness.</s>
          <s>However, this additional bolus was not evaluated on the clinical cases presented here, but further investigation of 3D print time reduction is ongoing.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The printer settings used for bolus generation were based on the standard printer settings for nGen in the vendor supplied slicing software.</s>
          <s>The purpose of this was to assess whether staff with limited experience with 3D printing would be able to generate similar results.</s>
          <s>Modifications were designed to limit the use of support structures during 3D printing.</s>
          <s>Importantly, based on our study, the use of the generalized printer settings would not affect the outcome of the bolus conformity, suggesting minimal experience does not hinder adoption of 3D printing technology in most clinical settings.</s>
          <s>The financial implications for generating 3D printed bolus are modest following purchase of a printer; for example, the cost for 1 kg of the 3D printing material used in this study is $30 USD, which is sufficient to generate one 750 cm 3 bolus</s>

        <p>
          <s>(just under the volume of a 40 cm by 40 cm by 0.5 cm conventional bolus).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The printed densities ranged from 1.11 to 1.20 g cm <ref type="bibr">-3</ref> , a variation under 10%.</s>
          <s>The principle reason for this variability was the creation of small air voids within the bolus.</s>
          <s>As the plastic was printed, small air gaps can develop, even when 100% infill is specified at the outset.</s>
          <s>This can partially be compensated for with printer settings and choice of slicing software.</s>
          <s>However, special care should be taken when using 3D printed bolus in both planning and with clinical use.</s>
          <s>For example, if the bolus was assumed to have a 1.0 g cm <ref type="bibr">-3</ref> density in the treatment plan and the actual printed density of the bolus was 1.2 g cm <ref type="bibr">-3</ref> , a clinically relevant dose alteration could occur depending on the radiation modality and other planning parameters.</s>
          <s>Therefore, a clinical quality assurance program is required if 3D printed bolus is routinely used to ensure the 3D bolus performs as expected.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There were no significant differences between the expected and measured doses in this study, although it is important to recognize that clinical significance may not mirror statistical significance.</s>
          <s>Although toxicity was not an endpoint in this pilot study, unexpected toxicity did not develop in any case and all acute toxicities were predominantly resolved within 2-3 weeks of completion of treatment.</s>
          <s>A clear relationship was not identified between the difference between the measured dose difference and the 3D bolus conformity.</s>
          <s>For example, one case with the greatest mean surface deviation for the 3D printed bolus (Case 8) had better in vivo dosimetry agreement than a case with a lower mean surface deviation (Case 7; <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig 2A)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may in part be a reflection of the location of the in vivo dosimeters being on the skin surface rather than within the target volume, as they were highly prone to setup variability.</s>
          <s>One reason for the use of film was that it could be observed on even a small film if there was a high dose gradient on the dosimeter.</s>
          <s>Such information could not easily be determined from OSLD measurements.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is important to reflect on the number of available printing materials that may be purchased and combined in the generation of 3D printed materials.</s>
          <s>We elected to use PETG in particular because of its low economic impact, our familiarity with its use in our printer, the robustness of the plastic to resist damage if dropped, the ability to easily clean the bolus, and the ability to mark the plastic during treatment to improve repeatability of setup.</s>
          <s>None of the 3D printed boluses sustained damage during treatment; one bolus fell from the couch to the floor (approximate 3 foot fall) during a rapid anesthetic recovery but remained intact.</s>
          <s>It is feasible that a thin 3D printed bolus could undergo damage if dropped or stepped on, thus extra care may be needed for these patient-specific modifiers.</s>
          <s>Other materials may be more suitable under some circumstances-PETG is firm and unyielding and thus may be uncomfortable for some human patients.</s>
          <s>In veterinary radiation oncology, companion animals are anesthetized for treatment to ensure they are positioned properly and remain immobile during treatment.</s>
          <s>Comfort of the bolus is difficult to assess in veterinary patients; however, none of the dogs and cats treated had altered anesthetic parameters following placement of the bolus.</s>
          <s>Additional material may prove more suitable for some human patients and more work needs to be done to address the infill, dosimetry and toxicity implications of other materials intended for use in radiation oncology.</s>
          <s>The use of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) filament is attractive as it is a flexible plastic that can create elastic 3D printed materials that can be stretched but are not permanently deformed.</s>
          <s>Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is a firmer variant of TPE that has been of interest for radiation oncology and includes NinjaFlex (NinjaTek, Manheim, PA) and Cheetah (NinjaTek).</s>
          <s>It is important that additional research defines specific radiologic properties and ideal conditions for use so that these materials can be worked in to the workflow safely.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Limitations to the study include the small number of clinical patients investigated, the lack of dose verification under the conventional bolus, the lack of various thickness 3D printed bolus assessed, and that the time required to make conventional bolus was not accurately measured for comparison.</s>
          <s>It was not possible to fully assess the impact of time required to suitably select and adjust the conventional bolus used in this study due to the existing workflow in the veterinary clinic.</s>
          <s>The veterinary clinic reuses commercially available skinless bolus provided by the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Medical School following human treatment.</s>
          <s>The clinic therefore has a large collection of variably sized skinless bolus available for use that fits most animal cases and is selected and placed on the patient in under 5 minutes.</s>
          <s>For Case 8, in which wet gauze was used, it required approximately 3.5 minutes for the veterinary technician to build and confirm 0.5 cm thickness once wet.</s>
          <s>Comparing times could be evaluated in future studies, particularly in clinical scenarios where the same type of material is consistently used and standard sheets are shaped to suit the individual patient, as is done in many radiation clinics for patient use.</s>
