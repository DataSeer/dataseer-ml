            <s>Population size estimation is relevant to social and ecological sciences.</s>
            <s>Exhaustive manual counting, the density method and automated computer vision are some of the estimation methods that are currently used.</s>
            <s>Some of these methods may work in concrete cases but they do not provide a fast, efficient and unbiased estimation in general.</s>
            <s>Recently, the CountEm method, based on systematic sampling with a grid of quadrats, was proposed.</s>
            <s>It offers an unbiased estimation that can be applied to any population.</s>
            <s>However, choosing suitable grid parameters is sometimes cumbersome.</s>
            <s>Here we define a more intuitive grid parametrization, using initial number of quadrats and sampling fraction.</s>
            <s>A crowd counting dataset with 51 images and their corresponding, manually annotated position point patterns, are used to analyze the variation of the coefficient of error with respect to different parameter choices.</s>
            <s>Our Monte Carlo resampling results show that the error depends on the sample size and the number of nonempty quadrats, but not on the size of the target population.</s>
            <s>A procedure to choose suitable parameter values is described, and the expected coefficients of error are given.</s>
            <s>Counting about 100 particles in 30 nonempty quadrats usually yields coefficients of error below 10%.</s>

          <s>The traditional density method <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> is widely used by media, police and convention organizers for crowd size estimation, but the estimation usually ignores sampling and relies on imprecise visual estimation.</s>
          <s>Frequently, bird censuses also lean on visual estimation <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>

            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> that is slow, tedious and difficult to verify.</s>
          <s>Automated computer vision can work in some particular cases with regular patterns on homogeneous backgrounds and non-overlapping particles <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

          <s>However, automatic algorithms are generally biased and may show a poor performance <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>An unbiased population size estimation method (hereafter CountEm method) was recently proposed <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>CountEm can be applied to any kind of particle irrespective of population size and pattern (see for instance Figs 1 and 5 in <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The only practical limitation is the basic requirement that all the particles in the population should be unambiguously identifiable for manual counting in the considered image.</s>
          <s>It is based on well known principles of geometric sampling for stereology which have been previously applied to quantitative microscopy <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The main idea is to properly sample and count between 50 and 200 particles in order to estimate populations of any size and spatial distribution.</s>
          <s>Systematic sampling is performed with a uniform random (UR) grid of quadrats, see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1.</ref>
          </s>
          <s>The forbidden line rule <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> is used to avoid bias due to edge effects: a particle is counted only if it touches the quadrat but it does not hit the extended forbidden line of the quadrat (see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1C)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The population size estimator, b N , is the total number of sampled particles, times the sampling period.</s>
          <s>The precision of the method was tested <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> on two images with manually annotated particle positions, yielding planar point patterns e.g.</s>

          </s>
          <s>As the method is unbiased, the only source of error comes from sampling variance which can be estimated empirically via Monte Carlo resampling under identical conditions (see Section Simulation procedure).</s>
          <s>The empirical variance of the population size estimator was computed among 32 2 = 1024 Monte Carlo replications of the estimator for each given grid of quadrats.</s>
          <s>The empirical coefficient of error was in the 5% − 10% range, counting about 50 − 100 sampled particles for both point patterns of sizes 1120 and 4633 respectively.</s>

          <s>Choosing suitable parameters t and T in pixels, as suggested in our previous paper <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> , can sometimes be laborious.</s>
          <s>Two practical criteria were given <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> , namely aim at (i) having Q in the 50 − 150 range, and (ii) counting no more than 4 or 5 particles per quadrat.</s>
          <s>These two recommendations imply that the number of nonempty quadrats, n, may lie between 20 and 50.</s>
          <s>The resulting coefficient of error should be in the 5% − 10% range.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Consider an example in which the preceding criteria are fulfilled.</s>
          <s>The goal would be to estimate the number of particles N in the image, with coefficient of error below 10% using the old parametrization t, T. After choosing some initial parameters t and T, suppose that we count Q = 40 in n = 18 nonempty quadrats, with an estimated coefficient of error ceð b N Þ ¼ 15%.</s>
          <s>In order to reduce the error, we should increase Q and n since both are below the suggested ranges.</s>
          <s>But how should we proceed?</s>

          <s>Decreasing T to obtain more quadrats?</s>

        <p>

        <p>
          <s>CountEm describes an unbiased and efficient population size estimation method.</s>
          <s>It can be used irrespective of population size and pattern.</s>
          <s>It can be applied to humans, animals, or indeed to any kind of distinguishable particles.</s>
          <s>We have proposed new parameters to characterize the grid of quadrats, namely sampling fraction f, and initial number of quadrats, n 0 .</s>
          <s>A crowd counting data set containing 51 images and corresponding position point patterns have been used to analyze the suitable parameter values and the resulting coefficients of error.</s>
          <s>Population size has been shown to have no impact on the coefficient of error of the estimation, only sample size, Q, and number of nonempty quadrats, n, are relevant.</s>
          <s>Usually Q ≳ 100 and n ≳ 30, yield coefficients of error below 10%.</s>
          <s>The suitable parameter values depend on the order of magnitude of population size and spatial distribution.</s>
          <s>For the sizes and spatial distributions of our crowd counting dataset, n 0 = 100 and f = 0.04 are reasonable initial values.</s>
          <s>We believe that the reparametrization defined here allows a more intuitive and fast choice and/or adjustment of the working parameters.</s>

Fig 4 shows the approximately linear dependence of CEQ. Counting more than Q = 200 particles is not worthwhile in most cases. Fig 5 shows that doubling Q from 100 to 200 does only slightly reduce the error.</figDesc>
