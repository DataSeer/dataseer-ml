            <s>With this in mind, a thorough analysis of the Theory of Mind scale and the Faux Pas Recognition Test was conducted.</s>
            <s>Over 750 school-age (M age = 7.7) children with disabilities (mild intellectual disability, hearing impairment) and without disabilities took part in our study.</s>
            <s>The psychometric properties of measures in these groups of children were checked, using confirmatory item factor analysis, reliability, and validity analyses.</s>
            <s>Thanks to groups' invariance it was possible to compare mean results of children in the groups.</s>
            <s>Both measures showed well-fitted models with acceptable goodness of fit as well as scalar and strict invariance.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as an ability that "involves seeing oneself and others in terms of mental states-the desires, emotions, beliefs, intentions, and other inner experiences that result in and are manifested in human actions" ( <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , p. 655).</s>
          <s>ToM enables one to understand other's mental states, as well as their behaviors and the consequences of them.</s>
          <s>ToM is meaningful for cognitive abilities (e.g., <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> ) and important for social functioning, especially as it plays a role in peer relations and communication with people (e.g., <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> ), although the relationship between ToM and social functioning is circular: ToM influences social skills and social skills influence ToM development (e.g., <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>ToM emerges among typically developing children as well as among children with developmental disorders.</s>
          <s>However, among children with disabilities, such as those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), specific language impairment (SLI), intellectual disability (ID) and children with hearing impairment (HI), ToM is considered to be delayed or compromised (i.e., <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>in ToM development have negative consequences and constrict many aspects of everyday life, such as role play, imagination, and understanding emotions, jokes and joking, intentions etc. (e.g., <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>

            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>

            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22]</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A great number of studies show that ToM develops over the lifespan (e.g., <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, most of the research on ToM development has been conducted with children at the preschool age (e.g., <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27,</ref>

            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Although recent publications in the field highlight the need for extending the research beyond this age (e.g., <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>

            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34]</ref> ), there is still insufficient knowledge of ToM development in older children and adolescents.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Studies show that ToM depends on individual differences in factors such as language skills (e.g., <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> ), social skills (e.g., <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> ), and executive functions (e.g., <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> ), as well as on family characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status, parental mind-mindedness, and siblings) and the environment in which the child is nurtured (e.g., <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Cultural differences, such as individualistic (focused on development of individuals) vs. collectivistic (focused on development of society) societies <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> are also considered as factors that affect ToM development.</s>
          <s>In individualistic countries ToM develops faster than in collectivistic ones, and different aspects of ToM emerge in different orders in those cultures <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>

        <head>Measuring theory of mind</head>
        <p>
          <s>Analyzing the development of ToM requires using reliable scales and measures, as ToM is quite meaningful for children's functioning (e.g., <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Many different measures exist that were prepared at the very beginning of research into ToM development (e.g., <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">44]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Many others have appeared more recently (e.g., <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, in a great majority of studies only false belief tasks were implemented.</s>
          <s>These tasks are mainly focused on making predictions, understanding beliefs or predicting actions (e.g., <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, a result on a single task can be misleading and insufficient for understanding a child's actual ability level.</s>
          <s>Moreover, false belief understanding is just one of multiple aspects of ToM that emerge during the developmental span.</s>
          <s>Other aspects are also important, e.g.: diverse desires-understanding that people can have different desires about the same objects; diverse beliefs-understanding that people can have different thoughts about the same object; knowledge access-understanding that people can have limited access to knowledge; hidden emotions-understanding that internal emotions of people can be different than those shown outside; and understanding irony and idioms-understanding ambiguous situations, etc. (e.g., <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47,</ref>
            <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">48,</ref>
            <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Further, many tools assessing ToM development show unstable reliability (e.g., <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45,</ref>
            <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">50]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>There are also some doubts regarding the ecological (social) validity of the measures used most often <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29,</ref>
            <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These caveats highlight the need to find measures that address the limitations described above.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The Theory of Mind scale <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49]</ref> and Faux Pas Recognition Test <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> cover different aspects of ToM development, are quite popular and have been tested with children with and without disabilities.</s>
          <s>We decided, therefore, to use them to conduct a thorough analysis and for comparisons of ToM development in three diverse groups of children (with and without disabilities).</s>
          <s>It is important to know whether in groups of children with and without disabilities the psychometric properties of the tools are comparable, and thus whether ToM is comparably and accurately measured in diverse populations of children.</s>
          <s>It is a non-negligible issue, however, that the measures used to assess ToM development be universal, as they must be applicable to different populations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Theory of mind scale.</s>
          <s>The Theory of Mind scale was introduced by Wellman and Liu <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> and elaborated by Peterson and colleagues <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The scale consists of five tasks that concern: Tasks on the scale are ordered from the least difficult to the most difficult.</s>
          <s>The first two tasks are rather simple; results of previous studies show that even children as young as two years of age can solve them correctly.</s>
          <s>Subsequent tasks in the scale are more difficult.</s>
          <s>The last task concerns differentiating between feeling and showing emotions; thus, to solve the problem, children need to reason on a higher cognitive level.</s>
          <s>The results of studies show that children of primary-school age still have problems with solving this last task.</s>
          <s>Thus, the scale construction avoids "the ceiling effect."</s>
          <s>The scale has been used in studies with children without disabilities as well as children with disabilities, including ASD, intellectual disability, and HI (e.g., <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">44]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>It has been shown that children with disabilities develop ToM slower than their typically developing peers.</s>
          <s>Moreover, children with ASD follow a different pattern of answers in comparison to other groups of children <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Analyses by Wellman and Liu <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> and Peterson et al. <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> showed that the scale has good psychometric properties.</s>
          <s>It has been used in studies with children with ASD and with children with HI (native and late signers) in comparison to children without disabilities <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This revealed not only some differences in the level of performance among children (native signers having the highest score, late signers having the lowest) and a significant increase of performance observed with time, but also group differences in the sequence of the emergence of ToM understanding.</s>
          <s>While groups of children with hearing impairments and children without disabilities follow the pattern established in the previous study (DD&gt;DB&gt;KA&gt;FB&gt; HE; <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> ), children with ASD solve the hidden emotions task before the false belief task, which means a different order of development of some aspects of ToM in this group.</s>
          <s>Further studies have encompassed between-cultures comparisons.</s>
          <s>Children from Australia, Germany, Indonesia, and the US acquire ToM in the originally assumed sequence <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, children from Chinese and Iranian cultures develop knowledge access before diverse beliefs <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This disparity (as touched on above) has been explained in terms of differences between individualistic versus collectivistic cultures (e.g., <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In a study by Zhang, Shao, and Zhang <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> , the sequence noticed earlier for collectivistic cultures was reaffirmed for children without disabilities.</s>
          <s>However, for Chinese children with ASD, the pattern was similar to the ASD group from Western culture.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Faux Pas Recognition Test.</s>
          <s>The Faux Pas Recognition Test was introduced by Simon Baron-Cohen and colleagues <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It consists of 20 short stories, 10 of which contain a faux pas (where one of the characters behaves in an inappropriate way that causes embarrassment to another character).</s>
          <s>The person who committed the faux pas, however, does not realize that the behavior was inappropriate.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The story is acknowledged as understood when the child correctly answers all the questions asked.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the first study by Baron-Cohen et al. <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> , it was shown that typically developing children, aged 7-11, get better at dealing with faux pas with age, and that girls do better than boys.</s>
          <s>The ability to detect a faux pas was also examined in groups of children with Asperger Syndrome and with high-functioning autism.</s>
          <s>Results indicated that these children are significantly worse at recognizing faux pas in comparison to typically developing children, even if the comparison is conducted only with boys' results.</s>
          <s>When answers to stories without faux pas were also taken into consideration, it was shown that typically developing children and highfunctioning children with ASD solve these stories similarly and do not have major problems with them.</s>
          <s>However, the stories with faux pas, in general, were much more difficult than those without faux pas.</s>
          <s>At the same time, Baron-Cohen and colleagues assumed that stories within the same group (with/without faux pas) do not differ from each other in terms of difficulty.</s>

          <s>The current study has four main aims.</s>
          <s>First, we conduct psychometric analyses of both measures, using confirmatory item factor analysis, reliability and validity analyses, with results obtained from other ToM measures (Children's Social Understanding Scale, CSUS, <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> ), and on measures of social functioning and language skills in peer and school environments.</s>
          <s>Other analyses have shown that there is a strong connection between the development of ToM and social and language skills (e.g., <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6]</ref> ); children with higher social and language skills have better developed ToM.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Before beginning the study we adapted the measures for Polish.</s>
          <s>They were translated into Polish and then back-translated.</s>
          <s>The measures for children were checked by special education teachers to ensure that the content was understandable for children with developmental delays.</s>
          <s>However, it is worth noting that in the end no changes were made to words, order of information given, or sense of the terms, in comparison with the original English text.</s>
          <s>For each story from the Theory of Mind scale, as well as from the Faux Pas Recognition Test, we added attractive pictures to make the text easier to understand.</s>
          <s>It was important for children with disabilities to visualize the main point of the story.</s>
          <s>Such elements do not influence the results: a metaanalysis by Wellman, Cross, and Watson <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> showed that the way stories are presented (i.e., verbal, verbal with pictures, with real objects, with toys etc.) does not alter the findings.</s>
          <s>Before the current study we conducted a pilot study with 72 children: without disabilities, with MID, and with HI (N = 22, 20, and 30, respectively), age M = 7.2, SD = 1.06 (5.11-11.0).</s>
          <s>Children solved all tasks from the Theory of Mind scale, listened to all 20 stories from the Faux Pas Recognition Test, and answered questions.</s>
          <s>The pilot study role was only to check the measures, i.e., whether the tasks were understandable for children.</s>
          <s>Analysis of the ways in which children solved the tasks helped improve the Polish adaptation and translation of the measures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the current study, children solved the ToM tasks during an individual meeting in a separate, quiet room.</s>
          <s>The researchers are psychologists and educators, specially trained for conducting the study and possessing experience in working with children with diverse and special educational needs.</s>
          <s>The stories were presented to the children in the same order.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the case of the Theory of Mind scale, the order was arranged by results given by its authors <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To correctly solve the tasks from this scale, children needed to answer every question given in the task.</s>
          <s>Depending on the story, there were two to four questions (prepared by the authors of the measure).</s>
          <s>For every task done correctly, children received one point.</s>
          <s>For all five stories, children could receive 0 to 5 points.</s>
          <s>Higher results indicate better ToM development.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The analysis of the results of the pilot study showed that the stories from the Faux Pas Recognition Test vary in terms of difficulty, i.e., not only are the stories without faux pas-in most but not in all cases-easier than stories with faux pas, but there is also variation in difficulty among the stories with and without faux pas.</s>
          <s>As such, in the current study, we chose four stories (two with/two without faux pas), which, in the pilot study, were found to be difficult (over 70% incorrect answers in the pilot study); four stories (two with/two without faux pas) which were easy (over 70% correct answers); and two stories (one with/one without faux pas) with average difficulty level (~50% correct and incorrect answers).</s>
          <s>In total, children listened to 10 stories.</s>
          <s>The reasons for cutting down the original number of 20 stories were problems with perception and with focusing attention among children with disabilities.</s>
          <s>Solving all 20 stories turned out to be tiresome for children.</s>
          <s>The order of presenting the stories was: a story with faux pas followed by a story without faux pas, and the stories were mixed in the level of difficulty.</s>
          <s>To earn a point for a correctly solved story, children needed to answer four questions: (a) whether there was a faux pas behavior in the story, (b) who behaved like that, (c) why it was a faux pas (justification), and (d) whether the character's faux pas was made accidently (which is a condition for a faux pas behavior).</s>
          <s>Altogether, children could receive from 0 to 10 points on this test.</s>
          <s>A higher result indicates a better ability in accurate identification of faux pas.</s>

          <s>For the Faux Pas Recognition Test, we calculated the reliability (Cronbach's α) using tetrachoric correlation matrix for binary data.</s>
          <s>Studies show that Cronbach's α, based on Pearson's correlation matrix, "can be spuriously deflated with less than five scale points" ( <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[59]</ref> , p. 21).</s>
          <s>Hence, for binary data a better solution is to estimate α based on tetrachoric correlation matrix, thereby taking into account the nature of the data [59], 2. We conducted the confirmatory item factor analysis (factor loadings, item discriminations, and item difficulties) for all children and for separate groups, to see whether and how the measures fit in diverse populations.</s>
          <s>For the Faux Pas Recognition Test, we conducted separate analyses for stories with and without faux pas, as well as reliability analysis, 3. We conducted a between-groups invariance analysis, which enabled comparisons between groups.</s>
          <s>A measurement invariance is a critical assumption in every longitudinal or between-groups comparison <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[60]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Its aim is to verify an assumption that the observed result is independent from group belongingness (gender of participants) and depends only on the level of a studied construct <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[61,</ref>
            <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">62]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A lack of at least partial measurement invariance makes it impossible to interpret differences among a given model's parameters, among next waves of the study and/or between groups <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[63]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Researchers agree, for example, that a sense of comparison of differences between means must be based on at least partial scalar invariance <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">64,</ref>
            <ref target="#b64" type="bibr">65]</ref> , assuming that not only means of items (in the case of qualitative variables-thresholds) but also factor loadings do not differ significantly between groups <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[62]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, using composite scores (summed or averaged results) in analyses requires at least partial strict invariance.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To test measurement invariance we used a procedure of sequence estimation of series hierarchical nested models with a growing number of constraints.</s>
          <s>The first tested model was a configural model (M0), a model in which there is no assumption about invariance of a measurement tool among three analyzed groups (all parameters are tested as potentially independent from each other).</s>

          <s>In the third step we estimated a scalar model (M2), in which-apart from factor loadings-we also constrained thresholds of items.</s>
          <s>If a factor model is presented as a regression equation <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[66]</ref> , factor loadings are responsible for the slope of regression line of observed to latent result, and means of items (thresholds) show whether a center of latent variable in different groups is in the same place.</s>
          <s>As a consequence, a lack of equality of factors and/or means (thresholds) indicates a lack of a parallel between regression lines, and a need to reject a hypothesis that in analyzed groups the same observed result is connected with the same level of latent variable.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The next tested type of invariance was a strict invariance, which additionally assumes an approximate equality of residual errors in tested items.</s>

          <s>The strict invariance, therefore, is an indicator of between-groups reliability of measurement and implies at the same time that "group differences in manifest variable means and variances are accounted for by group differences in common factor means and dispersion matrices" ( <ref target="#b66" type="bibr">[67]</ref> , p.

        <p>
          <s>In the current study we conducted a psychometric analysis of two ToM measures-the Theory of Mind Scale and the Faux Pas Recognition Test.</s>
          <s>We were able to observe whether Polish children, with and without disabilities, follow the pattern of the Theory of Mind scale first shown by Wellman and Liu <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We also compared three groups of children-those without disabilities, those with MID, and those with HI-in terms of the level of ToM performance.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The analysis revealed that, for both measures, it is possible to show well-fitted models.</s>
          <s>Initial results left some room for improvement in the Theory of Mind scale; however, a small change, adding correlation between the first and second items of the scale, let us achieve satisfactory goodness of fit in all three groups.</s>
          <s>In the case of the Faux Pas Recognition Test, the models did not need any improvement; they were acceptable without any modifications.</s>
          <s>However, in the group of children with HI, the goodness of fit was the lowest, though still acceptable.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A very simple analysis of percentage of passed tasks, as well as much more robust IRT analysis, showed significant differences in the difficulty of the tasks.</s>
          <s>We have observed the same order of passing tasks as shown in previous analyses conducted in other countries, such as Australia, Germany, Indonesia, and the US <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although Poland represents a specific tension between being an individualistic society and having a considerably high level of power distance (according to which individuals in a society accept that power is not distributed equally) <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> , in the case of ToM development, it seems that it follows the pattern of individualistic, Western countries.</s>
          <s>However to confirm this result, it requires further analyses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The percentage of passed tasks shows that some of the faux pas stories not only differ from each other in their degree of difficulty; some of them are easier to pass than the tasks on the Theory of Mind scale.</s>
          <s>The result is at least different from Baron-Cohen and colleagues' analysis <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> , which showed that stories without faux pas are not always easier than those with faux pas.</s>
          <s>Rather, the results are very diverse: Some of the stories are much more difficult than others.</s>
          <s>Moreover, while Baron-Cohen and colleagues stated that most of the typically developing children, from 9 to 11, were able to pass all the control stories (without faux pas), this was not the case for the Polish children.</s>
          <s>The reasons for this may be similar to those in the case of the Theory of Mind scale.</s>
          <s>However, it is striking that some of the faux pas stories are easier to pass than those from the Theory of Mind scale.</s>
          <s>This is probably not because the recognition of faux pas is always more difficult than tasks on the scale, but, instead, because they demand paying attention to other details and aspects of the situation.</s>
          <s>As has been shown, the measures are moderately correlated, but they do not have the tendency to overlap, thus indicating some clear differences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In our study we were able to reach scalar and strict invariance for both measures, meaning that we could compare groups in the case of their Theory of Mind results.</s>
          <s>The analysis for both measures revealed that children without disabilities achieved highest results regardless of the measure.</s>
          <s>Children with MID displayed the lowest level of ToM development for both measures.</s>
          <s>Children with HI stood in between the remaining groups.</s>
          <s>The differences between children with and without disabilities were highly expected, as they have been reported in numerous previous analyses <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>

          <s>However, we were not certain about differences and their directions in the case of children with MID in comparison with HI, as groups of this kind had not been directly compared before.</s>
          <s>It is probable that the cognitive problems observed in children with MID are more restrictive in the case of taking perspective of others than the sensory problems experienced by children with HI experience, even though the relationship between ToM and intelligence is, at least, ambiguous (e.g., <ref target="#b69" type="bibr">[70,</ref>
            <ref target="#b70" type="bibr">71]</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The significant and positive correlations between ToM and social skills and language abilities support the well-established results from other studies (e.g., <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">39]</ref> ) about the role of these capabilities in ToM development.</s>

        <head>Limitations and conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Our study has a number of potential strengths.</s>
          <s>One is the relatively large sample of over 750 children.</s>
          <s>We showed the psychometric properties of two measures to assess ToM development using robust methods of analysis.</s>
          <s>Further, we were able to compare three different groups of children regarding ToM development within the Polish population of elementary school children.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Nevertheless, some limitations of the study should be mentioned.</s>
          <s>First, despite the well-fitted models obtained in our analysis, the reliability of the Faux Pas Recognition Test is not sufficiently strong to accept it without any doubts.</s>
          <s>Obviously, it is not critically low-for the entire group the measure reached the level of 0.70-however, there is still a need for improvement.</s>
          <s>The discussion about the reliability of the measures used for ToM assessment is a critical point in many papers.</s>
          <s>This is especially true when considering that results are not stable between studies and measures (e.g., <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Moreover, the measures used in our study for validity analysis are not the classic ones.</s>
          <s>For example, the Taxonomy of Social Problematic Situations for Children does not assess concrete social skills, but, rather, a tendency of the child to show unsuitable and socially disapproved behaviors.</s>
          <s>Other measures of social skills are self-report scales, which can raise doubts about the validity of the assessment.</s>
          <s>Taking these problems into account, we decided to use a few different measures of social skills and the sense of being integrated with peers, in line with the suggestions about the multi-method assessment of social skills (e.g., <ref target="#b71" type="bibr">[72]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, these measures turned out to be significantly-though not very strongly-correlated, showing at least some links between each other and between them and ToM.</s>
          <s>Linguistic abilities were also not measured in a standard way.</s>
          <s>However, the children seemed to be too old to use a test of receptive language prepared for preschool children.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, this test is not appropriate for some children with HI <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since all the children were at the same school education level, we decided to use a test of language knowledge that was appropriate for all children and also was easy to conduct with such a sample.</s>
          <s>In analyzing the results, it was also necessary to take into consideration the fact that children with special educational needs, even those with the same diagnosis or those seen as having a similar level of social and cognitive functioning, are diverse in the causes of their problems and delays.</s>
          <s>That is why individual results of each child can vary greatly from those of others.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Even taking into account the above caveats, the results are important not only for theory but also for educational and psychological practices, showing the value of the assessed measures not only in conducting studies with populations without disability, but also, and even primarily, with children with special educational needs.</s>
