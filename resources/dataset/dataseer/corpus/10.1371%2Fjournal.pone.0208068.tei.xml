        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Functional Connectivity (FC) is a widely used measure to quantify relationship between pairs of brain regions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is utilized to identify functional brain networks (fBNs) and is useful for understanding intrinsic functional organization of human brain <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, accurate construction of FC is one of the most essential tasks to understand the functioning of complex human brain.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Various analytical methods have been proposed for FC modeling from fMRI data such as Pearson correlation (CORR) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> and the partial correlation (PCORR) <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Pearson correlation (CORR) is the most-widely used method for characterizing FC between different brain regions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite its popularity, this method is limited because it reveals the pair-wise relationship between two regions without accounting for the influences of other brain regions <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, PCORR method, i.e., the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the inverse covariance matrix, only captures the pairwise information and therefore, does not fully reflect the interactions among multiple brain regions.</s>
          <s>To solve this problem, recent methods of estimating FC rely on linear relationships between all brain regions and delineate functional relationships by representing one region's representative time-series as a linear combination of other regions' time-series.</s>
          <s>These methods generally impose sparsity on FC coefficients because a brain region may directly interact with only a fewer other brain regions and thus, force insignificant connections to zero using the sparsity constraint <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, this solution may yield too sparse fBNs owing to division of actual fBNs into smaller communities and hence, does not guarantee extraction of accurate communities or fBNs.</s>
          <s>Thus, sparsity constraint alone may not capture the modular structure of brain regions belonging to the same community.</s>
          <s>To address this problem, some previous studies employed both sparse and dense constraints to characterize FC <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is observed that sparsity constraint helps in extracting sparse inter-network connections and denseness helps in extracting dense intra-network connections.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Apart from considering sparsity and denseness constraints, an informative FC graph is essentially low rank <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , which implies that columns and rows of FC are lying in the lower dimensional space, where rows and columns signify brain regions.</s>
          <s>Low rank constraint provides a modular structure to fBNs, which is closer to the actual real fBNs <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, none of the existing methods of estimating FC utilize low-rank assumption in the formulation.</s>
          <s>Inspired by this insight, we propose a new multivariate method for learning FC matrix with an assumption that this matrix is reasonably low rank.</s>
          <s>In addition, we also impose sparsity constraint to learn sparse fBNs as has been explored in the previous studies <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The proposed method is formulated as a convex minimization problem with l 1 -norm (via sparsity convex surrogate) and nuclear norm (via low rank convex surrogate) constraints.</s>
          <s>We name the proposed method as Low-Rank Multivariate Vector Regression-based Connectivity (LR-MVRC).</s>
          <s>We utilize popular Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for solving the newly proposed objective function because it is widely used for solving joint l 1 and nuclear norm problems in different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Second contribution of the proposed work is the identification of overlapping communities.</s>
          <s>In specific, communities are a group of tightly interconnected brain regions forming functional brain networks.</s>
          <s>Overlapping communities imply that one brain region might be involved in multiple communities.</s>
          <s>This sounds plausible because one stimulus, say auditory, may stimulate memory and other functional networks apart from the auditory network.</s>
          <s>This indicates a need for identifying overlapping communities compared to the commonly identified disjoint communities <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A few recent studies in fMRI have indicated the existence of overlapping brain communities, for example, popular Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method in fMRI results in overlapping set of clusters <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, a few recent studies based on functional connectivity indeed indicate overlap among various functional brain networks and suggest that brain regions may belong to several communities simultaneously <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although several efforts have been made in this direction, the overlapping community structure of brain networks are still largely unclear.</s>
          <s>Most of these studies are based on matrix factorization approaches to represent FC matrix into lower dimensional space of size K (i.e.</s>
          <s>number of communities), where each one of the K dimensions of this space represents association of various brain regions to the corresponding community.</s>
          <s>Existing methods largely impose external sparsity constraint on this lower dimension space so as to make community inference easy from the perspective of fBNs.</s>
          <s>However, it is still unclear whether this type of network inference is actually sparse or dense.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another issue of the existing methods is the utilization of CORR method to build FC, followed by, thresholding on CORR values to retain only a few top connections of FC matrix.</s>
          <s>This may not be a reasonable assumption.</s>
          <s>In this work, we utilize full FC matrix to detect overlapping community structure without using any predefined threshold value.</s>
          <s>In addition, we utilize conventional matrix factorization approach to obtain overlapping fBNs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Owing to non-negative FC matrix obtained with LR-MVRC, we utilize non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach without imposing any external sparsity constraint.</s>
          <s>NMF is a popular unsupervised machine learning matrix factorization approach <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been widely used to obtain overlapping communities, especially, in the social networks <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This method has also been applied to neuroimaging data to localize co-varying structural brain regions <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> , to characterize brain tumor heterogeneity <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , and to reveal altered default mode network in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this paper, NMF is used to obtain overlapping communities or fBNs using fMRI data.</s>
          <s>The non-negativity property retained in NMF is crucial since the interpretation of results becomes straightforward.</s>
          <s>We utilize publicly available 1000 Functional Connectomes Project resting state fMRI data to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting fBNs on a group of subjects.</s>
          <s>Please note that fBNs and communities words are used interchangeably from now onwards.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Salient contributions of the proposed work are as follows:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1. We propose a novel multivariate method for computing FC with sparsity and low-rank constraints.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>2. We extract overlapping communities in contrast to non-overlapping communities extracted in general.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To validate the proposed work, it is compared with two state-of-the-art network-based community detection methods: modularity optimization and independent component analysis (ICA).</s>

          <s>Parameter K is the number of communities in the NMF method.</s>
          <s>On varying the value of K, different fBN structures/communities are observed.</s>
          <s>Increasing the number K allows us to represent more and more functional communities formed in the brain (refer to <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">Table 2</ref> with K = 15).</s>
          <s>However, as the number of communities increases, we move from underfitting to overfitting community structures, i.e., we face the trade-off between approximating complex brain structures and overfitting them, potentially capturing noise or redundant brain networks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>By starting with a large K (say 15, which is possibly double the number of communities in human brain), the effect of considering a higher number of communities can be accounted by ignoring redundant number of communities that correspond to similar fBNs.</s>

            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a matter of fact, CORR method which exists for FC estimation for almost two decades, considers a pair of two regions while studying functional connection between them.</s>
          <s>However, this pairwise relationships only reflects the second-order relationships between brain regions without accounting for highorder relationships which is crucial for understanding complex brain networks architecture.</s>
          <s>To this end, the proposed multivariate method considers all regions simultaneously and regresses one region's time series onto all other regions' time series and hence, is named as multivariate regression framework.</s>
          <s>In addition, besides identifying non-overlapping fBNs, we In this paper, we adopted region parcellation and numbering corresponding to the 90 AAL ROIs for the definition of nodes and subsequent construction of fBNs.</s>
          <s>Multiple studies in fMRI have utilized different node definitions by using clustering or ICA-based methods.</s>
          <s>The nodes in these studies mainly include the default mode, cognitive control, visual, auditory, subcortical and bilateral limbic networks, which are largely in accordance with the communities identified by LR-MVRC method in this paper.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>More importantly, the overlapping communities derived by LR-MVRC with NMF are neuro-physiologically meaningful and comparable to the communities derived using the other most famous modularity optimization methods in the fMRI literature.</s>
          <s>On visualizing results, we observe that most communities detected by NMF on LR-MVRC FC matrix also appear in the results derived by modularity optimization.</s>
          <s>However, the most prominent difference is that NMF is able to capture more realistic communities because it allows overlapping communities, say, in default mode, subcortical, bilateral limbic and visual networks.</s>
          <s>In particular, the identified overlapping regions are mostly found to be the part of frontal, parietal, and temporal brain regions.</s>
          <s>Similar findings have been previously reported in a few recent studies <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[48,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The overlapping community structure explored by the proposed method can result in a better understanding of the group-level functional brain networks.</s>
          <s>However, capturing and analysis of individual subject's differences could be more useful in understanding individual brain architecture.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A limitation of NMF method is that the performance of NMF depends on its initialization of K to some extent.</s>
          <s>In this paper, the value of K in NMF algorithm is initialized based on our prior knowledge of the number of fBNs.</s>
          <s>Although this is the most popular and simple initialization strategy for NMF methods, it is still a constraint of this algorithm compared to the conventional community detection methods, such as modularity optimization, that do not require any pre-specified K.</s>
          <s>These alternative strategies may lead to faster convergence of the algorithm.</s>
          <s>Thus, there should be an attempt to auto-detect the number of communities K in NMF algorithm.</s>

          <s>However, this approach does not provide a clear node membership to each overlapping community.</s>
          <s>Therefore, methods accounting for crisp partitions, allowing each nodes' contribution to multiple communities are required to be considered in the future works.</s>
          <s>A few studies have attempted to consider this <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[53,</ref>
            <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">54]</ref> , although these methods do not provide information about nodes' membership to each community.</s>
          <s>Owing to this, more sophisticated methods that combine the advantages of both the above mentioned approaches can provide more useful information about the fBNs architecture <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In this work, we propose a Low Rank Multivariate Vector Regression-based Connectivity (LR-MVRC) method for estimating FC matrix.</s>
          <s>Proposed method utilizes both sparsity and low rank constraints while estimating the FC matrix.</s>
          <s>Most of the previous studies extract disjoint communities or functional brain networks, we extract overlapping communities via NMF that may be biologically more correct for understanding human brain's functional organization.</s>
          <s>Experimental results suggest that the proposed framework can better characterize the brain networks' organization at the group level.</s>
          <s>In conclusion, we believe that the proposed method and its potential applications could provide new insights into the functional networks' organization of the human brain.</s>

Experimental results show that the proposed framework is capable of identifying underly- ing overlapping fBN organization of the human brain. We observe that the proposed method results in multiple fBNs such as Visual Network (VN), Somato-motor Network (SMN), Auditory Network (AN), Cognitive Control Network (CCN), Motor Network (MN), Sub- cortical Network (SCN), and Default Mode Network (DMN).
