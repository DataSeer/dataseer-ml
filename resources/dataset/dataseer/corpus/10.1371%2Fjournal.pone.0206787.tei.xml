            <s>Here we ask whether this model, when calibrated with data from natural plant communities, can predict the abundances of five dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis, Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana, and Poa fendleriana) in a greenhouse experiment that manipulated light and soil properties.</s>
            <s>To address this question, we used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model community-weighted mean (CWM) seed mass, mean Julian flowering date, and specific root length (SRL) as non-linear functions of two environmental variables (soil pH and pine basal area) in natural vegetation.</s>
            <s>The model-fitted CWM traits were then used as constraints in the CATS model to predict the relative abundance of the five grass species that were seeded in a mixture at equal densities into a 2×2 factorial experiment with soil parent material and light level as crossed factors.</s>
            <s>Light was the most important factor influencing seedling community composition, especially the abundances of Bouteloua gracilis and Poa fendleriana.</s>
            <s>The model-predicted relative abundances were significantly correlated with the observed relative abundances, and the model accurately predicted the dominant species in every treatment.</s>
            <s>P. fendleriana was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in both shade treatments and the sunbasalt treatment, and B. gracilis was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in the sun-limestone treatment.</s>
            <s>Our results provide experimental evidence that environmental filtering of the species pool occurs in the early stages of community assembly (including germination, emergence, and early growth), and that trait-based models calibrated with data from natural plant communities can be used to predict the outcome of the early stages of community assembly under experimental conditions.</s>

          <s>Second, the trait-based CATS model can produce predictions that are significantly correlated with observations under experimental conditions that are independent from the locations in which the model was calibrated, but accuracy varied among species and treatment combinations.</s>

          <s>On small spatial scales, where species are not limited by dispersal, the community assembly process reflects the influence of environmental filters and biotic interactions <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While many important processes control the assembly of species (i.e., dispersal limitation, demographic stochasticity, positive and negative species interactions, disturbance), this study isolated the early stages of germination, emergence, and early growth while eliminating the possibility of dispersal limitation.</s>
          <s>Nearly 100% of the individual seedlings that germinated survived until the end of the experiment.</s>
          <s>Yet species differed strongly in their germination and emergence rates, indicating that the environmental conditions affecting seed germination and emergence were important filters influencing the assembly of the experimental communities.</s>
          <s>A substantial amount of research documents the importance of light in the germination and emergence phases of plant development.</s>
          <s>The primary mechanism relates to how plants respond to changes in the spectral ratio of red and far-red light <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This mechanism has been shown to be more important for smaller seeded species suggesting an increased sensitivity to microsite availability related to shading and competition <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47,</ref>
            <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">48]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This likely relates to an increased risk of mortality for smaller seeded species compared to larger seeded species when subject to post germination hazards and the need to optimize resource acquisition <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Light was not a significant factor for the larger seeded species in our study, E. elymoides and F. arizonica, suggesting a capacity to utilize seed reserves that allowed them to occupy a wider range of microsites as well as buffer post-germination hazards.</s>
          <s>Previous research also documents that this response is species-specific, which agrees with our findings <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example, Trait-based model predicts species abundances under experimental conditions while both P. fendleriana, and B. gracilis have small seeds and showed a significant response to the light treatment in our experiment, M. montana, the species with the smallest seed mass did not.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the experimental treatments had no significant effect on observed CWM seed mass, indicating that seed mass does not have clear predictable effects on germination, emergence, and early growth across the range of environmental conditions studied here.</s>

          <s>Full sun treatments reflect high resource environments, which have been shown to select for species that tend to have high SRL and later flowering dates <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In addition, P. fendleriana, a C 3 species with low SRL, and an early flowering date performed nearly as well as B. gracilis in these treatments, suggesting that in high resource environments these traits do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage during early stages of community assembly.</s>
          <s>In contrast, shade treatments reflect resource-poor environments, so species with traits that confer an ability to tolerate low light levels would be expected to be dominant <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[51,</ref>

          <s>Decreases in light availability associated with increased ponderosa pine density has been correlated with a shift in understory community composition towards species exhibiting whole-plant shade tolerant strategies associated with low SRL and earlier flowering times <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Flowering date relates to the phenology of life history events and exhibits pleiotropy with germination and emergence in some species <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36,</ref>
            <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">53]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Specifically, the major flowering time gene Flowering Locus C (FLC) has been shown to regulate temperature dependent germination and emergence <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Flowering date differs most between the C 3 and C 4 species in our study and all three C 3 species tended to be more abundant in shaded treatments.</s>
          <s>While we do not not know the degree of FLC expression among these species it suggests a possible mechanism for this finding.</s>
          <s>Earlier germination and emergence can also provide a competitive advantage, enabling plants to reach a larger size before reproduction, thereby increasing fecundity <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[54]</ref> ).</s>

          <s>Higher CWM SRL and flowering dates in sun versus shade is also consistent with the trait-environment relationships shown in the fitted GAMs, which reflect the observed trait distributions in the natural plant communities.</s>
          <s>This is important because the CATS model, despite the imperfect prediction of CWM traits in the experiment, still yielded reasonable predictions of species relative abundances.</s>
          <s>In this case, the agreement found between observed and predicted CWM trait values in at least one treatment for each trait compensated for poorer CWM trait predictions elsewhere and their influence on CATS model predictions of relative abundances.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Predictive accuracy can also be attributed to several factors related to CATS model constraints and the experimental environment.</s>
          <s>Similarity in trait values among species in a given community has been shown to decrease the predictive accuracy of the CATS model <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Greater similarity in trait values can increase the number of feasible solutions to the system of linear equations, so there would be a larger set of distributions that agree with the constraints.</s>
          <s>While these species represent a broad range of trait values among grass species in this ecosystem, their range of traits with respect to other understory species (e.g., legumes, annual forbs, etc.) is restricted.</s>
          <s>Also, our measure of relative abundances based on density might be sufficiently distinct from the visual estimates of cover that were used to calibrate the trait-environment relationships to impact CATS model predictions.</s>
          <s>It cannot be overlooked that the CWM traits used as constraints to predict the relative abundance of our five grass species were predicted from field data.</s>
          <s>So, while we assume that similar traits will manifest in similar environments, differences in soil pH and light availability across each of our experimental communities likely represented sufficiently different environments from those natural communities in which CWM traits were estimated.</s>
          <s>Measuring soil pH in each experimental community might have allowed for more precise predictions, rather than using mean values that were calculated from field data throughout the region.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The validity of any scientific theory rests in its ability to make accurate and generalizable predictions <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[55]</ref> .</s>
          <s>By providing quantitative predictions of the relative abundances of individual species in a community, the CATS model can be used to directly test the theoretical framework of trait-based community assembly through environmental filtering.</s>
          <s>Our results provide evidence that environmental filtering and species sorting occurs in the phases of germination, emergence, and early growth, and that trait-based models can predict the outcome of these early stages of community assembly under experimental conditions.</s>
