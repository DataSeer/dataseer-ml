            <s>The screening (by direct PFU count) and quantification (by quantitative PCR) of the phage in bee organs and in larvae after ingestion allowed us to conclude that despite 10 4 phages reaching larvae only an average of 32 were available to control the spread of the disease.</s>

          <s>However, as discussed above, RJ contains factors that inactivate phages within a 3 hours period.</s>

        <figDesc>T7 phage was gently provided by J. Molineux (University of Texas), and T1 and T4 phages by Stan Brouns (Delft University of Technology). Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C overnight (O/N) in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, VWR) or Tryptic Soy Agar medium (TSA; TSB containing 1.5% (w/v) agar, NZYTech). For phage propagation, 5 μL of phage suspension were spread evenly on host bacterial lawns using a paper strip and incubated O/N at 37 °C. Then, 3 mL of SM Buffer (5.8 g.L −1 NaCl, 2 g.L −1 MgSO 4 .7H 2 O, 50 mL.L −1 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, VWR) were added to each plate and re-incubated O/N at 4 °C with gentle stirring (50 rpm on a PSU-10i Orbital Shaker (BIOSAN)). The floating liquid was collected, centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 × g, 4 °C), and purified with 1:4 (v/v) chloroform followed by filter sterilization (PES, GE Healthcare, 0.2 μm). Phage suspension were stored at 4 °C until use.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>were designed using SnapGene ™ software (version 1.1.3) (www.snapgene.com).The DNA was purified from the previously homogenised samples of H&amp;T, Abd, larvae and from diluted RJ. Before DNA extraction, samples were supplemented with 25 ng.µL −1 of the IAC template (a 3075 bp purified amplicon originary from E. coli LacZ gene). Zymo Quick-DNA ™ Viral Kit was used for DNA purification, with some modifications relatively to the manufacturer instructions: a 3 hours period of incubation with the supplied Lysis Buffer and the elution in 15 µL of the supplied Storage Buffer.T7 phage quantification in bees and larva. In order to quantify the IAC concentration present in the purified DNA, a standard curve was obtained (Cq IAC = −3.781 × Log [IAC] (ng.µL −1 ) + 8.369 (Cq = quantification cycle)) using several concentrations of the LacZ amplicon (5.5, 0.55, 0.11, 0.055 ng.µL −1 ). For that 5 µL of SsoFast ™ EvaGreen (BioRad), 2 µL of DNA template, 1 µL of a 5 µM LacZ (IAC) primer mix and HyPure TM Molecular Biology Grade water (GE, Healthcare) up to 10 µL were mixed and run for 3 minutes at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 10 seconds at 95 °C, 10 seconds at 58 °C, and 10 seconds at 65 °C (the melt curve was generated by heating from 65 to 95 °C with increments of 1 °C, 5 seconds dwell time).</figDesc>

        <figDesc>To assess the amplification efficiency of the primer pair T7 MCP another standard curve was defined: Cq MCP = −3.486 × Log [T7 MCP] (ng.µL −1 )+11.467). T7 phage commercial DNA (BIORON) serial dilutions (0.3; 0.1; 0.03; 0.01 ng.µL −1 ) were used as template for the qPCR reaction mixture. The annealing temperature, in this case was 54 °C.In order to estimate T7 phage concentration (PFU.mL −1 ) in the treated samples, the DNA of five serial dilutions of a 10 8 PFU.mL −1 T7-phage suspension was purified (Zymo Quick-DNA ™ Viral Kit), and used as template for qPCR analysis (T7 MCP primers). The standard curve equation was obtained<ref target="#b1" type="bibr">(2)</ref>. A negative control using HyPure TM water was included in each reaction and three replicates of each condition were analysed in all the assays.Table 1.
