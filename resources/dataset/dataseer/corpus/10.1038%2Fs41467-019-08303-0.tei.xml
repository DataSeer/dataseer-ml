            <s>The structure and distribution of genomic diversity in natural microbial communities is largely unexplored.</s>
            <s>Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to assess the diversity of the honey bee gut microbiota, a community consisting of few bacterial phylotypes.</s>
            <s>Our results show that most phylotypes are composed of sequence-discrete populations, which co-exist in individual bees and show age-specific abundance profiles.</s>
            <s>In contrast, strains present within these sequence-discrete populations were found to segregate into individual bees.</s>
            <s>Consequently, despite a conserved phylotype composition, each honey bee harbors a distinct community at the functional level.</s>
            <s>While ecological differentiation seems to facilitate coexistence at higher taxonomic levels, our findings suggest that, at the level of strains, priority effects during community assembly result in individualized profiles, despite the social lifestyle of the host.</s>
            <s>Our study underscores the need to move beyond phylotype-level characterizations to understand the function of this community, and illustrates its potential for strain-level analysis.</s>

          <s>First of all, the same divergence in the 16S rRNA sequence can correspond to vastly different levels of relatedness at the genomic level, even within the same bacterial species <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>

          <s>Secondly, adaptation of bacterial populations to specific environmental conditions is often linked to functions in the accessory gene pool, which cannot be inferred from amplicon sequencing data <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> .</s>

          <s>To this end, we established a DNA extraction protocol that allowed for the enrichment of bacterial cells in samples originating from single homogenized bee guts (hindgut), and constructed a reference genome database containing genomic data for all major phylotypes of the honey bee gut microbiota <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The enrichment protocol efficiently reduced host-derived DNA in most samples, with an average of 13% of the reads mapping to the honey bee genome (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover,~90% of the remaining reads mapped to the reference genome database in the majority of samples, regardless of honey bee age, indicating that the current database is representative of most of the community ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 2b</ref> ).</s>
          <s>One sample (DrY2_W5) did contain an abnormal amount of unmapped non-host reads (71%), and was therefore removed from all downstream analyses related to the core microbiota composition and distribution.</s>

          <s>To identify bacterial lineages not represented in the current database, orthologs of 33 universally conserved gene families <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> were extracted from de novo assemblies of non-host reads, and the subset of these sequences without a close hit to the current genomic database (&lt;95% nucleotide sequence identity) was further analyzed.</s>
          <s>The median number of such orthologs per gene family ranged from 0-3 per sample, indicating that relatively few additional taxa were present with sufficient coverage for assembly in a given sample (Supplementary Data 2).</s>
          <s>A blast search against the NCBI non-redundant database showed that the taxa not represented in the current database belong to three different classes of Proteobacteria (alpha, beta and gamma).</s>
          <s>Hits to Bartonella, Commensalibacter and Snodgrassella were found in several samples, indicating that these bee gut microbiota phylotypes still lack some representation in the current database.</s>
          <s>In addition, hits to phylotypes not considered as part of the honey bee gut microbiota occurred sporadically (e.g.</s>

          <s>Core members are composed of sequence-discrete populations.</s>
          <s>To begin our characterization of the genomic diversity landscape of the honey bee gut microbiota, we first investigated whether phylotypes of this community harbor SDPs and hence are organized into genetically congruent units.</s>
          <s>To this end, candidate SDPs were identified in the reference database by clustering genomes based on phylogenetic relationships and pairwise average nucleotide identities (ANI) (see methods and <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>With this approach, we identified candidate SDPs for four of the five core phylotypes and for Bartonella apis, whereas no candidate SDPs were found for the core phylotype Snodgrassella alvi <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 4</ref> and 5, see methods).</s>
          <s>Since SDPs inferred from sequenced isolates could potentially result from biases in database representation, we validated the candidate SDPs using the metagenomic data (see methods and <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Briefly, orthologs of core gene families were extracted from the de novo assemblies of the metagenomic samples and aligned to the core sequences from the database.</s>
          <s>For true SDPs, the metagenomic core gene orthologs are expected to have a much higher similarity to one particular SDP relative to any other SDP (resulting in a 'gap-zone' as described in <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Indeed, we found a clear separation in the distribution of sequence similarity between the highest and second-highest scoring SDP for four of the five phylotypes with candidate SDPs <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Only for B. apis, the distributions overlapped <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2f)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this case, the wider curve for the highest-scoring SDP also shows that the current database does not fully grasp the diversity present in the metagenomic samples, as corroborated by the presence of B. apislike bacteria in the unmapped reads (Supplementary Data 2).</s>
          <s>Thus, it is possible that SDPs are present in B. apis, although with much less separation compared to the other phylotypes.</s>
          <s>A considerable fraction of the bifidobacteria in the metagenomic samples also lacked a close relative in the database <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the two SDPs (Bifido-1 and Bifido-2) were still discrete due to the large divergence between them.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since all samples in the current study were derived from the same geographic location, we additionally re-analyzed a previously published metagenomic dataset, which consisted of pooled honey bee guts sampled from a colony in the Unites States <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>Strikingly, as for the Swiss samples, most of the genomic diversity in this sample was represented by our reference database, with only 9% of the reads unmapped.</s>

          <s>a Three levels of diversity were explored in the current study: (i) phylotypes, i.e., bacteria with about 97% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene (as defined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies), (ii) SDPs (sequence-discrete populations), i.e. divergent sub-lineages contained within phylotypes, (iii) strains, i.e. any genomic diversity occurring within SDPs.</s>
          <s>A hypothetical example of possible distributions of strains across bees is shown with colored bars.</s>
          <s>b In total, 54 individual honey bees of different age and from two different colonies were sampled for shotgun metagenomics analysis.</s>
          <s>At each time point, six bees per colony were sampled.</s>
          <s>Colony 1 was sampled in two consecutive years.</s>
          <s>Bees sampled 10 days, 22/24 days, and 48/158 days after emergence are considered as 'young', 'middle-aged', and 'old', respectively.</s>
          <s>The 'old' bees correspond to winter bees as the sampling started in late September.</s>
          <s>c Guts of individual bees were dissected and subjected to a customized protocol enriching for bacterial DNA, which was then shotgun sequenced using Illumina.</s>
          <s>In parallel, a reference database of high-quality draft and complete genomes of bee gut bacterial isolates was established.</s>

          <s>In summary, a total of 11 SDPs were identified and validated within four of the five core phylotypes of the honey bee gut microbiota.</s>
          <s>This means that most core phylotypes of the bee gut microbiota have further diversified into genetically congruent units that can be detected with shotgun metagenomics.</s>
          <s>Compared to previously published species names, eight of the SDPs contain a single named species, two SDPs contain two species names, and one SDP has no associated species name yet <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>While additional SDPs may be present at low abundance, our analysis shows that we have identified the most dominant SDPs, and, that these are present in bees in both Europe and the United States.</s>

These plots were used to quantify the abundance of phylotypes/ SDPs in the metagenomic samples, but also to estimate the average population replication based on the ratio of the coverage at the origin and the terminus (peak-to-trough ratio, PTR). The red line corresponds to the segmented linear regression line that was fitted to the data to determine the mean coverage at origin and terminus. d Distribution of PTR values across the sampled bees for the five core phylotypes (based on samples with at least 10x terminus coverage). For each boxplot, the center line displays the median, the boxes correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers extend to the most extreme data points that are within the 1.5 interquartile range of the box.
