        <p>
          <s>Fathering behavior is largely shaped and influenced by social changes and cultural contexts.</s>
          <s>Social expectations of fathering behavior differed in different historical periods, also known as the 'epochs' of fathering <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the United States of America, fatherhood over the recent decades has evolved from being 'a moral teacher' to 'a providing father' and 'an involved father' <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Prior to industrial revolution, the responsibility of fathers was teaching moral values to their children and meeting the educational needs of their children.</s>
          <s>During the period of industrial revolution and the onset of the division of labor, fathers were accorded the role of being the breadwinner to provide for their families while mothers were the primary caregivers.</s>
          <s>In examining contemporary fatherhood, fathers are portrayed as 'involved fathers' or 'new men' who assume the breadwinning role and who are also involved in the family life <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>'Involved fathers' or 'new men' are defined as fathers who continue to assume the breadwinning role due to cultural expectations and, at the same time, play a more involved role in caring for their children <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The traditional gendered roles of men being the breadwinner and women being the caregiver were altered during the period of industrialization.</s>
          <s>More women were engaged in paid work outside their families, which gave rise to rising dual-income households and a change in the cultural image of fatherhood in developed countries.</s>
          <s>LaRossa highlighted that there exists a mismatch between the culture and conduct of fatherhood in the United States of America <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The conduct of contemporary fathers does not match the cultural expectation of an involved father.</s>
          <s>Fathers were aware of the ideal types of fatherhood they were expected to play; such as being involved fathers or new men.</s>
          <s>However, they did not behave according to those ideal types, resulting in the mismatch.</s>
          <s>Guided by the concept of reflexivity (whereby individuals shape their own choices, norms, and behaviors), theorists such as Giddens <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> and Beck <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> noted that as family life is influenced by social change, globalization, work changes, and political changes, fathers are free to decide on the fathering roles they wish to take on.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, Williams <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> took on a different stance in arguing that men are compelled to make decisions on their fathering roles based on a variety of factors rather than choosing the roles they wish to take on.</s>
          <s>In summary, fathers were aware of what they should do, but what they actually do is a result of a combination of various circumstances that they have no control of.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Culture has an influence on fathering behavior.</s>
          <s>Despite the shift towards a more egalitarian ideology due to the increasing number of women entering the labor market, Yeung <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> found that Asian fathers were less involved in providing physical and emotional care to their children compared to mothers as the breadwinning role remained to be fathers' dominant identity in the family context.</s>
          <s>Family ideology in Asia is heavily guided by patriarchy due to Asian ideological and religious influences from Confucianism, Hinduism, and Islamism.</s>
          <s>Patriarchy is more dominant among Shanghai fathers in China and Vietnamese fathers in whom Confucian ideology is heavily ingrained.</s>
          <s>Also, among Muslim Malay fathers in Malaysia, Malay families have always been found to be patriarchal <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Singapore, mothers were the primary caregivers their children along with extended families and domestic helpers, fathers' central role in the family remains as a provider and were therefore not socially expected to participate in the physical or emotional care of their young children <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In India, mothers were found to be responsible for the early childcare of children while fathers were out at work earning money <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Influenced by Confucian teachings, mothers were expected to be responsible for childrearing and domestic work while fathers played less of a direct role during infancy and young childhood in Vietnamese families <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In China and Hong Kong, there exists a worrying phenomenon related to fathering, as Hong Kong fathers were found to spent an average of six minutes a day with their children and Chinese fathers spent a maximum of 54 minutes a day with their children <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although men are seen to desire to be more involved in the family life, there exists many challenges and difficulties in fulfilling the ideal type of fathering role.</s>
          <s>Men in the United Kingdom are becoming more involved in family life and taking more responsibility in child care duties.</s>
          <s>However, they remarked that they were being 'squeezed' between playing the role of an involved father and the breadwinner's role due to work commitments <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Work commitment was one of the highest reported hindrance by fathers to be more involved in family life and in child care in other sociocultural contexts <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other factors that simultaneously influenced fathering behavior include fathers' relationship with their own father <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> , fathers' attitudes on the parenting role <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> , infant temperament <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , marital relationship, <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> and partner's employment status <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Maternal-infant bonding and synchrony (dyadic interaction) are beneficial for cognitive and social development, physical health, infant attachment, and trust <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Early paternal involvement during infancy was also found to benefit infants' neurodevelopment <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> and yield positive behavioral outcomes for children aged nine and eleven years old <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, fathers were encouraged to be involved as early as during the perinatal period by healthcare professionals.</s>
          <s>However, the postpartum period is widely known to be stressful and challenging.</s>
          <s>During this period of time, feelings of joy at the birth of the child can turn into feelings of frustration as the demands of parenthood kick in <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is crucial to understand fathers' experiences and needs during this period, when paternal involvement is shaped.</s>
          <s>To the best of our knowledge, one meta-synthesis was conducted by Goodman <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> on the fathering experiences of infants, which included peer-reviewed studies from 1990 to 2001.</s>
          <s>The meta-synthesis included studies that examined fathers' experiences and perceptions across the perinatal period, and it revealed the process of becoming an involved father through four stages.</s>
          <s>However, the broad focus of the perinatal period limits the challenges that were pertinent during the postpartum period.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the participants of the synthesis included both fathers and mothers, which may have hindered the experiences and needs of fathers being fully accounted for.</s>
          <s>Lastly, the meta-synthesis included studies from 1990 to 2001, which is backdated and changes to fatherhood may have been omitted.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This meta-synthesis aims to examine qualitative studies on fathers' experiences, needs, and perceptions of their involvement with their infants during the first 12 months of birth.</s>
          <s>Metasynthesis is valuable and beneficial in providing a novel perspective and fuller interpretation of a phenomenon through the compilation of several qualitative studies <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Multiple determinants, including sociocultural context, shape fathering behaviors.</s>
          <s>It is important to understand fathers' experiences, perceptions, and needs from their perspectives during early infancy so that necessary interventions may be given to fathers during the first 12 months of birth as it is known to be a stressful and challenging period of time.</s>

Fathers placed the infant in the center of their lives without giving up one's own person. The addition of the infant brought about happiness and warmth in the family, and fathers experienced a deeper relationship with their spouses. The contact between father and infant was facilitated by engagement and time spent alone with the child. To master fatherhood, the maintenance of integrity and possibility to develop an independent relationship with the infant is important. Healthcare professionals must be aware of fathers' needs.(Continued )</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Fathers' commitment to the relationship with their infant took hold at different times. Perceived rewards influenced fathers' feelings of connectedness towards their infants. The father-infant relationship continues to develop when infants could smile and vocalize. Some fathers experienced 'hesitant connection' whereby feelings of love for their infants did not appear at first. Nurses need to reassure fathers that fatherinfant relationships may evolve more slowly than mother-infant relationships.</figDesc>

John et al. 
(2005) 
Australia 

To explore new/subsequent 
Australian fathers' 
perspectives on the 
experiences, processes, and 
life changes in the early 
weeks of fatherhood. 

Grounded theory; 
in-depth interviews; 
constant comparative 
analysis 

6 to 12 weeks after the 
birth of each infant. 

18 fathers (first time and 
subsequent). 

Fathers found new or 
expanding fatherhood to be 
both rewarding and 
challenging. Work 
commitments limited fathers' 
abilities to participate with 
their families and newborns. 
Fathers had to balance the 
demands of work and 
demands at home. They have 
to deal with varied stressors, 
manage their time, develop 
routines and reprioritize their 
tasks at hand. Fathers 
developed a sense of self as 
fathers over time, building 
their confidence and 
satisfaction in the fathering 
role.

Shorey et al. 
(2018) 
Singapore 

To understand fathers' 
expectations, needs and 
experiences in infant care 
during the early 
postpartum period. 

Qualitative study 
(descriptive); 
semi-structured individual 
interviews; 
thematic analysis 

One week after the birth of 
the focal infant. 

50 fathers (34 first-time 
fathers and 16 experienced 
fathers), 22-50 years old, 
multi-ethnicity. 

The postpartum period was 
found to be stressful for both 
first-time and experienced 
fathers. Fathers desired to be 
involved but were hindered by 
their spouses who had little 
confidence in their infant care 
skills, work commitments, and 
lack of infant care skills. 
Experienced fathers faced the 
challenge of assimilating older 
children with newborn 
infants.
