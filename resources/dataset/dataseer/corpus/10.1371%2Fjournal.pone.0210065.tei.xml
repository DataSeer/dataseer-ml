            <s>A central experimental task in executive control research is the Stop-signal task, which allows measuring the ability to inhibit dominant responses.</s>
            <s>A crucial aspect of this task consists of varying the delay between the Go-and Stop-signal.</s>
            <s>Since the time necessary to administer the task can be long, a method of optimal delay choice was recently proposed: the PSI method.</s>
            <s>In a behavioral experiment, we show a variant of this method, the PSI marginal method, to be unable to deal with the Go-response slowing often observed in the Stopsignal task.</s>
            <s>We propose the PSI adjusted method, which is able to deal with this response slowing by correcting the estimation process for the current reaction time.</s>
            <s>In several sets of behavioral simulations, as well as another behavioral experiment, we document and compare the statistical properties of the PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method, and the traditional staircase method, both when reaction times are constant and when they are linearly increasing.</s>
            <s>The results show the PSI adjusted method's performance to be comparable to the PSI marginal method in the case of constant Go-response times, and to outperform the PSI marginal method as well as the staircase methods when there is response slowing.</s>
            <s>The PSI adjusted method thus offers the possibility of efficient estimation of Stop-signal reaction times in the face of response slowing.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Among executive functions, the ability to inhibit and change actions in order to regulate impulses and attain long-term goals has a central place.</s>
          <s>A core experimental method used to measure the concept of response inhibition is the Stop-signal task, originally developed by Logan and Cowan <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this task, on a majority of trials (Go-trials) a Go-signal is presented, to which participants have to respond as quickly as possible, producing the Go-reaction time (Go-RT).</s>
          <s>On a minority of trials (Stop-trials), the Go-signal is followed at some delay (the Stop-signal delay, SSD) by a Stop-signal, which instructs the participant to withhold the Go- did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s>

          <s>the function, and the ErrorRate determines the minimum and maximum the function can take on.</s>
          <s>A participant's performance in the task is described by a vector λ participant = (Threshold participant , Slope participant , ErrorRate participant ) in this three-dimensional parameter space.</s>
          <s>Our knowledge of a participant's performance λ participant at the start of the task is formalized as a probability distribution p 0 (λ) over the parameter space, which assigns each possible performance vector λ a probability p 0 of matching the participant's performance λ participant .</s>
          <s>When having no prior knowledge, at the outset of the task we can set p 0 (λ) as the uniform distribution.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 1: At the outset of Stop-trial 1, p 0 represents our prior knowledge of the participant's performance.</s>
          <s>For each SSD and response that is possible in trial 1, we can compute the posterior probability of each parameter vector λ, according to Bayes' theorem:</s>
        </p>
        <formula xml:id="formula_0">p</formula>
        <p>
          <s>where p(response|λ,SSD) is the psychometric function in Eqs 1 and 2. Thus, for each SSD we might present in the upcoming trial 1, and for each response the participant might give in return, we compute the posterior distribution over the parameter space.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 2: For each of these possible SSD-response combinations we compute the entropy H 0 of the resulting posterior distribution p 0 (λ|SSD,response) as:</s>
        </p>
        <formula xml:id="formula_2">H</formula>
        <p>
          <s>The entropy function stems from information theory and quantifies the amount of information necessary to fully specify the state of a system <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the current context, the entropy of each posterior distribution quantifies how much information is still needed to completely specify which vector λ in parameter space corresponds to our participant's performance vector λ participant .</s>
          <s>When deciding which SSD to offer on Stop-trial 1, we choose that SSD which yields the lowest entropy, and thus the most information about the participant's performance.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 3: Since the entropy function in Eq 4 is also dependent on the participant's response, we compute the current likelihood of the two possible responses (success, error) for each SSD, using the prior probability distribution p 0 (λ) and the psychometric functions in Eqs 1 and 2: Step 6: At the end of the task, after n Stop-trials have been concluded, we derive the parameter vector most likely to match our participant's parameter vector λ participant by computing the expected value of λ:</s>

        <p>
          <s>In a number of Stop-signal task simulations and behavioral experiments, Livesey and Livesey <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> showed that the PSI method can quickly and accurately estimate the SSRT.</s>
          <s>In terms of correlation with the actually simulated SSRT, as well as mean absolute deviation, the PSI method was comparable to the traditional staircase.</s>
          <s>However, the staircase was shown to provide a systematically biased estimate of the SSRT, overestimating short SSRTs and underestimating long SSRTs, even at more than 30 Stop-trials, while the PSI method arrived at a relatively unbiased estimate already after 10 Stop-trials.</s>
          <s>The PSI method thus promises as a viable alternative to the staircase method when quick and unbiased estimation of the SSRT is required.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of Go-response slowing on the PSI method.</s>
          <s>In Livesey and Livesey <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , the Go-RTs in both the simulations and the behavioral tasks are constant over the course of the experiment.</s>
          <s>However, it is known that the Stop-signal task can invite a gradual slowing of the Go-RTs over the course of the experiment <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is a strategic element to this slowing, since participants will sometimes try to slow their Goresponses in order to still catch the Stop-signal.</s>
          <s>Since this increases the participant's chance of correctly responding, the staircase algorithm will respond to this by further increasing the SSD, motivating the participant to further slow the Go-response.</s>
          <s>In this way, the staircase even promotes this strategic slowing.</s>
          <s>It is an open question how the PSI method can deal with this slowing effect in the Stop-signal task.</s>
          <s>In order to test this, we employ a version of the so-called Stop-change task, a variant of the Stop-signal task we have previously found to elicit strong Go-response slowing.</s>
          <s>Previous research has shown the processes involved in stopping and changing to be partly overlapping <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the following behavioral study we implement a slightly modified version of the PSI method, the so-called PSI marginal method <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the original PSI method, as used by Livesey and Livesey <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , the error rate determining the minimum and maximum p(error) the psychometric function can take on is usually fixed.</s>
          <s>Prins <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> showed that this can lead to a biased estimation of the threshold parameter, which is central to estimating the SSRT in the Stop-signal task.</s>
          <s>As a remedy, Prins proposed also adding the error rate-parameter to the parameter space, thus estimating three free parameters instead of two.</s>
          <s>As a further refinement, he proposed minimizing the entropy of a posterior distribution that is marginalized over irrelevant parameters (e.g. in the Stop-signal task, minimizing entropy of a posterior that includes the threshold parameter but is marginalized over slope and error rate, since these are not relevant to SSRT estimation).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In terms of the formulation above, this means changing Eq 4 so as not to compute the entropy H 0 (SSD,response) of the full posteriors, but instead to compute:</s>
        </p>
        <formula xml:id="formula_5">H 0À marginal ðSSD; responseÞ ¼ À X l p 0 ðThresholdjSSD; responseÞ � logðp 0 ðThresholdjSSD; responseÞÞ<label>ð9Þ</label>

        <p>

          <s>The Go-stimuli were two filled green squares, one on the left and one on the right side of the screen, to which participants responded by pressing the 'f'-and 'j'-keys on the keyboard with left and right index fingers simultaneously and as quickly as possible.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Before each Go-signal, a cue appeared that could give different degrees of information about the upcoming trial.</s>
          <s>The cue consisted of two hollow squares.</s>
          <s>In the foreknowledge condition, the cue would indicate on which side the Change-signal could appear (i.e. a green hollow square left and a red hollow square right, indicating a Change-signal might appear on the right).</s>
          <s>The cue was not completely informative, since the upcoming trial might still be a Gotrial, but if a Change-signal appeared, it was always on the cued side.</s>
          <s>In the no-foreknowledge condition, both hollow squares were red, such that on both sides a Change-signal might appear.</s>
          <s>The factor foreknowledge [yes, no] was crossed with the factor side [left, right], which corresponds to the side on which the Change-signal appeared.</s>
          <s>Consequently, there were four experimental conditions: foreknowledge-left; foreknowledge-right; no-foreknowledge-left; noforeknowledge-right.</s>
          <s>In addition to these Change-related conditions, another condition was included ("certain Go"), which did not include Change-trials.</s>
          <s>In this condition, the foreknowledge cue consisted of two hollow green squares, indicating that no Change-signal was going to appear.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While these different conditions are usually used to gauge the influence of foreknowledge and certainty of the stopping process, they are not relevant to our further discussion of the task, which we mainly used because it evokes substantial response slowing.</s>
          <s>However, a summary table of behavioral performance of the different conditions can be found in the supplementary materials (S1 and S2 Tables).</s>
          <s>The foreknowledge cue remained on the screen for 1500 ms, followed by a 500 ms fixation cross, followed by the Go-stimulus.</s>
          <s>The Go-stimulus ended with the response or after 2500 ms, followed by an 850 ms inter trial interval.</s>

          <s>The experiment started with a training run, introducing participants to the different conditions of the Stop-change task.</s>
          <s>Subsequently, participants completed two runs of the full task, one with the SSD controlled by the traditional staircase tracking procedure, the other controlled by the PSI marginal algorithm.</s>
          <s>The staircase tracking procedure used a stepsize of 50 ms, starting at 250 ms and being limited to 50 ms to the low end, and 1200 ms at the high end.</s>
          <s>The PSI marginal method employed a Weibull function as a model for the psychometric function.</s>
          <s>It considered SSDs ranging from 50 to 1200 ms in steps of 50 ms, and considered those same values as possible threshold parameters.</s>
          <s>The slope parameters considered were ranged from 1 to 13 in steps of 1. Error rates considered ranged from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The order of the two blocks was counterbalanced, each run took approximately 30 minutes, containing in total 300 trials: for each of the four foreknowledge-side conditions, there were 17 Change-trials and 51 Go-trials (25% Change-trials per condition), making 272 trials.</s>
          <s>Additionally, there were 28 certain-Go trials.</s>
          <s>In both runs, after approximately 75 trials, participants could take a break.</s>
          <s>The order of trials was quasi-randomized, with the restrictions that no more than 3 Change-trials followed each other, that the first 6 trials of a run were Go-trials, and that the first trial after a break was a Go-trial.</s>

          <s>In effect, the PSI marginal method is not able to keep up with the slowed Go-RTs.</s>
          <s>Notice that the SSRT is ultimately computed with the expected parameter combination, not the maximum probability parameters, but nevertheless reaching the boundary of the parameter space invalidates the method's SSRT estimates.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, when the mean Go-RT has slowed down considerably, the critical SSD estimated by the method is, after a sufficient number of trials, based on this slowed Go-RT.</s>
          <s>However, when computing the SSRT, the mean Go-RT of the entire block is usually used.</s>
          <s>Thus, the critical SSD subtracted from the mean Go-RT might only be based on a slowed subset of Go-RTs toward the end of the experimental block.</s>

          <s>A further consequence arising from response slowing in the Stop-signal task is the overall accuracy of the participants.</s>
          <s>Although the staircase method is designed to converge on an accuracy of around 0.5 and can to some degree "follow" the participant's slowed Go-responses, if responses are being slowed down too quickly, they can escape the staircase and allow the participant to attain an accuracy substantially higher than 0.5.</s>
          <s>This is especially true if the experiment contains multiple conditions and thus, the amount of response slowing between the different conditions' interleaved trials is larger.</s>
          <s>However, an accuracy of around 0.5 is necessary for an accurate computation of the SSRT.</s>
          <s>Although the PSI marginal method is not explicitly designed to converge at 0.5, it also usually settles around this value.</s>

          <s>A participant's performance is now characterized by a three-dimensional vector ω = (SSRT participant ,Slope participant ,ErrorRate participant ).</s>
          <s>Thus, we estimate SSRT directly, instead of the threshold parameter.</s>

        <formula xml:id="formula_7">Threshold ¼ meanGoRT À SSRT<label>ð11Þ</label>
        </formula>
        <p>
          <s>Since the psychometric function is defined in terms of the threshold parameter, we use Eq 11 to convert a given SSRT value to its corresponding threshold value.</s>
          <s>In order to do that, we need an estimate of the participant's mean Go-RT.</s>
          <s>Since during response slowing, the Go-RT changes throughout the task, the first step in each Stop-trial is to estimate the current mean Go-RT.</s>
          <s>This is done via linear regression: over a sliding window including the last several Gotrials, the Go-RTs are regressed on their respective trial numbers.</s>
          <s>The resulting linear regression equation is used to predict the Go-RT of the current trial, which serves as an estimate of meanGo-RT in Eq 11.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The logic behind this is that a participant's SSRT is a characteristic not changing with response slowing.</s>
          <s>The slowing only affects the threshold parameter, which indicates the SSD at which p(error) = 0.5.</s>
          <s>This threshold trails behind the continuously slowing Go-RT, while the distance between the Go-RT and the threshold (the SSRT) remains constant.</s>
          <s>By estimating the changing Go-RT and adjusting the threshold parameter for it, we can estimate the unchanging SSRT.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>After having estimated the current Go-RT at the outset of the Stop-trial, we also need to adjust our SSD range.</s>
          <s>Until now we have not touched upon the range of SSDs to choose from, but since we now adjust for slowing Go-RTs, we have to ensure that the SSDs that can be offered in our Stop-trial match the range of threshold values that are possible under our current estimate of the Go-RT and the range of SSRT parameters in our parameter space.</s>
          <s>On each Stop-trial, we let SSDs range from meanGoRT À maxðSSRTÞ to meanGoRT À minðSSRTÞ where min(SSRT) and max(SSRT) are the minimum and maximum SSRTs of our parameter space.</s>
          <s>In practice, we also truncate negative SSDs to 0. After these adjustments at the start of a Stop-trial, the method follows the PSI marginal method outlined earlier, except that all distributions are now defined over ω parameter space.</s>

          <s>The error rate varied across experiments but was the same for all participants.</s>
          <s>Each experiment contained 100 Stop-trials and 200 Go-trials.</s>
          <s>In each experiment, 41 participants were simulated, each with a different SSRT ranging from 50 to 250 in steps of 5 ms.</s>
          <s>In each experiment, three different methods ran in parallel (classic staircase method, the PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method), each determining on its own which SSD should be presented next, and each receiving responses based on separately drawn Go-RTs.</s>

          <s>The running estimate of the Go-RT was computed by linearly regressing the Go-RTs of the last several Go-trials (at least 15, at most 40; covering the last 7-20 Stop-trials) on their trial's number, and then predicting the upcoming Go-RT from the linear regression equation.</s>

          <s>However, this leaves open the question of whether this decrement in performance results simply from the RTs increasing ("pure" slowing), or whether the cause of the problem is the behavior of the participant reaching and crossing the boundaries of the method's parameter space, specifically the threshold parameter's boundaries.</s>
          <s>These two issues are separable, since pure slowing can occur while the participant's behavior is still well within the parameter space, and since a certain degree of pure slowing can be accommodated by simply increasing the range of threshold parameters available to the PSI marginal method.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To investigate the effect of pure slowing on the PSI marginal and PSI adjusted methods in the absence of reaching the parameter space's boundaries, we performed an additional set of simulations building on simulations 2.</s>

          <s>The simulations were generally identical to simulations 2, again with 3 different degrees of response slowing being simulated (5, 10 and 15 ms per Stop-trial), but now for each participant only the PSI marginal method and PSI adjusted method ran in parallel.</s>
          <s>Both methods worked as described in simulation 2, except that now, the parameter space of the PSI marginal method was changed in a way that until Stop-trial 100, all participants' behavior stayed within the parameter space despite the Go-RTs increasing.</s>
          <s>For example, with a Go-response slowing of 5 ms per Stop-trial, after 100 Stop-trials, the mean Go-RT lies at the initial 400 ms + 500 ms = 900 ms.</s>
          <s>Since the critical SSD = Go-RT-SSRT, and since the fastest SSRT simulated was 50 ms, at the end of the 100 trials the largest critical SSD of the simulated participants lies at 850 ms.</s>
          <s>To accommodate for this increase of the critical SSD (and thus, the increasing threshold parameter of the PSI marginal method), we set the threshold parameter space of the PSI The PSI adjusted method marginal method to range from 0 to 1000 ms (in steps of 5 ms).</s>
          <s>Since the smallest critical SSD at the start of the task lies at 400 ms-250 ms = 150 ms, the 0 ms lower end of the parameter space leaves a buffer of 150 ms.</s>
          <s>Similarly, the 1000 ms upper end exceeds the largest critical SSD at the end of the experiment by 150 ms.</s>
          <s>This principle was adhered to by all three simulated degrees of response slowing.</s>
          <s>Thus, for a slowing of 10 ms per Stop-trial, the threshold parameter space for the PSI marginal method ranged from 0 to 1500 ms in steps of 5 ms, while for a slowing of 15 ms per Stop-trial, the PSI marginal method's parameter space ranged from 0 to 2000 ms in steps of 5 ms.</s>

            <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig 11 compares</ref> the PSI marginal and PSI adjusted method with respect to their parameter estimates over the course of the experiment.</s>
          <s>For the PSI marginal method (Experiment 1), there is a considerable number of participants, specifically those slowing their Go-responses, for which the threshold parameter receiving the highest probability in the posterior distribution reaches the method's upper boundary, thus limiting the method's ability to estimate the true SSRT.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, a smaller number of participants reach the lower boundary of the PSI marginal method's parameter space.</s>
          <s>These are participants showing particularly fast Goresponses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While for the PSI marginal method strong response slowing causes a parameter drift toward the upper boundary, in the PSI adjusted method the maximum probability parameters are visibly more stable over time, both for slowing and non-slowing participants.</s>
          <s>There is, however, a small number of participants in the slowing group whose parameter estimates in the PSI adjusted method drift toward the lower end of the parameter space.</s>
          <s>There thus appears to be some residual influence of response slowing on parameter estimation.</s>
          <s>Importantly, this problem is far less pronounced than in the PSI marginal method used in Experiment 1.</s>
          <s>We come back to the reasons behind this effect in the discussion.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another problem we noted for the PSI marginal method and staircase in Experiment 1 was that for slowing participants, accuracy levels substantially deviated from 0.5.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">As Fig 12 shows</ref> , the PSI adjusted method is successful at maintaining accuracy at roughly 0.5 throughout the experiment, for both slowing and non-slowing participants.</s>
          <s>As in Experiment 1, the staircase method is only able to maintain this intended accuracy level for non-slowing participants.</s>

          </s>
          <s>A further question relevant to the PSI adjusted method is how many trials are optimal when estimating Go-RTs through linear regression.</s>
          <s>While the up-to 40 trial long window used by us to predict current mean Go-RT appears to have worked fine, we present additional analysis of Go-RTs in supplementary S6 <ref type="figure">Fig, in which mean</ref> and standard deviation of the residuals of the RT prediction are shown, as a function of different window sizes.</s>
          <s>While the variability The PSI adjusted method of residuals reaches a stable minimum with window sizes larger than 10 to 15 trials for both slowing and non-slowing subjects, the mean residual stays between -1 and 1 ms roughly between window sizes of 1 and 30 trials.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The original PSI method for the Stop-signal task <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> was proposed to allow optimal sampling of SSDs in Stop-trials, thus allowing shorter experimental lengths.</s>
          <s>In this article, we showed that the PSI marginal method, and by implication the original PSI method, cannot adequately deal with the kind of response slowing often found in Stop-signal tasks.</s>
          <s>We proposed a PSI adjusted method that continuously estimates Go-RTs and adjusts for possible slowing, thereby allowing optimal sampling of SSDs despite slowing.</s>
          <s>In three sets of Stop-signal task simulations, we compared the performance of this adjusted method to the PSI marginal method as well as the classic staircase method.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we tested how the PSI adjusted method fares when employed with human participants showing strong Go-response slowing.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>From the simulation results, it is clear that when there is no response slowing, the PSI methods offer improved performance in estimating SSRTs, especially for small trial numbers and when unbiased estimation of the spectrum of SSRTs is important.</s>
          <s>In the face of response slowing, as is common in Stop-signal tasks, it is crucial to correct the PSI method for the changing response speed.</s>
          <s>When this is achieved, as in our proposed PSI adjusted method, this method can offer improved performance over the staircase method even under considerable response slowing.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another interesting result most clearly visible in <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">Fig 4</ref> is that the traditional staircase combined with the mean method is considerably worse for estimating SSRTs at low trial numbers than when combined with the integration method.</s>
          <s>This performance decrement is visible when inspecting the slope between simulated and estimated SSRTs, showing that either smaller SSRTs are overestimated or larger SSRTs are underestimated.</s>
          <s>The cause of this behavior is that when using the mean method, it is assumed that the SSDs offered up to this point correspond to a performance of 0.5.</s>
          <s>However, since the staircase takes a certain time to reach that performance level, the SSDs subtracted from the mean Go-RT will introduce a certain bias, which varies depending on the true SSRT of the participant.</s>
          <s>With the integration method, on the other hand, this bias is corrected for by using not the mean Go-RT, but a percentile of the RT distribution that corresponds to the participant's behavior.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A further benefit of the PSI methods not discussed so far is that for every point during the experiment, they provide a likelihood distribution over the parameters underlying the participant's performance, and thus a likelihood distribution over the SSRT estimate at that point.</s>
          <s>This allows computing a confidence interval of sorts around the updated SSRT estimate after every Stop-trial (similar to the illustration of SSRT estimation in <ref target="#fig_9" type="figure">Fig 7)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This opens up interesting new experimental opportunities, such as only running a Stop-signal task until a certain level of confidence in SSRT has been reached, or dynamically controlling stimulus presentation based on the SSRTs that are likely or unlikely for a participant.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As shown in the results section of Experiment 2, there appears to be a residual effect of Goresponse slowing on SSRT estimation even for the PSI adjusted method.</s>
          <s>This is likely the result of less than optimal estimation of Go-RTs for this method, particularly an underestimation of Go-RTs.</s>
          <s>The mechanism behind this is the following: when participants have longer Go-RTs than estimated by the method, they are capable of still stopping for SSDs that would be too long under their actual SSRT, thus leading to a reduced estimated SSRT.</s>
          <s>Since the PSI adjusted method presented here predicts Go-RTs by linearly regressing previous RTs on trial number, <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">As Fig 2,</ref> the PSI adjusted method's posterior distribution for the example participant.</s>

          <s>Furthermore, the PSI adjusted method only predicts mean Go-RTs, thereby ignoring other properties of the Go-RT distribution, such as variance and skewness, which would be taken into account under the ex-Gaussian parameterization of the RT distribution.</s>

          <s>S3 and S5 Figs show the relationship between the SSRT estimates of the staircase blocks and the PSI method's blocks, separately for Experiment 1 and 2. While the number of data points is not very large, it is clear that the correlations between estimates from the staircase method and the PSI methods are far from perfect.</s>
          <s>This is likely caused by response slowing, since the correlation coefficients are larger in the non-slowing groups, both for Experiment 1 and 2. In these groups, the adjusted PSI method produces SSRT estimates more in line with the staircase method than the PSI marginal method does.</s>
          <s>It is an open question to which degree the correlation-diminishing effects of response slowing are stemming from the PSI methods' SSRT estimates or the staircase method's estimates.</s>
          <s>Both the PSI methods and the staircase method might contribute to this deviation of estimates: the PSI marginal method does not take into account response slowing, and the adjusted PSI method's estimate of Go-RTs might be suboptimal, while the staircase method might just as well not be able to deal effectively with Go-RT slowing.</s>
          <s>Future research might elucidate the source of these incongruencies in SSRT estimates.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While the method of optimal RT estimation is of technical relevance, there is also the more theoretical question of whether Go-response slowing invalidates the Stop-signal and related tasks.</s>
          <s>Indeed, it has often been pointed out that the independent horse race model underlying the analysis of behavior in this task assumes independence between the Go-process driving the Go-response and the Stop-process responsible for inhibiting this response.</s>
          <s>Since Go-response slowing in this task is generally related to the presence and prevalence of Stop-trials <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> , this might call into question the validity of Stop-signal tasks that provoke considerable response slowing.</s>
          <s>We think these tasks are nevertheless important precisely because of this slowing.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While the mathematical independent horse race model understands the Go-and Stop-process as independent, it has been noted that pure independence can be paradoxical when addressing the instantiation of response stopping in the brain <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>After all, the Stop-process must exert some form of influence over the Go-process in order to prevent its execution.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, Boucher et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> showed that effects explained by the independent horse race model can be captured in an interactive horse race model where Go-and Stop-process do interact in a delayed and pronounced manner.</s>
          <s>We think that when discarding Go-response slowing simply as a nuisance when estimating SSRT, one is discarding a property inherent in the very neural inhibition system that is being studied.</s>
          <s>In this point we agree with other authors who have made Go-response slowing in Stop-signal tasks an explicit subject of experimental investigation <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>

          <s>In this area of research, response slowing in the context of Stop-signals has often been taken as an indicator of proactive inhibition, and some results suggest that the The PSI adjusted method neural processes involved in reactive response inhibition are also partly involved in proactive inhibition and can be indexed by response slowing <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Indeed, quantifying not just reactive but also proactive inhibition in the same task has been useful in analyzing neural data and providing a more complete picture of the inhibition system <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is not to say, of course, that response slowing cannot be an obstacle to correct estimation of SSRT, as has been shown previously <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>If precise estimation of only SSRT is paramount, experimental methods of preventing slowing can be crucial, such as giving participants feedback on their RTs.</s>
          <s>However, we think that in order to investigate the entire response inhibition system, Go-RT slowing must also be accounted for, which necessitates methods of SSRT estimation in the presence of slowed Go-responses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A criticism that could be levelled against our behavioral experiments is that we used a nontraditional Stop-task, namely the Stop-change task, and included different conditions, which simulation studies usually do not.</s>

Highest probability parameters for the PSI marginal method (Experiment 1) and PSI adjusted method (Experiment 2) over the course of the experiment. The participants were split intro groups depending on whether the showed go-response slowing. Every line represents one of the stop-change task's conditions of one participant; thus, there are four lines per participant. Black lines indicate a parameter reaching the upper end of the parameter space, red lines indicate parameters reaching the lower end. Parameter estimates were slightly smoothed using a cubic spline to facilitate visual inspection. Note that while maximum probability parameters are shown, SSRTs are eventually computed based on the expected parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210065.g011</figDesc>
