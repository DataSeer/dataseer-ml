        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by the damage of neurons of basal ganglia and four cardinal motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability.</s>
          <s>These pathological features are induced by the slow and progressive death of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> .</s>
          <s>The histopathology of PD is also characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, which are mainly composed of aggregates of the α-synuclein (α-syn) protein 2 .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, many studies showed that in PD patients the presence of α-syn is increased in the brain <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> .</s>
          <s>Mutations and multiplication of the α-syn gene (SNCA) are associated with familial PD <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several studies have tried to understand the role of fibrillary and oligomeric forms of α-syn on neuronal damage <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>Conversely, only a few studies are available on the mechanisms underlying α-syn-induced synaptic dysfunction.</s>
          <s>The striatum, a subcortical nucleus receiving major excitatory inputs from the cortex and the thalamus, is a brain region particularly involved in PD.</s>
          <s>We previously demonstrated that exogenous α-syn application, applied at nanomolar concentrations, directly affects striatal neurotransmission by targeting N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors and reducing synaptic currents <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
          <s>This α-syn-triggered NMDA receptor-dependent alteration might in turn participate in intracellular spreading of α-syn, also affecting NCX1 function expressed in the striatum at the mitochondrial level.</s>
          <s>It has also been reported that α-syn alters the hippocampal synaptic transmission in normal rodents <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Accumulation of α-syn in human dopaminergic neurons leads to different neurotoxic mechanisms such as the reduction of mitochondrial complex I activity, the increase of production of reactive oxygen species, and the deregulation of mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>Emerging findings suggest that exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides, can increase the levels of α-syn <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among these drugs, rotenone (Rot), an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, induces a parkinsonian-like phenotype in rats through α-syn accumulation, caspase activation, dose-dependent ATP depletion, and oxidative damage <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In vitro studies have shown that acute application of Rot on rat striatal slices induces a widespread degeneration of striatal neurons <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, experiments on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells reported that combined exposition to α-syn and Rot deregulates Ca 2+ homeostasis by opening voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Indeed, the deregulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis, both at cytosolic and mitochondrial levels, might contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including PD <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Both in in vitro and in vivo models of PD, it has been demonstrated that NCLX is an essential regulator of mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, several studies seem to indicate that other transporters may also play a role <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among them, Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) has recently gained much attention.</s>
          <s>NCX is a key regulator of ionic homeostasis at both the plasma membrane and mitochondrial levels, as it can facilitate Na + and Ca 2+ flow in bidirectional way <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>NCX family encompasses three members NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 differently expressed in the brain <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>NCX1 is particularly expressed in the basal ganglia where it represents a key player in controlling ionic homeostasis at both plasma membrane and mitochondrial levels in the striatum <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>A role of plasma membrane NCX in the pathogenesis of PD has also been suggested <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, the administration of an inhibitor of plasma membrane NCX attenuated the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a PD model <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The aim of the present study was to analyze the involvement of both plasma membrane and mitochondrial NCX1 in the toxicity induced by combined application of α-syn and Rot in different neuronal models.</s>
          <s>Specifically, as in vitro model we used SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells differentiated with retinoic acid to a neuron-like state; as ex vivo model we used striatal slices from adult rats.</s>

          <s>It has been previously shown that α-syn and Rot impact neuronal cell viability, in particular they reduce mitochondrial complex I activity causing changes of Ca 2+ levels <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>In order to test whether α-syn affected per se the basal synaptic transmission, we recorded the fEPSP for 40 min in the presence of 3 nM α-syn in control striatal slices.</s>
          <s>In this condition we found no effect of α-syn on the fEPSP <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Afterwards, we studied the effect of α-syn plus Rot.</s>
          <s>We recorded striatal fEPSPs in control slices and then in slices exposed for 1 h to α-syn.</s>
          <s>After acquiring a stable baseline for 10 min, 0.3 µM Rot was applied for further 40 min.</s>
          <s>We found that the fEPSP amplitude, in slices maintained in control medium (aCSF), was reduced by 30% with respect to baseline values (before Rot exposure), while the fEPSP amplitude of slices pretreated with 3 nM α-syn was reduced by 60% compared to baseline.</s>
          <s>Thus, the incubation of the slices with α-syn for 1 h significantly increased the detrimental effect of Rot on the fEPSP amplitude with respect to the effect of Rot in control slices <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref> (P &lt; 0.0001).</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The regulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis is an important process for neuronal survival, and its dysregulation has long been recognized to play a major role in neurodegenerative diseases <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the present study, using different neuronal models (namely striatal slices and RAdifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells), we showed that mitochondrial NCX1 is involved in the cell toxicity induced by the concomitant exposure to α-syn and Rot.</s>
          <s>In particular, this finding is supported by three main results.</s>
          <s>Firstly, the alteration of striatal electrical activity induced by α-syn and Rot is prevented by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial NCX with CGP-37157, but not by using the plasma membrane NCX inhibitor SN-6.</s>
          <s>Secondly, α-syn and Rot increased mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels in striatal slices through a mechanism that involved NCX m , While several studies have investigated the toxic effects induced by α-syn and Rot on neurons, including synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial complex I deficiency <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44]</ref> , little is known on the mechanisms underlying the convergent detrimental effects induced by the concomitant application of α-syn and Rot.</s>
          <s>Previous reports have demonstrated that in PC12 cells and in neurons of the substantia nigra, Rot raised intracellular Ca 2+ , leading to increased α-syn aggregation <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Here, we presented electrophysiological evidence that in striatal rat slices, α-syn plus Rot led to enhanced neurotoxic effects causing progressive irreversible loss of excitatory striatal transmission and electrical signals.</s>
          <s>This detrimental effect could be prevented by blocking mitochondrial NCX1, suggesting that NCX m could represent an important target for the control of acute synaptic dysfunction induced by the concomitant action of α-syn and Rot.</s>
          <s>Growing evidence suggest that, in the presence of toxic stimulus, the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake may induce apoptosis in a variety of pathological conditions <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, Ca 2+ dysregulation has been previously reported in α-synopathy models of PD.</s>
          <s>Accordingly, evidence from many studies suggest that α-syn and Ca 2+ may be related in several ways.</s>
          <s>For instance, it has been reported that α-syn induces a reduction of ΔΨ m and a disruption of electronic transport complex (ETC), thus accelerating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, an increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ levels may also occur since α-syn may form plasma membrane pores, allowing extracellular Ca 2+ to pass into the cytosol <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>This in turn may worsen mitochondrial function through the increased Ca 2+ uptake <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, Angelova et al. <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> showed that the overexpression of intracellular α-syn in neuroblastoma cells altered basal and depolarizing-stimulus-evoked Ca 2+ signals and confirmed that α-syn per se can induce a Ca 2+ flux across neuronal membranes through pore formation <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several Ca 2+ transporters are implicated in the ionic regulation, and between them NCXs (namely NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> ) represent critical proteins contributing to Ca 2+ homeostasis in the brain <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, the expression of all three NCX isoforms has been already reported in isolated mitochondria <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recently, the main role of plasma membrane and mitochondrial NCX1 in controlling energy metabolism in several cell types, including neurons and astrocytes, has been demonstrated <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31,</ref>
            <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">48</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, a metabolic stimulus, such as glutamate, could induce the reverse mode of NCXm, as a consequence of glutamate-induced Na + influx through excitatory amino acid transporters 31 .</s>
          <s>α-Syn and Rot interact with Na + /K + -ATPase with a reduction of its ability to pump out Na + , thus leading to Na + accumulation.</s>
          <s>Consequently, Ca 2+ overload may occur <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49,</ref>
            <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">50</ref> .</s>
          <s>In line with these observations, it is possible to speculate that under our conditions, the Na + influx and the disruption of ETC may contribute to ΔΨ m perturbation, ultimately forcing the mitochondrial NCX1 to work on the reverse <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> Effect of SN-6 on mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels in SH-SY5Y differentiated cells exposed to α-synuclein (α-syn) and rotenone (Rot).</s>

          <s>For each experimental group, Δ% values used for the statistical analysis derived from 4 independent experiments and 50-100 cells were recorded in each different session (*P &lt; 0.0001 α-syn+Rot vs control and control+SN-6; the α-syn+Rot group was not significantly different from α-syn+Rot+SN-6 group).</s>

          <s>Our data showed that in SH-SY5Y cells, Ca 2+ increase can be prevented by silencing of NCX1, mimicking the effect of CGP-37157 in striatal slices.</s>
          <s>An interesting study has already proposed that plasmalemmal NCX isoforms, in particular NCX2 and NCX3, contribute to mitochondrial Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger in human DAergic neurons acting downstream PINK1, a pathway implicated in a recessive form of PD, preventing neuronal death induced by mitochondrial Ca 2+ accumulation <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>Notably, the role of another mitochondrial Ca 2+ antiporter, NCLX, has been reported 51 .</s>
          <s>Palty et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> and Luongo et al. <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> demonstrated that in SH-SY5Y undifferentiated cells and transgenic mice, NCLX is an essential regulator for mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the same authors showed that the pharmacological modulation of NCLX (using CGP-37157) did not fully inhibit mitochondrial Ca 2+ efflux.</s>
          <s>Thus, NCLX may play an important role but its contribution is not sufficient to regulate mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels.</s>
          <s>Therefore, as suggested by several evidences, it is reasonable to hypothesize that other transporters, including NCX1, play a critical role in controlling mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In line with our findings and existing literature, we can assert the relevance of mitochondria in the pathology of PD.</s>
          <s>The involvement of mitochondrial defects in PD pathology is also supported by pharmacological evidence showing deleterious effects of inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as Rot, mPTP, or paraquat 52 .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, our data confirmed that α-syn has an important role in controlling neuronal mitochondrial dynamics, and in particular in regulating Ca 2+ signals in animal models of PD as well as in PD patients <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">52</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, our study shows for the first time a critical interaction among α-syn Rot-induced toxicity and mitochondrial NCX1, suggesting that NCX1 might represent a possible target for disease modifying therapy in PD.</s>
