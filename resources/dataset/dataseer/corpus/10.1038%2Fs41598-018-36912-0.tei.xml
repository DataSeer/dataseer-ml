          <s>Currently, it is uncertain what renders neurons hypersensitive to ATM deficiency.</s>
          <s>In line with the canonical function of ATM in DDR, brain degeneration in A-T has been ascribed to the inappropriate DNA repair in preand post-mitotic neurons, boosting the rate of genotoxic lesions.</s>
          <s>However, increased oxidative stress and reduced anti-oxidant defense, themselves reflecting a non-canonical cytoplasmic activity of ATM, may equally play a role in A-T, considering that high oxygen consumption and metabolic activity expose brain neurons to elevated ROS levels that can induce abundant SSBs <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>Neurodegeneration has also been ascribed to transcriptional decline of genes implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking and release <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>

          <s>The proteolytic removal of Top1-ccs, an essential step to avoid collision with the replication or transcriptional machinery and conversion of SSBs into lethal DSBs <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> , is ATM-dependent <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> , and the accumulation in ATM deficient cells of Top1-ccs <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>

          <s>A recent hypothesis suggests that A-T brain degeneration might arise from dysfunctional glial cells, in turn impairing the functionality and viability of neural cells <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>

Western blots were performed on DIV30 neurons treated for 1 hr with CPT and collected immediately and 3hrs (a) or at later time (b) after drug washout. The ATM inhibitor was added 1hr prior CPT and left throughout the experiment. Vinculin and Î²-Actin are loading controls for proteins. Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:651 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36912-0 induction might be explained by the activation of the DDR elicited by the accumulation of activity-dependent DSBs, which is known to be defective in A-T cells. A-T and ATM-KO neurons share significant differences in the basal transcriptomic profile compared to WT neurons. To find out if ATM deficiency affects the basal transcriptional signature, we compared the RNA-Seq profiles of the unperturbed WT1, A-T1 and ATM-KO1 neurons. Genes found differentially expressed in A-T1 and ATM-KO1 relative to WT1 are listed in Suppl.</figDesc>
