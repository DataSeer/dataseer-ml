            <s>As an informative proxy measure for a range of urbanisation and socioeconomic variables, satellite-derived night-time light data have been widely used to investigate the diverse anthropogenic activities and reveal social economy development disparities from the regional to the national scale.</s>
            <s>The new-generation night-time light data have been proven to potentially improve our understanding in the development and inequality of urban social economy due to its high spatial resolution, strong timeliness and minimal background noise.</s>
            <s>These night-time light data are derived from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) instrument with day/night band located on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite.</s>
            <s>This study proposed a hybrid model to estimate urban consumption potentiality based on the comprehensive information of human activities obtained from the VIIRS night-time light data.</s>
            <s>Our method established a flexible geographically weighted regression-based estimation model based on the residential consumption data and DN values of the VIIRS data to predict the possible consumption potentiality of other urban areas in dynamic time.</s>
            <s>The experiment conducted in Guiyang, a provincial capital in China, affirms that our model is proven to have higher accuracy compared with traditional regression models and can potentially provide guidance for improved business management and increased profit.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Deeply involving the world development wave, the Chinese economy has experienced remarkable growth in the past 30 years, resulting in the rapid increase of their purchasing ability.</s>
          <s>The gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) improved from 241 dollars in 1978 to 8592 dollars in 2016, with the total consumption amount reaching 5.2 trillion dollars in 2016 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although online shopping has provided an extent impact for entity retail sales, its market shares are still small compared with offline shopping.</s>
          <s>According to the National Statistics Bureau of China, the scale of online shopping was only 15% of the total Chinese retail industry in 2017.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the increasing rate of online shopping has shown a continuously decreasing trend with DN values in the DMSP/OLS data is small (0-63), thereby resulting in the over-saturation in city centres.</s>
          <s>Only the DMSP/OLS data from 1992-2003 are available.</s>
          <s>Thus, many studies that use the DMSP/OLS data cannot focus on social economy problems after 2013 <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The DMSP/OLS data are obtained by different satellites, thereby making the equality of data different even between contiguous years.</s>
          <s>In October 2011, the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite with the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) was launched by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC).</s>
          <s>As the new generation of night-time light data, the VIIRS night-time light data are superior than the DMSP/OLS data in spatial and radiometric resolution (15 arc seconds, 0.5 km × 0.5 km), radiometric detection range and on-board calibration <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Two types of products were available in the NPP-VIIRS website (https://ngdc.noaa.gov/</s>
          <s>eog/viirs/index.html),</s>
          <s>namely, 'vcm' and 'vcmsl'.</s>
          <s>'vcm' and 'vcmsl' are monthly averaging datasets that exclude and include the impact caused by stray light, respectively.</s>
          <s>The timeliness of the NPP-VIIRS data is better than that of the DMSP/OLS data.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the former is still updated each month, making it superior than the DMSP/OLS data in studying issues after 2013 <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The VIIRS data have been adopted to be a remarkable indicator of spatio-temporal human activities <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> and economics <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> owing to the aforementioned superiorities.</s>
          <s>Thus, the capability of the VIIRS data makes its use in the estimation of consumption potentiality in business management possible.</s>
          <s>Unlike other data sources, the VIIRS night-time light data have several obvious advantages for business managers.</s>
          <s>Firstly, the artificial night-time light of VIIRS can reflect the use of public and commercial lighting, which are strongly associated with the commercial activities and the state of the economy.</s>
          <s>Consequently, modelling the relationship between the VIIRS data and commercial potential for the retail industry through simple models is easy.</s>
          <s>Secondly, night-time light data are timely with low cost and flexible spatial scale.</s>
          <s>These characteristics help business managers distinguish the spatio-temporal patterns of consumers and update their business strategies, such as product distribution and advertisement strategy, each quarter or each month, in accordance to the update frequency of the VIIRS data.</s>
          <s>The VIIRS data will potentially be a new data source with great conveniences and high accuracy for retail business management.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In previous studies, a simple linear regression model was widely adopted to reveal the relationship between the VIIRS and economy data, including the estimation of the total GDP <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results only affirm a simple redistribution of the total GDP according to the DN values of each grid.</s>
          <s>To optimise the method, Wang <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> adopted the Huff Model in the estimation of consumption potential and site selection of new business facilities.</s>
          <s>In his study, the spatial distance between target grids and city centres was considered such that the consumption potential of a grid was not just determined by its input, but also its locations in space, which was closer to reality.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study primarily aims to prove the potentiality of new data sources with high convenience and low cost in the estimation of consumption potential and provide other practical models for retail business management.</s>
          <s>In this study, the commercial consumption data (historical fast-moving consumer good sales data of retail shops in Guiyang, China) were combined with the VIIRS night-time light data and fed into a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to reveal the correlational relationship between the VIIRS night-time light data and consumption potentiality.</s>
          <s>Through spatial division, our study areas were divided into thousands of small grids that contain different DN values and historical consumption amounts in 2014.</s>
          <s>These grids were used to train the GWR model, which was proven to have high accuracy in reflecting the correlation between DN values and consumption amount.</s>
          <s>After precision validation, the model was subsequently used to estimate the consumption potential from 2015 to 2017.</s>
          <s>We also compared our model with other models.</s>
          <s>The results corroborate that our model has higher accuracy than traditional regression models and is then used to estimate the consumption potential from 2015 to 2017.</s>
          <s>The research can potentially provide guidance for business managers to formulate improved retail business strategies.</s>

          <s>The remaining contexts are organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the study area and data source used in the research.</s>
          <s>Section 3 introduces the methods, including the establishment of the GWR-based regression model, the spatial inequality index and the potential estimation process.</s>
          <s>Section 4 conducts the experiments in Guiyang, China, and regions in Guiyang were distinguished according to their market values.</s>

          <s>The natural scenery in Guiyang is unique due to its moist climate because of high average elevation (more than 1100 metres.</s>
          <s>Known as the "Forest City', the natural scenery in Guiyang, such as the famous Huangguoshu Mountains and Waterfalls, attracts tourists from all over the world.</s>
          <s>The overall territory area of Guiyang is 8034 square kilometres, which includes six regions and three county-level cities.</s>
          <s>The permanent resident population in Guiyang is over 4.5 million in 2016.</s>

          <s>The 'One Belt, One Road' programme, which is an initiative proposed by China in 2013, aims to establish a huge economic cooperation platform with distinction from China to Europe <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The social economy has experienced prominent development, with the total GDP reaching 56.35 billion dollars and GDPPC reaching 10.79 thousand dollars, which is more than the average level of China.</s>
          <s>The big data industry in Guiyang has been developing rapidly, and the national big data-centre has been set in Guiyang, making it become the gathering place for the information industry and data trading businesses.</s>
          <s>Guiyang is also a pilot city of the circular economy in China.</s>
          <s>Thus, many new economy patterns have been developed in Guiyang.</s>
          <s>The rapid economic development has attracted many foreign investments to establish their business chains in Guiyang, thereby making the estimation of consumption potentiality in different areas and the distribution of the commercial resource in reasonable ways challenging for business managers.</s>

          <s id="dataset-1" type="Dataset:Existing dataset">The data were obtained from the official website of NOAA's National Centres for Environmental Information (https:// ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/index.html).</s>
          <s>Three types of dataset were provided in the website: Raw (RDR), sensor (SDR) and environment data records (EDR) <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>SDR is the production that contains radiance.</s>
          <s>Thus, SDR is used in this study.</s>
          <s>The SDR data are open access for the public and updated each month from May, 2011 to April, 2018.</s>
          <s>In the original dataset obtained from the website, the effects of aurora, fires, boats and other ephemeral lights have not been removed.</s>
          <s>Generally, the first step is to remove the effects of these background noises.</s>
          <s>In this study, the following preparations were taken before the analysis of VIIRS.</s>
          <s>(1) For the reduction of the influence of background noise and abnormal lights, the maximum radiance value derived from the city centre was set as the upper threshold.</s>
          <s>We distinguished two city centres that aggregated many pixels with high DN values.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the maximum DN value in the two centres was 125.8.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the DN value of −125.8 was set as the upper threshold.</s>
          <s>Pixels with large DN values were considered the outliers and should be set as 0. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The low threshold was obtained from the non-residential areas.</s>
          <s>The process was realised through the overlay of the night-time light image with land use data extracted from the Landsat8 dataset.</s>
          <s>An average DN value of −4.7 of pixels, containing lakes and rivers, was set as the lower threshold.</s>
          <s>In this way, the light values that were smaller than the lower threshold or larger than the upper threshold were treated as noises, and their values were set as 0.</s>

          <s>The maximum digital number (DN) value in the original image was 351.29, which was far more than the regular DN values of residential areas, because the monthly night-time light data contain unstable or instantaneous light information.</s>
          <s>We found that the maximum DN value was 125.8 and that 248 pixels with larger DN values were mainly distributed far away from the city centres through the sampling of the pixels in the city centre.</s>
          <s>The DN values of these regions, which were far away from the city centres, were distinguished as abnormal values and adjusted to the background values of 0, such as region a <ref type="figure">(Fig 2 (B)</ref> and 2(C)).</s>
          <s>For regions with large DN values but located in the urban areas, the DN values were adjusted to 125.8.</s>
          <s>Another influence factor was the background noises that exist in the original image, which could result in negative values or missing data in some pixels, such as region b <ref type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The DN values of these regions were also set as 0 to eliminate the errors.</s>
        </p>

        <head>GWR model</head>
        <p>
          <s>In previous studies about night-time light data, the ordinary least square models (OLS) were often adopted to model the relationship between independent and dependent variables, such as the study of CO 2 diffusion <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> and GDP spatialization <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, the OLS models were only the simplified description of these relationships, which impertinently suppose the spatial equality of social economy factors.</s>
          <s>However, the correlation between the DN values and the consumption potential cannot be modelled only through a set of constant parameters.</s>
          <s>However, according to the 'second law of geography', spatial heterogeneity widely existed even in any social contexts <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> , indicating that the pixel locations also affect their prediction values.</s>
          <s>This basic rule is ignored, and mistakes due to low accuracy often occurred in the results of OLS when adopted in the city space.</s>
          <s>In this study, the geographical weighted regression (GWR) model was introduced to model the relationship between DN values and market sales performance.</s>
          <s>The GWR model is an improvement of traditional OLS models, in which spatial locations are considered in the model <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The GWR model is better in describing DN values and consumption potential than OLS models.</s>

        <figDesc>19 billion dollars in 2014 to 1.57 billion dollars in 2017. Moreover, the increasing rate was stable at 8.4% and 8.5% from 2014 to 2016. The consumption potentiality increased remarkably in 2017, with the promotion over 0.17 billion dollars and increasing rate reaching 12.1%. For the determination of the growth in space, the consumption potentiality in micro-scale was estimated. Fig 4 shows the increase of consumption potentiality in different areas. Fig 4 shows the development of sales performance in Guiyang City from 2014 to 2017. The sales performance in 2014 was set as the reference, and the degree of red colour shows the increasing ratio compared with that of last year. The results in Fig 4 affirm that the total increase of consumption potentiality was relatively stable between 2014 and 2016 and that great differences existed in each distinct. Guiyang experienced a relatively high increase in the east part of the distinct during 2016 and 2017. The most evident increase of consumption potentiality was in the south regions, including Guanshanhu, Huaxi and Nanming, which were the core areas of Guiyang. In nearby counties, Xiuwen, Wudang and Qingzhen have obtained a great potential increase from 2015 to 2017.</figDesc>
