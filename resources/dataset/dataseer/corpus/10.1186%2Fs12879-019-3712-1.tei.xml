            <s>Background: Previous studies demonstrated that the diversity and composition of respiratory microbiota in TB patients were different from healthy individuals.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the aim of the present analysis was to estimate the relative proportion of respiratory microbiota at phylum and genus levels among TB cases and healthy controls.</s>
            <s>Methods: The PubMed and Google Scholar online databases were searched to retrieve relevant studies for the analysis.</s>
            <s>The statistical analysis was done using STATA version 11, pooled estimates are presented using graphs.</s>
            <s>The summary of findings in included studies is also presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> .</s>
            <s>Results: The phylum level analysis shows that the pooled proportions of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Crenarchaeota were determined among tuberculosis patients and healthy controls.</s>
            <s>In brief, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla in both TB cases and healthy controls, composing 39.9 and 22.7% in TB cases and 39.4 and 19.5% in healthy controls, respectively.</s>

            <s>Neisseria (27.1%),</s>
            <s>Prevotella (9.02%) and Veillonella (7.8%) were abundant in TB patients.</s>
            <s>The Prevotella (36.9%),</s>
            <s>Gammaproteobacteria (22%), Streptococcus (19.2%) and Haemophilus (15.4%) were largely seen in healthy controls.</s>
            <s>Interestingly, Veillonella, Rothia, Leuconostoc were unique to TB cases, whereas Lactobacillus, and Gammaproteobacteria, Haemophilus, and Actinobacillus were identified only in healthy controls.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The composition of the respiratory microbiota in TB patients and healthy controls were quite different.</s>

          <s>A microbiota is a group of microbial communities, namely bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi, and viruses, which have been described in various parts of human body.</s>
          <s>Commonly, the term microbiome is used to describe bacteria only, whereas the term mycobiome and virome are mostly used to describe fungal and viral populations, respectively.</s>
          <s>Understandably, the skin, gut, urogenital tract, upper respiratory tract and oral cavity are the common habitat of complex microbiomes <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was generally assumed that the lower respiratory system was free of microbial agents, but recent advancement demonstrated that these airways contain a complex variety of microbes, particularly abundant on the mucus layer and epithelial surfaces of the lower respiratory system.</s>
          <s>It is stated that the microbial diversity of the lung is determined by the immunity of the host, virulence of the microbes and the microbial content of the inhaling air <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>To date, studies revealed several microbial agents in the lung of diseased and healthy controls.</s>
          <s>Notably, the most prominent bacterial phyla are Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and the Prevotella, Veillonella, but Streptococcus and Pseudomonas were also commonly isolated bacterial genera in the respiratory samples of TB patients and controls.</s>
          <s>The pulmonary microbiota studies in human beings showed that type and diversity of microbes are affected by disease conditions, antibiotic therapy, environmental factors, and socio-demographic factors.</s>
          <s>Recent evidence showed that the composition of respiratory microbiomes in tuberculosis (TB) patients and healthy controls were different <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>

          <s>Hence, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla in both TB cases and healthy controls, composing 39.9 and 22.7% in TB cases and 39.4 and 19.5% in healthy controls, respectively.</s>

          <s>The conventional culture technique remains the gold standard to investigate microbial infection, although the added value of molecular techniques in the diagnosis of infectious diseases is increasingly recognized.</s>
          <s>Considering the fact however that more than 90% microbial agents cannot be cultured with the current methods <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">12]</ref> , there it is obviously a reason to invest in molecular approaches.</s>
          <s>Recently, high throughput molecular techniques are becoming popular to investigate the composition and diversity of microbial flora.</s>
          <s>Notably, the 16 s rRNA sequencing platform is largely used for accurate identification of the microbiota of the human body.</s>
          <s>The whole genome and shotgun metagenomic sequencing have also been applied for comprehensive analysis of microorganisms <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>

          <s>The diversity and composition of the respiratory microbiota have been investigated in both normal, healthy individuals and diseased persons.</s>
          <s>It has been noted that the respiratory microbiota changes after infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13,</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The main interest of characterizing microbial community is to determine whether a disease-specific condition is associated with a particular human microbiota <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To the best of our knowledge, the role of the respiratory microbiota for the occurrence of latent or active TB remains unclear.</s>
          <s>Moreover, evidence showed that there is a unique microbial diversity among TB patients versus healthy controls, but the findings are so far controversial.</s>
          <s>For instance, according to Cheung et al Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were significantly observed in TB cases and healthy controls, respectively <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, Wu et al reported that Firmicutes was more presented in TB cases, whereas Bacteriodetes was largely seen in the samples from healthy controls <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence, the purpose of this study was to compile discoveries in the relation between the diversity of respiratory microbiota and TB.</s>
          <s>Besides, it was also meant to estimate the overall proportions of the predominant respiratory microbes among TB patients and healthy individuals.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The present study revealed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Crenarchaeota were the major bacterial phyla demonstrated among TB cases and healthy controls.</s>
          <s>The Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla in both TB cases and healthy controls.</s>
          <s>However, statistically, significant differences were observed in the proportion of Actinobacteria and Crenarchaeota being more present in TB than healthy controls.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the Bacteroidetes was more common in healthy controls than in TB cases.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the genus level analysis indicates that unique bacterial genera have been identified among TB cases and healthy controls.</s>
          <s>In brief; the pooled proportions of 10 bacterial genera have been estimated, hence Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Prevotella were commonly observed in both TB and healthy controls.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, Veillonella, Rothia, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus were found to be unique to TB patients.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the Gammaproteobacteria, Haemophilus, and Actinobacillus were observed only in healthy controls.</s>
          <s>As mentioned before, few studies have been conducted to explore the microbial diversity in TB patients compared healthy individuals.</s>
          <s>Even more, the type and composition of respiratory microbiota were contrasting each other from one study to the other.</s>
          <s>Besides, the associations of viral and fungal microbes with tuberculosis were not sufficiently evaluated, since the fact that the previous studies have been carried out using 16S rRNA sequencing platform, which is not used to identify microbes other than bacteria.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is suggested that more comprehensive analysis is needed, and detail investigation with the whole genome and shotgun sequencing should be considered to elucidate the microbial profile of the respiratory system accurately.</s>
          <s>Aside from the above, future research needs to be directed to pinpoint the role or impact of respiratory microbiota in TB occurrence and maturation of the local immunological aspects.</s>
