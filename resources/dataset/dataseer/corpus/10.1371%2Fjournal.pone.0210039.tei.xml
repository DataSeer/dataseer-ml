          <s>Cancer is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Effective physical activity (PA) interventions to curb the growth in inactivity and prevent chronic illness in cancer survivors are essential <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PA prevents cardiovascular disease (CVD) <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> and can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> and improve overall survival, yet few survivors meet current PA guidelines of at least 150-minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, there are significant geographic inequalities in cancer survival, which need to be addressed <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Effective, distance-based PA interventions are essential in order to reduce such geographic inequalities in survival.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Evidence from trials support the efficacy of PA interventions in producing short-term, but not long-term change in cancer survivors <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Most interventions tend be supervised and/ or facility-based, and subsequently resource-intensive.</s>
          <s>Home-based and distance-based interventions (such as those using wearable activity technology) may mitigate access and transport issues, and are less expensive than supervised, facility-based programs requiring participants to attend classes or maintain a health club membership <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is a current gap in the literature on less intensive home-based interventions that could be cost-effective, and more scalable.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Interventions that offer opportunities for self-monitoring have successfully increased PA in cancer survivors <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , and survivors report that self-monitoring is a helpful tool for improving PA <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Wearable activity trackers (WATs) hold great potential as a low-cost self-monitoring tool to increase PA.</s>
          <s>Lyons et al <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> reviewed 13 different WATs and their associated apps, and concluded that they use many behavior change techniques employed in typical PA interventions (i.e.</s>
          <s>self-monitoring, feedback, goal-setting).</s>
          <s>WATs are perceived as useful and acceptable to individuals with chronic conditions <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, WATs may represent a relatively low-cost, feasible and scalable approach for widespread PA promotion in cancer survivors.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To date, only a few studies have examined the acceptability and usefulness of WATs to promote physical activity amongst older adults or those with chronic diseases, <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> and only one study has explored acceptability in breast cancer survivors <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This found participants mostly increased their awareness of the amount of time spent active or number of steps achieved.</s>
          <s>However, the study recruited only metropolitan breast cancer survivors, and half were already active.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Little is known about the feasibility of using WATs in interventions with survivors, and in particular, to promote PA to regional and remote survivors.</s>
          <s>In order to design and develop effective interventions, it is essential to first understand the utility of, and preference for WATs, and WAT features amongst such survivors.</s>
          <s>The aim of this study is to explore the acceptability and utility of, and preference for WATs in cancer survivors living in regional and remote areas of Western Australia, in order to develop more effective interventions.</s>

          <s>The Garmin models were also favourable due to their slim in appearance and because the screen was bigger and the display stayed on.</s>
          <s>The most common complaint regarding useability concerned the Fitbit Alta and difficulties tapping to view the statistics.</s>

        <head>Strengths and limitations</head>
        <p>
          <s>Our study has certain limitations including a low response rate, which may have introduced response bias.</s>
          <s>Additionally, our sample is predominantly female (87.5%) (since patient enrolment was limited to databases with a heavy preponderance of female malignancies including breast and gynecologic).</s>
          <s>Therefore we cannot assume that our findings are transferable to male cancer survivors, particularly the findings in relation to aesthetic preferences.</s>
          <s>Further, extended-term acceptance could not be explored.</s>
          <s>A study strength is the recruitment of underserved survivors living in rural areas, and the first feasibility testing of providing WATs with written instructions and/or telephone technical support.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>WATs appear to be acceptable to cancer survivors living in rural locations and may represent a low-cost, feasible and scalable approach for PA promotion.</s>
          <s>WATs increased self-awareness of physical activity, provided real time feedback in relation to goals, and reinforced progress and efforts toward goals.</s>
          <s>The aesthetics of the WATs were deemed crucial in determining likelihood of use.</s>
          <s>Future interventions may do well to have two different WATs available for participants to select from, according to activity preferences, aesthetic preferences and display size.</s>
          <s>Future research should explore whether WAT use and increased PA is sustained over time.</s>
