            <s>Studies of the B cell repertoire suggest that early childhood influenza infections profoundly shape later reactivity by creating an "imprint" that impacts subsequent vaccine responses and may provide lasting protection against influenza strains within the same viral group.</s>
            <s>However, there is little known about how these early childhood influenza exposures shape CD4 T cell reactivity later in life.</s>
            <s>To investigate the effect of age on influenza-specific CD4 T cell specificity and functionality, reactivity in cohorts of 2 year old children and young adult subjects was compared.</s>
            <s>Intracellular cytokine staining was used to determine the viral antigen specificity and expression levels of various cytokines following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with complete peptide pools representing the entire translated sequences of the pH1, H3, HA-B, NP, and M1 proteins.</s>
            <s>We found that the influenza protein-specific immunodominance pattern in children differs from that in young adults, with much lower reactivity to the NP internal virion protein in young children.</s>
            <s>Alterations in CD4 T cell functionality were also noted, as responding CD4 T cells from children produced less IFNÎ³ and were less likely to express multiple cytokines.</s>
            <s>These differences in the repertoire of influenza-specific CD4 T cells available for recall on influenza challenge in early childhood could possibly contribute to early imprinting of influenza-specific immunity as well as the increased susceptibility of children to this viral infection.</s>

          <s>All children had received prior influenza vaccinations with IIV but none had a documented history of acute influenza infection or had ever been vaccinated with a live attenuated influenza vaccine.</s>
          <s>This subject cohort was compared to a group of 20 young adult students between the ages of 20 and 28 enrolled under the University of Rochester Campus Influenza Study who had blood drawn per study protocol in late spring/summer of either 2011 or 2012.</s>
          <s>The majority of subjects in both cohorts had documented immunization with the seasonal influenza vaccine in the past (100% of pediatric, 90% of adult subjects), with most of the pediatric subjects and 50% of the adult subjects having documented influenza vaccine administration in the previous year ( <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>None of the subjects had been diagnosed with a recent acute influenza infection.</s>

          <s>Multiparameter flow cytometry was then performed to quantify CD4 T cell surface marker expression and cytokine production simultaneously on the small sample sizes available from young children.</s>
          <s>Following exclusion of debris and doublets, cells were gated on live, CD3+, CD4+ cells to evaluate CD4 T cell specificity and function, with cytokine expression measured by gating on activated (CD69+) cytokine positive cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>As IFNÎ³ is considered a classical Th1 cytokine and influenza-specific CD4 T cell responses are typically Th1 biased, we initially evaluated the immunodominance hierarchy by quantifying IFNÎ³-producing CD4 T cells, with overall immunodominance by protein calculated as the frequency of IFNÎ³+ CD69+ cells per million CD4 T cells in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref> and as a fraction of the total response in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref> .</s>
          <s>Young adults had greater total influenza-specific CD4 T cell reactivity when quantified by IFNÎ³ production, with about 4.8-fold more total IFNÎ³+ CD69+ CD4 T cells when compared to children when all specificities were summed (total of 965 IFNÎ³+ CD69+ cells per million CD4 T cells in adults versus 201 in children).</s>

          <s>This contrasted with what was seen in the adult population, where the CD4 T cell response to NP was immunodominant.</s>
          <s>Unlike with NP, the HA-B-specific CD4 T cell response appeared to be established at a very early age, with greater than expected reactivity to HA-B even prior to children having a history of an influenza B infection.</s>
          <s>This implies that early IIV immunizations establish a high frequency of HA-B-specific CD4 T cells, with this pattern reinforced further upon subsequent influenza exposures throughout life.</s>
          <s>In contrast, reactivity to NP and M1 was quite low, suggesting that the quantity of internal virion proteins and/or the amount of inflammatory signaling within IIV does not appear to prime CD4 T cell reactivity to these proteins in previously uninfected children.</s>
          <s>Next, overall production of IFNÎ³, IL-2 and TNFÎ± in pediatric compared to young adult subjects was examined by summing the frequency of cells producing each cytokine across the stimulation conditions examined <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These data demonstrate that influenza-specific CD4 T cell responses are less Th1 biased in IIV vaccinated children compared to young adults, with higher frequencies of cells producing IL-2 or TNFÎ± compared to IFNÎ³.</s>
          <s>This difference was highlighted by calculating cytokine production in each of the populations as a ratio normalized to the frequency of IFNÎ³+ CD69+ cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>When calculated in this manner, the ratio of cells producing IL-2 or TNFÎ± compared to IFNÎ³ was higher in pediatric compared to young adult subjects (IL-2/ IFNÎ³ p = 0.001; TNFÎ±/IFNÎ³ p &lt; 0.0001).</s>
          <s>When the frequency of CD4 T cells producing IFNÎ³, IL-2, or TNFÎ± was individually quantified for each of the proteins <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> , the pediatric population had a higher frequency of influenza-specific CD4 T cells producing TNFÎ± compared to IFNÎ³ across all conditions examined.</s>
          <s>Consistent with our data examining cellular specificity using IFNÎ³ alone, the overall frequency of cells specific for the internal virion proteins (NP and M1) remained low for all cytokines quantified.</s>
          <s>Responses to the pH1, H3, and HA-B proteins, which are abundant in IIV, were more similar between the pediatric and young adult populations, especially when CD4 T cell frequency was quantified using IL-2 or TNFÎ± as opposed to IFNÎ³.</s>

          <s>In addition, to facilitate statistical comparison between the groups, influenza-specific CD4 T cells elaborating each cytokine combination were summed across stimulation conditions and presented as a ratio of cells producing each cytokine combination compared to the total CD4 T cell frequency.</s>
          <s>This ratio is then presented <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> .</s>

          <s>Cells were then stained as described in Materials and Methods and gated using the strategy outlined in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> as a box plot, with statistical testing performed between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with P-values adjusted for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini Hochberg correction <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref> .</s>

          <s>When examined in this manner, the relatively low frequency of CD4 T cells producing IFNÎ³ was again demonstrated, with a much smaller arc for IFNÎ³ (green) in the pediatric <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5A</ref> ) as compared to the adult <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5B</ref> ) population.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, there was a relative dearth of polyfunctional cells overall detectable in pediatric subjects, with a lower proportion of cells able to produce IFNÎ³/IL-2/TNFÎ± simultaneously (red pie; p &lt; 0.0001) as well as a decreased percentage of cells producing either IFNÎ³/IL-2 (orange pie; p &lt; 0.0001) or IFNÎ³/TNFÎ± (dark green pie; p &lt; 0.0001).</s>
          <s>However, this was likely the result of less CD4 T cell elaboration of IFNÎ³ rather than a global deficit in the ability of CD4 T cells to produce multiple cytokines, as there were a greater proportion of cells producing the combination of IL-2 and TNFÎ± in pediatric subjects (light blue pie; p = 0.0001).</s>
          <s>Pediatric subjects also had an increase in the percentage of cells producing TNFÎ± alone (purple pie; p &lt; 0.0001) and IL-2 alone (dark blue pie; p = 0.04), again reinforcing the presence of a less Th1-biased influenza-specific CD4 T cell response in children.</s>

          <s>In this manuscript we detailed differences in CD4 T cell specificity and function between a pediatric population with limited influenza exposures compared to young adults who likely have had multiple previous encounters with influenza virus.</s>
          <s>We found that children had an overall lower frequency of influenza-specific CD4 T cells, most markedly to the internal virion protein NP.</s>
          <s>In addition, younger children had a less Th1-biased CD4 T cell response in comparison to the young adult cohort, with fewer polyfunctional cells and a reduced ability to produce IFNÎ³.</s>
          <s>These findings provide important insight into the evolution of the influenza-specific CD4 T cell response from childhood into adulthood.</s>
          <s>All children in our study had previously been vaccinated with IIV but had no history of previous natural influenza infection or LAIV administration, suggesting that early childhood IIV immunization is able to prime CD4 T cell reactivity but that the memory established remains more undifferentiated and mainly directed against the HA proteins predominant within IIV <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">27,</ref>

          <s>He et al. demonstrated significant increases in IFNÎ³ producing influenza-specific CD4 T cells in young children between 6 months to 4 years of age following vaccination, with a positive correlation between increasing age and baseline influenza-specific CD4 T cell reactivity <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>Post-vaccination boosting of influenza-specific CD4 T cells was also reported by Reber et al. in a study of older children <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, other groups have reported little priming of CD4 T cells following prime-boost administration of IIV in childhood <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33,</ref>

          <s>The shift in CD4 T cell specificity and functionality between childhood and adulthood, marked by a gain in reactivity to internal virion proteins and a shift to greater production of IFNÎ³ by influenza-specific CD4 T cells, suggests evolution of anti-influenza reactivity over time through repeated antigenic exposure.</s>

          <s>That this immunodominance pattern is established very early in childhood could be in part due to growing use of quadrivalent vaccines that contain twice the amount of the influenza B HA protein.</s>
          <s>Additional studies to evaluate whether this immunodominance pattern is preserved in young children following administration of a trivalent versus a quadrivalent vaccine could help to clarify the importance of antigenic dose in the early immunodominance of the HA-B protein demonstrated here.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although we only quantified CD4 T cell elaboration of IFNÎ³, IL-2, and TNFÎ± in this study, the pattern of cytokine expression demonstrated here may indicate an overall less differentiated CD4 T cell response in children.</s>
          <s>This, together with the dearth of memory CD4 T cells specific for epitopes within the more conserved internal virion proteins, could contribute to the increased morbidity seen in young children upon infection with a seasonal influenza virus.</s>
          <s>While consideration could be given to the use of vaccine adjuvants in order to more robustly prime a Th1 biased anti-influenza CD4 T cell response of broad specificity in children, how to utilize such immune activators to establish lasting immunologic memory against multiple influenza strains upon vaccination remains uncertain.</s>
          <s>Further, it is possible that it is precisely the lack of preexisting cell-mediated immunity in children that allows for the establishment of long-lasting B cell mediated immunity upon early influenza infection, as the greater antigen abundance and inflammatory signaling could lead to a more robust germinal center reaction <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">42</ref> .</s>
          <s>The data presented here thus raise a multitude of questions regarding the mechanisms responsible for and consequences of changes in influenza-specific immunity between children and young adults.</s>
          <s>Studies to address these knowledge gaps are currently ongoing and will be critical to the development of next generation influenza vaccines able to provide durable protection against multiple influenza strains in populations of diverse age and exposure history.</s>
          <s>To better illustrate differences in cytokine production between the pediatric and young adult cohorts, subjectlevel data across each stimulation condition was summed for each cytokine combination and then was divided by the total number of cytokine-producing cells across all conditions.</s>
