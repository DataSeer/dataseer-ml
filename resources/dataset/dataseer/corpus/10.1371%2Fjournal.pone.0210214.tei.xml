            <s>People with serious mental illness die 10-25 years sooner than people without these conditions.</s>
            <s>Multiple challenges to accessing and benefitting from healthcare have been identified amongst this population, including a lack of coordination between mental health services and general health services.</s>
            <s>It has been identified in other conditions such as diabetes that accurate documentation of diagnosis in the primary care chart is associated with better quality of care.</s>
            <s>It is suspected that if a patient admitted to the hospital with serious mental illness is then discharged without adequate identification of their diagnosis in the primary care setting, follow up (such as medication management and care coordination) may be more difficult.</s>
            <s>We identified cohorts of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who accessed care through the North York Family Health Team (a group of 77 family physicians in Toronto, Canada) and North York General Hospital (a large community hospital) between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014.</s>
            <s>We identified whether labeling for these conditions was concordant between the two settings and explored predictors of concordant labeling.</s>
            <s>This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using de-identified data from the Health Databank Collaborative, a linked primary care-hospital database.</s>
            <s>We identified 168 patients with schizophrenia and 370 patients with bipolar disorder.</s>
            <s>Overall diagnostic concordance between primary care and hospital records was 23.2% for schizophrenia and 15.7% for bipolar disorder.</s>
            <s>Concordance was higher for those with multiple (2+) inpatient visits (for schizophrenia: OR 2.42; ).</s>
            <s>Capture-recapture modeling estimated that 37.4% of patients with schizophrenia (95% CI 20.7-54.1)</s>
            <s>and 39.6% with bipolar disorder (95% CI 25.7-53.6)</s>
            <s>had missing labels in both settings when adjusting for patients' age, sex, income quintiles and co-morbidities.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses (SMIs) affecting approximately 1% of the population <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These conditions are associated with a substantially increased risk of early death, primarily from cardiovascular disease and neoplasms <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>People with these conditions die 10-25 years sooner than those without with most of the early mortality related to cardiovascular morbidity rather than mental health issues <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>They frequently have high degrees of comorbidities and are cared for by different health care providers including family physicians and mental health professionals <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Those with SMI have more frequent hospital admissions, both for mental health and physical health related reasons <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Accurate and complete documentation of conditions is essential to allow health care providers to recognize whether any patient lives with a condition.</s>
          <s>Accurate documentation also allows generation of practice cohorts; this can lead to identification of risks relevant to all patients with a condition as well as planning interventions to address these <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In primary care, the 'cumulative patient profile' constitutes the definitive source of information regarding health conditions for patients.</s>
          <s>It is considered the "master list" for health information for patients by regulatory authorities <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>If a condition is not present in this list, specific risks associated with that condition may not be identified or acted upon.</s>
          <s>Patients with SMIs experience high mortality and substantial morbidity from conditions that are amenable to primary prevention in primary care, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.</s>
          <s>It is critical that SMIs be documented appropriately in the primary care record: this will allow identification of practice populations at elevated risk, planning of strategies to address risk and measurement and improvement of quality of care <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Patients with SMIs frequently access care in both hospitals and primary care.</s>
          <s>They are more likely to be hospitalized than those without SMIs <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Upon discharge from hospital, these patients may access follow up care with psychiatrists, other mental health professionals and family physicians <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Family physicians are most commonly tasked with helping patients with SMI manage their physical health; factors associated with cardiovascular health are the most substantial contributors to early mortality <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In Ontario, Canada's largest province, integrated care systems do not exist between primary care and hospital services.</s>
          <s>However, there are high degrees of loyalty in referral networks from local primary care providers to hospital services, as well as in patients who access care from local primary care providers attending the local hospital emergency department preferentially when necessary.</s>
          <s>This geographic loyalty is estimated at 70%, which means that most of the clinical data for patients are held between their primary care provider and their local hospital <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>

          <s>This study found substantial disagreement in diagnostic labeling of two SMIs-schizophrenia and bipolar disorder-between primary care and hospital records.</s>
          <s>Although there was higher agreement about diagnostic labeling among those with more frequent inpatient visits overall the study found overall poor concordance without any clear patterns to identify groups of patients that had good labeling agreement.</s>
          <s>Capture-recapture modeling suggested that between 35% to 37% of schizophrenic patients and 26% to 44% of bipolar patients may not have a label in either setting.</s>
          <s>Primary care and hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Previous work has identified low concordance for multiple conditions, including asthma and cardiovascular disease <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our group has previously reported poor concordance (in the 20-30% range) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) in the same database <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To our knowledge, there is no study exploring labeling concordance between primary care and hospital records for SMIs.</s>
          <s>This is surprising, given the essential role of primary care in preventing and managing physical illness among people with these conditions.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We were unable to conduct chart audits using established diagnostic criteria, such as OPCRIT for schizophrenia <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> in order to establish a 'gold standard' for determining diagnostic accuracy among study participants.</s>
          <s>It is likely there is some degree of over-and underdiagnosis in both settings, and that this may contribute to disagreement in diagnostic labeling.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The prevalence of schizophrenia in Canada is estimated to be between 0.2% -2%.</s>
          <s>An estimate of 1% is commonly used <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The estimated prevalence in our study was 0.3% for schizophrenic patients and 0.6% for bipolar patients which is somewhat lower than this estimate This may be due to under diagnosis in the study population.</s>
          <s>In order for these diagnoses to be recorded, a clinician needs to document the diagnosis.</s>
          <s>Another possibility is that patients with serious mental illnesses in this population disproportionately access secondary care in specialized mental health settings, which are available in other institutions in the Greater Toronto Area, and access primary care through services that are geographically proximate to these mental health services.</s>
          <s>We are unable to test this hypothesis with our data.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A reason for the lack of concordance could be that these conditions were not identified in Emergency Department records; patients may have visited for minor conditions, and the SMI was never recorded by clinicians as part of the medical history in that setting.</s>
          <s>However, a substantial proportion of patients also had an inpatient admission in the three years of interest: 54.6% of patients with schizophrenia and 47.6% of patients with bipolar illness had been hospitalized at least once.</s>
          <s>Most patients admitted to hospital for mental health reasons are first seen in the emergency department.</s>
          <s>Patients may have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder in the ED and then subsequently identified as having SMI afterwards, which may not be reflected in these data.</s>
          <s>(The converse may also be true, where patients were diagnosed with SMI and subsequently identified as being under the influence of substances).</s>
          <s>Some patients were labeled with a SMI in the hospital system, were then seen by their family physician and were not labeled; this points to opportunities for cohort generation for quality improvement purposes in primary care in order for clinicians to fully document patients' medical histories to ensure relevant conditions are identified and managed appropriately</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We found that there were more patients with SMI labeled with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder only in primary care records.</s>
          <s>Many patients with these conditions are fairly stable, and may receive both physical and mental health care mostly through primary care providers.</s>
          <s>A study examining where people with mental illness access care in Alberta, Canada (another Canadian jurisdiction with provincially-funded, free at the point of care medicare) found that the majority of patients with mental illnesses are cared for primarily by primary care physicians <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Ontario, there are incentives for physicians to identify patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in the form of a lump sum yearly payment, for those who have provided care to 5 or more patients with these conditions.</s>

        <head>Limitations</head>
        <p>
          <s>There are several strengths of this study, such as its use of a novel linked primary-secondary care database, the exploration of health service access across the primary care-specialist care divide, and the extraction of fine granularity data from primary care EMRs.</s>
          <s>However, there are key limitations.</s>
          <s>As described above, we did not have access to the primary source of administrative data for inpatient mental health visits, the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS).</s>
          <s>Some patients may have been diagnosed with one of the conditions of interest during their inpatient hospitalization, after being seen in the emergency department, and this would not be reflected in available data.</s>
          <s>To mitigate this, we used sensitive definitions for these conditions.</s>
          <s>It is important to note that even from primary care data, the prevalence of these conditions was less than population estimates, suggesting veracity to our claim that there is a substantial proportion of patients for whom diagnostic labels are incorrect, even in primary care.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These data were obtained from a convenience sample of participating NYFHT physicians, rather than a representative sample.</s>
          <s>These practitioners differ from others by working in and around a major city, being younger and more interested in research than other Canadian family physicians <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may affect the generalizability of these findings with respect to other family medicine settings such as rural and remote communities.</s>
          <s>The existence of a shared primary care-hospital research database at North York General Hospital is indicative of a close relationship between the hospital and local primary care providers; this relationship is not universal in the Canadian context.</s>
          <s>NYGH has a high degree of achievement in health information technology excellence, operating at Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society level 6.</s>
          <s>It won the Davies Enterprise award in 2016 for outstanding achievement of an organization which has utilized health information technology to substantially improve patient outcomes and value <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Whether this institutional emphasis on health information technology relates to improved documentation of diagnosis is unclear and it is not known the extent to which this affects generalizability.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Some discordant labeling may be due to improved diagnosis; for example, a patient may be initially diagnosed with 'bipolar' in the hospital record, but this is then updated to 'major depressive disorder' in the primary care record reflecting a more appropriate diagnostic label.</s>
          <s>Since data were only available from the emergency department and medical inpatient visits, it is possible that these conditions were simply not recorded during these visits.</s>
          <s>However, since these conditions are associated with such high morbidity and mortality, it is likely these conditions should have been documented in every assessment of their co-morbidities.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>We identified low concordance of diagnostic labeling for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder between primary care and hospital records.</s>
          <s>We also identified missing diagnostic labels across both settings.</s>
          <s>These are high-cost, high-risk conditions that are associated with frequent primary and secondary care visits, as well as frequent hospitalizations.</s>
          <s>It is essential to know in primary care if a patient has serious mental illness, because primary care is the key setting in which prevention takes place for conditions that are the largest contributors to mortality for these patients.</s>
          <s>Future research should identify ways to improve identification of these patients, and to improve diagnostic labeling.</s>
