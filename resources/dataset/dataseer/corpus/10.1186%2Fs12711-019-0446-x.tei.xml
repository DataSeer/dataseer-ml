            <s>Background: Over many years, artificial selection has substantially improved milk production by cows.</s>
            <s>However, the genes that underlie milk production quantitative trait loci (QTL) remain relatively poorly characterised.</s>
            <s>Here, we investigate a previously reported QTL located at the CSF2RB locus on chromosome 5, for several milk production phenotypes, to better understand its underlying genetic and molecular causes.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Results: Using a population of 29,350 taurine dairy cows, we conducted association analyses for milk yield and composition traits, and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield, milk fat concentration, and milk protein concentration.</s>
            <s>Strikingly, protein concentration and milk yield appear to show co-located yet genetically distinct QTL.</s>
            <s>To attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that might be mediating these effects, gene expression data were used to investigate eQTL for 11 genes in the broader interval.</s>
            <s>This analysis highlighted genetic impacts on CSF2RB and NCF4 expression that share similar association signatures to those observed for lactation QTL, strongly implicating one or both of these genes as responsible for these effects.</s>
            <s>Using the same gene expression dataset representing 357 lactating cows, we also identified 38 novel RNA editing sites in the 3′ UTR of CSF2RB transcripts.</s>
            <s>The extent to which two of these sites were edited also appears to be genetically co-regulated with lactation QTL, highlighting a further layer of regulatory complexity that involves the CSF2RB gene.</s>

          <s>In much of the Western world, milk is primarily produced for human consumption by taurine cattle (Bos taurus) dairy breeds.</s>
          <s>Within these breeds, many generations of selection have improved milk production capacity and efficiency.</s>
          <s>However, in spite of numerous recent genomewide association studies (GWAS) e.g., <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , major QTL remain for which no causative gene has been definitively assigned.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Several genes with substantial impacts on milk yield are known, including DGAT1 <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , ABCG2 <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , GHR <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , SLC37A1 <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , and MGST1 <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recently, as part of work presented elsewhere <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , we performed a genome-wide association analysis for milk volume in 4982 mixed breed cattle using a BayesB model <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> and a panel of 3695 variants selected as tag-SNPs representing expression QTL (eQTL) from lactating mammary tissue.</s>
          <s>Of the top three loci explaining the greatest proportion of genetic variance in this model, genes representing the top and second to top effects have been well described for their role in milk production (DGAT1 and MGST1 respectively <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> ), whereas no causative gene appears to have been definitively assigned for the third signal on chromosome 5 between 75 and 76 Mbp.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This locus broadly overlaps QTL that were reported previously for milk yield <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>

          <s>Although no gene has been definitively implicated, Pausch et al. <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> noted significant markers that were located adjacent to the CSF2RB, NCF4, and TST genes, and proposed the latter as the most likely <ref type="bibr">Lopdell et al. Genet Sel Evol (2019)</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">51:3</ref> candidate based on its proximity to the top associated variant.</s>
          <s>Other studies have proposed CSF2RB due to its high level of expression in the mammary gland <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> , or involvement in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other nearby genes that have been suggested to cause these effects also include MYH9 <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> and NCF4 <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Given these observations, and the magnitude and diversity of effects at this locus, the aim of this study was to investigate this region on chromosome 5 in detail.</s>
          <s>By combining information on milk yield and composition with gene expression data from a large bovine mammary RNA sequence dataset, we highlight multiple lactation, gene expression, and RNA-editing QTL that segregate at this locus, and present CSF2RB as the most likely causative gene responsible for these effects.</s>

          <s>The CSF2RB gene (ENSBTAG00000009064) encodes the common beta chain of the receptors for GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and interleukin-5, cytokines that are involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is produced in the mammary gland by alveolar macrophages <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref> where it enhances the bactericidal activity of milk neutrophils <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These receptors form a link in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, operating via JAK2 and STAT5 <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The STAT5 proteins, especially STAT5A, are important for enabling mammopoiesis and lactogenesis <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The NCF4 gene (ENSBTAG00000007531) encodes neutrophil cytosolic factor 4, which forms the p40-phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[52]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Since cows suffering from mastitis produce smaller volumes of milk than healthy cows <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">[57]</ref> , this provides a possible mechanism by which NCF4 could influence milk production.</s>
          <s>A more appealing mechanism is one that involves CSF2RB or NCF4 but outside of a pathogen response context, given that the locus is better known for its impacts on milk production and composition in the absence of overt mammary infection.</s>

          <s>It has been shown that the rhodanese enzyme (in misfolded form) can bind with 5S-rRNA, enabling its import into the mitochondria <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[59]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There appears to be limited literature implicating TST in mammary development and milk production, and given that the gene maps downstream of association peaks in our dataset, and has no prominent eQTL by which to mediate these effects, a role for this gene seems unlikely for QTL in the NZ population.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We have examined a previously implicated chromosome 5 locus for milk yield and composition traits, and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield, protein concentration, and fat concentration.</s>
          <s>Using a large mammary RNA sequence resource, we have conducted eQTL mapping of the locus and show that expression of CSF2RB, a highly expressed gene involved in signalling pathways that are important to mammary development and lactation, appears to be responsible for these effects.</s>
          <s>RNA editing sites were also discovered in the 3′-UTR of CSF2RB, and edQTL for two of these are correlated with one of two co-located but differentially segregating milk yield QTL, which was also in strong LD with a predicted deleterious missense variant in the MPST gene.</s>
          <s>These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the CSF2RB gene, and showcase the mechanistic complexity of a locus that will require further statistical and functional dissection to catalogue the full multiplicity of effects.</s>
