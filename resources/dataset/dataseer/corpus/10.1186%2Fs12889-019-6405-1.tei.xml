            <s>Background: In the United States, worksite wellness programs are more often offered by larger employers.</s>
            <s>The Massachusetts Working on Wellness (WoW) program is an innovative, statewide capacity-building model designed to increase the number of smaller employers (200 or fewer workers) adopting health promotion initiatives.</s>
            <s>This article describes the WoW program design and approaches to recruitment, implementation, and evaluation.</s>
            <s>Methods/design: WoW provides employer training, technical assistance and seed funding, utilizing a Wellness Program Development framework based on recognized good practices.</s>
            <s>For-profit employers with 200 employees or fewer are eligible for and encouraged to apply for a Massachusetts Small Business Wellness Tax Credit.</s>
            <s>During the phase described in this paper, employer organizations applied to the program and committed to designating a champion responsible for program implementation.</s>
            <s>Interventions were to include policy and environmental supports, as well as those targeting individual behavior change through raising awareness and education.</s>
            <s>Supports provided to employers included seed grants for qualifying activities (up to $10,000 with matching required), community linkages, data collection and organization-specific feedback tools, an on-line curriculum supplemented with technical assistance, and an expert webinar series.</s>
            <s>Data collection at multiple time points, from the initial application through program completion, provides information for evaluation of recruitment, planned and completed activities.</s>
            <s>Discussion: This model is grounded in literature on good practices as well as in local knowledge about Massachusetts employers.</s>
            <s>It does not directly address the influence of working conditions, which can affect both worker participation and health behaviors.</s>
            <s>Implementation may be less successful with some organizations, such as those with many workers who are part-time or geographically distributed rather than in a centralized physical location.</s>
            <s cert="0.9921014904975891" id="dataset-1" type="Tabular data">Program evaluation will assess the extent to which WoW achieves its goals.</s>
            <s>The data are expected to increase understanding of the needs of smaller employers and industries not traditionally implementing employee wellness programs.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Among American working adults, chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent health issues.</s>
          <s>These health problems are associated with a number of behaviors including inadequate consumption of healthy foods <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , use of tobacco products <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , and inadequate physical activity <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The workplace can provide an environment of social support with opportunities for direct communication with employees to support and encourage healthy lifestyle choices.</s>
          <s>American workers spend an average of 8.8 h per day in work or work-related activities <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , and many employers are now educating employees on how to adopt healthy lifestyles <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, the workplaces and structures of many jobs have inherent health-diminishing aspects <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Factors such as psychosocial job strain, shift work, and excessive physical work load are related to worker behaviors such as smoking and lack of leisure-time exercise <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Thus the workplace environment itself should be designed to support these choices and to mitigate the stressors that counteract healthy behaviors <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Educational efforts alone are insufficient if the workplace structure, policies, and practices remain unhealthy and unsupportive of healthy behaviors.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Some employers recognize their role in providing workplace policies and practices that protect employees and advance safety, health and wellbeing <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> and are providing worksite health promotion (WHP) programs which include that goal <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Good practices in comprehensive workplace wellness programs include health education, supportive physical and social environments, integration of the worksite program into the organization's structure, linkage to related programs, and worksite screening programs and related services <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The primary model of medical care insurance for working-age adults in the United States is employer-funded, whereby the employer makes group health insurance available to employees and their family members.</s>
          <s>This model provides a financial incentive for some employers to encourage healthy lifestyles for employees, since the costs of medical care for insured employees affect insurance premiums and the employer may pay half or more of their cost <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, group health insurance coverage is less often provided by smaller employer organizations than larger ones <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Group health is a common vehicle for U.S. employers to offer WHP programs to their employees.</s>
          <s>In 2016, 50% of employers nationwide offering health insurance also offered WHP programs, with large employers (more than 200 employees) again being more likely to provide these programs than smaller employers (83% vs. 46%) <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Obstacles to smaller employers offering WHP programs include a muted ability to manage health care costs, as they are rarely self-insured (a scenario in which any savings from reduced medical costs are realized directly by the company).</s>
          <s>Smaller employers have limited discretionary financial resources and limited ability to negotiate volume-based discounts with health promotion vendors.</s>
          <s>They also rarely have the infrastructure of a central human resources department or the skills and knowledge to implement a WHP program.</s>
          <s>Last, research on the effectiveness of worksite health promotion is based on large employers, so the optimal approach for smaller employers is not well documented <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To support improvement in health of working adults, 19 states in the US (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin) have initiated efforts to date to encourage employers to undertake WHP programs.</s>
          <s>All but Alaska, South Dakota, and Vermont provide technical assistance to participating employers.</s>
          <s>Other than Massachusetts, only three states (Arkansas, Colorado, and Wisconsin) provide seed funding to employers for program activities, and only Maine and Oregon offer a tax credit to some or all participating employers.</s>
          <s>From the available documentation, it appears that few or none of these programs target the smallest employers or engage and guide employers to select specific activities which correspond to employees' stated needs and/or interests.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (MA) has a history of supporting workplace wellness initiatives.</s>
          <s>In order to understand the needs of MA employers, three Worksite Wellness Benchmarking Surveys were conducted by the Department of Public Health (DPH) <ref type="bibr">(2008, 2011, and 2014)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results of these surveys helped to inform programmatic aspects of the pilot program in 2008, as well as the current model described here.</s>
          <s>For example, in the 2014 survey, employers identified lack of available financial resources as a barrier to implementing worksite wellness programs <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The survey also revealed that MA employers were not evaluating health promotion programming.</s>
          <s>About 90% of respondents did not have a written strategic plan for worksite wellness; 81% did not set organizational objectives for health promotion; and many employers cited lack of knowledge about worksite health promotion as a barrier to implementing programs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In 2008, Massachusetts launched "Mass in Motion," a multi-sector, statewide obesity prevention initiative designed to help create conditions for healthy living in the places where people live, learn, work and play <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One component of Mass in Motion was a pilot worksite wellness capacity-building program, offered in 2008-2013, called "Working on Wellness" (WoW) (version 1.0).</s>
          <s>Employers received educational content through a delivery format of four full-day, in-person training programs over 12 months, along with individual technical assistance provided to each participating employer.</s>
          <s>This program reached over 60 MA employers with over 55,000 employees <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Experience from the pilot Mass in Motion program generated a number of lessons regarding elements of workplace wellness program design and employer recruitment efforts:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Employers were interested in WHP programs but needed support from experts.</s>
          <s>The in-person training model was time-intensive and expensive to deliver.</s>
          <s>Recruitment techniques would need to reach significantly larger numbers of employers for meaningful public health impact.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Financial resources, especially for small employers, are required to encourage participation.</s>
          <s>Employers want opportunities to share their experiences and lessons learned.</s>
          <s>Evaluation should be built in from the program's inception.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Comprehensive health reform in Massachusetts was enacted in two phases.</s>
          <s>The second one ("Chapter 224"), in 2012, focused on improving the quality of medical care, reducing prevalence of preventable health conditions, and reducing health care costs.</s>
          <s>Among other provisions, Chapter 224 established a Prevention &amp; Wellness Trust Fund (PWTF), investing $57 million into populationbased clinical care coordination and health promotion efforts.</s>
          <s>The Trust supports community-based partnerships comprised of municipalities, healthcare systems, businesses, regional planning organizations, and schools.</s>
          <s>The partnerships are charged to provide research-based interventions to reduce rates of the most prevalent and preventable health conditions; increase the adoption of workplace-based health management programs; and address health disparities in the occurrence and management of chronic conditions.</s>
          <s>Ten percent of the PWTF was designated for worksite health promotion programs, which led to the creation of a large-scalecapacity-building program building on the Mass in Motion employer pilot program and the 2014 Benchmarking survey.</s>
          <s>This program, "Working on Wellness" version 2.0, was designed to help businesses to implement comprehensive, evidence-based worksite health initiatives to create the conditions that enable and support employees to engage in healthy behaviors.</s>
          <s>While the program is not explicitly designed as a safety or hazard removal initiative, employers may also choose to address those aspects that intersect with health promotion under the program framework.</s>
          <s>WoW version 2.0 was offered to employers with customized coaching by program delivery staff and multiple reporting requirements to permit program evaluation.</s>
          <s>Other than the interactive activities (below) and data submission requirements, most of the program infrastructure remains publicly available as WoW version 3.0, a self-directed, on-line curriculum and catalog of information resources (https://mawow.org/).</s>
          <s>(The WoW program is also ongoing in that numerous data analyses of version 2.0 are initiated but not complete.)</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Chapter 224 also established a Small Business Wellness Tax Credit program, offering MA businesses with 200 or fewer employees a state tax credit of up to 25% of the cost of implementing a qualified wellness program ($10,000 maximum).</s>
          <s>To qualify for the tax credit and receive certification, employers must meet certain eligibility criteria (e.g., offer health benefits to all employees, provide legally required workers' compensation insurance) and agree to conform with program requirements (e.g., implement evidence-based interventions) <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The eligibility criteria for WoW were intentionally aligned with the eligibility criteria for the Small Business Wellness Tax Credit program, to maximize the opportunities for small employers in the state.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>This innovative program introduces organizational level capacity-building as a way of achieving worksite health promotion.</s>
          <s>Unlike other models, this model is focused on generating changes at the organizational level, not only at the individual employee level.</s>
          <s>Program design and the curriculum delivered to employers were based on well-grounded public health prevention practice models relevant in the fields of chronic disease prevention (e.g. the CDC Health Impact Pyramid, the World Health Organization <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> ) and occupational safety and health (e.g. the NIOSH hierarchy of controls).</s>
          <s>These models emphasize population-level policies and system changes in which the interventions can benefit most of the population and set the conditions for successful behavior change on the part of individuals.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To meet the challenge of sustaining these programs beyond the intervention period, WoW 2.0 participants were required to establish an internal infrastructure (Champion and Committee) to plan and manage the program, and to form community partnerships.</s>
          <s>Particularly in light of the fact that program recruitment targeted small businesses, these community connections were intended to provide linkages to local resources and services that could be incorporated into the program, as a partial solution to the lack of internal staffing specialists and other resources.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A strength of this approach is the program's ability to reach a large number of employers through the use of on-line materials and group technical assistance.</s>
          <s>Further, the seed funding addressed an unmet need for smaller employers who might not be able to fund such a program themselves.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The evaluation protocol includes numerous points of data collection that were designed to be of use to the participating employers and program providers in real time (as well as to evaluators).</s>
          <s>For example, each employer was provided with an individual summary report of employee self-reported health needs and interests data, which was to be used to customize program prioritization and planning.</s>
          <s>Employers were taught how to use evaluation instruments and data to track their program process and outcomes during the program period.</s>
          <s>Some of the instruments (e.g., Worksite Wellness Evaluation Report) remain available to employers after the program period ended for their own use in ongoing program evaluation and monitoring.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The opportunity for real-time corrections was another strength of the program.</s>
          <s>The enrollment of staggered cohorts allowed for ongoing program review and quality improvements; initial review of experience with the early cohorts could inform program design features to enhance enrollment and participation, as described above.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One notable limitation of program design is the short time frame for direct involvement with each cohort of employers, originally intended to be 10 months.</s>
          <s>For these employers with no prior WHP experience, it was time-consuming to coach them through the stages of start-up, including initial assessment and evidence-informed program planning.</s>
          <s>The third and fourth cohorts had engagement periods extended up to 15 months, but this was still insufficient to provide satisfactory coaching through the later phases of self-evaluation, strategizing about how to build on and revise the initial plan, and planning for Types of interventions implemented (programs and policies); spending.</s>
          <s>Usefulness, value, involvement, and satisfaction levels, recommendations for improvements, challenges, sustainability program sustainability.</s>
          <s>A related issue was the short time frame available at start-up (due to contractual procedures) for developing and launching the program.</s>
          <s>This might also have limited the ability to recruit and enroll organizations, despite expanded efforts for the later two cohorts.</s>
          <s>A caveat regarding the evaluation plan is that the N&amp;I surveys will primarily be used for metrics of workplace-level change.</s>
          <s>This is consistent with the WoW design and purpose, which focuses on the workplace as the locus of change.</s>
          <s>It also reflects the nature of the collected data, as the surveys were completed anonymously by employees on either work time or personal time.</s>
          <s>Baseline response rates were low to moderate, and some organizations have moderately high annual turnover rates; both of these would hamper analysis of within-person changes.</s>
          <s>Further, while respondents were guided to create a unique personal identifier in the baseline survey, failure to reproduce or enter it correctly in the follow-up would also interfere with survey pairing and individual-level analyses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The WoW program emphasizes environmental and institutional changes at the worksite, with the expectation that system-level changes might lead to more sustainable initiatives and long-lasting behavioral changes by individuals.</s>
          <s>However, it does not directly address the influence of working conditions, which can affect both health behaviors <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

          <s>Unhealthy work environments are more common for some population groups; in particular, low-wage workers are more frequently exposed to environmental toxins, safety hazards, and psychosocial stressors in the workplace <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We will attempt to examine whether the prevalence of such exposures exerted any influence on individual participation, readiness for change, or health behaviors.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Workplace HP programs are voluntary on the part of employers in the U.S. Organizations may be more willing to invest resources in full-time and higher-paid workers whom they wish to retain and less likely to do so for the proportion of the workforce that is low-wage or contingent.</s>
          <s>However, it would also be of public health value to develop strategies to reach worksites with low-wage and part-time workers, who may not have group health insurance or paid sick leave, let alone health-promoting environments, as well as those whose work or worksite itself is hazardous.</s>
          <s>The current WoW model has not yet been extended specifically to address those underlying issues.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another important question is whether this model is best suited for employers with a central physical location.</s>
          <s>We have not yet considered whether it would need to be adapted for sectors with a distributed workforce, such as home health aides, construction workers, or commercial drivers.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is hoped that, over the longer term, WoW might stimulate more employers to offer comprehensive wellness programs to their employees and eventually help to reduce the burden of chronic disease and lower health care expenditures in MA.</s>
          <s>This model may provide lessons for MA and other state departments of health in how to achieve sustainable and effective collaborations between government public health agencies, employers, and local community service providers to improve workforce health.</s>
