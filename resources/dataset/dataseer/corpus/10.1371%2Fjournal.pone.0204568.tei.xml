          <s>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a race-specific malignancy.</s>
          <s>It is endemic with a global incidence of &lt;1 per 100,000 person-years in both men and women <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>

            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, in Taiwan, its incidence ranges from 2.8 to 6.6 per 100,000 person-years, significantly higher than that in other countries <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, among head and neck cancers, the incidence of NPC in Taiwanese women and men is in the highest and second-highest, respectively <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although the complex etiology of NPC remains unclear, several epidemiological studies have suggested a significant association between NPC risk and a specific genotype, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and dietary habits <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>

            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, exposure to active smoke, second-hand smoke, domestic fumes, and incense smoke increases the risk of NPC <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>

          <s>The nasal cavity is the main entry point for air pollutants and poisonous gases into the human body.</s>
          <s>However, the risk of NPC in populations exposed to air pollution remains unknown.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study by combining two national databases to assess the risk of NPC in a Taiwanese population exposed to air pollution.</s>

          <s>In northern Taiwan, there were 31 AQMSs, including 1 at Keelung City, 6 at Taipei City, 12 at New Taipei County, 6 at Taoyuan County, 3 at Hsinchu County and 3 at Miaoli County.</s>
          <s>In central Taiwan, the total number of AQMSs was 15 (3 at Nantou County, 6 at Taichung City, 3 at Changhua County, and 3 at Yunlin County).</s>

          <s>The location of the AQMSs was based on population density.</s>
