            <s>Following an anterior cruciate ligament injury, premenopausal females tend to experience poorer outcomes than males, and sex hormones are thought to contribute to the disparity.</s>
            <s>Evidence seems to suggest that the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone may regulate the inflammation caused by macrophages, which invade the knee after an injury.</s>
            <s>While the individual effects of hormones on macrophage inflammation have been studied in vitro, their combined effects on post-injury inflammation in the knee have not been examined, even though both males and females have detectable levels of both estrogen and testosterone.</s>
            <s>In the present work, we developed an in silico kinetic model of the postinjury inflammatory response in the human knee joint and the hormonal influences that may shape that response.</s>
            <s>Our results indicate that post-injury, sex hormone concentrations observed in females may lead to a more pro-inflammatory, catabolic environment, while the sex hormone concentrations observed in males may lead to a more anti-inflammatory environment.</s>
            <s>These findings suggest that the female hormonal milieu may lead to increased catabolism, potentially worsening post-injury damage to the cartilage for females compared to males.</s>
            <s>The model developed herein may inform future in vitro and in vivo studies that seek to uncover the origins of sex differences in outcomes and may ultimately serve as a starting point for developing targeted therapies to prevent or reduce the cartilage damage that results from post-injury inflammation, particularly for females.</s>

          <s>In the present work, we examined the effects of the three principal sex hormones on inflammation and MMP production by macrophages and SFs using a systems biology approach.</s>
          <s>First, we formulated the model in the absence of hormonal effects, using data from more than 40 published reports of in vitro cellular studies to model the cellular and molecular processes that occur in concert in the knee joint after injury.</s>
          <s>After estimating the nominal parameters from these in vitro studies, we performed Latin Hypercube sampling to account for uncertainties in our estimated parameters, generating 2000 model solutions.</s>
          <s>We used the results from those 2000 statistically varied solutions to compare our model results to independent experimental data post hoc.</s>
          <s>For this comparison, we found that our results captured the salient features of data from the only available in vivo study that reported the time course of cytokine concentration in the synovium after an acute ACL injury <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37]</ref> for a select subset of substances in our model <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Further, we found that the rest of the substances in our model appear to agree with concentration data from single time points after ACL injury (S1 <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig and S4</ref>
            <ref type="table">Table)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Following formulation, statistical variation, and comparison to independent experimental data, we used the model to investigate the effects of single concentrations of estrogen, estrogen plus progesterone, and testosterone on the inflammatory response.</s>
          <s>Our simulation results indicated that estrogen led to a pro-inflammatory effect, testosterone led to an anti-inflammatory effect, and progesterone had little influence on the post-injury inflammatory response.</s>
          <s>However, because males and females have non-negligible levels of both estrogen and testosterone, we also used Latin Hypercube Sampling to generate a range of solutions that could result from typical hormone concentrations.</s>
          <s>We found that female combinations of estrogen and testosterone ("Female Low E" and "Female Peak E" conditions) both led to higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and TNF-α and lower concentrations of IL-10 compared to the "Male" condition.</s>
          <s>Further, model simulations indicated that the "Female Peak E" condition led to increased MMP-1 production compared with the "Male" condition.</s>
          <s>Together, these results suggest that estrogen, which varies in concentration through the menstrual cycle, has the potential to affect the course of the inflammatory process after knee injury.</s>
          <s>To our knowledge, this is the first model that can be used as a platform to study hormonal influences on post-injury inflammation while addressing some of the biological complexity of the postinjury synovium.</s>

          <s>Kruskal-Wallis testing and post hoc Mann-Whitney U testing (with the Bonferroni correction) reveal highly significant differences between hormonal conditions at nearly all time points for all substances (analysis included in S1 Scripts).</s>
          <s>For IL-1β, IL-10, and MMP-1, there are significant differences between every possible hormone pair: "Male" is significantly different from "Female Peak E;" "Male" is significantly different from "Female Low E;" and "Female Peak E" is significantly different from "Female Low E." The difference in MMP-1 concentration between "Male" and "Female Low E" lose significance at t = 19 days and t = 20 days.</s>
          <s>TNF-α is the only exception, as it shows no significant differences between "Female Low E" and "Female Peak E" at any time point.</s>
          <s>Further, no differences exist between hormone conditions t = 0 days, since the initial conditions are the same, regardless of the hormone treatment.</s>
          <s>coefficients and feedback parameters, which we determined based on simplifying assumptions and limited data from numerous independent in vitro experiments.</s>
          <s>One simplifying assumption is that the effects seen in isolated in vitro experiments will not qualitatively change as the environment becomes more complex.</s>
          <s>For example, we assume that a parameter for uptake of one substance does not change in the presence of another substance, and that the functional forms of feedback regulation do not change as the environment changes.</s>
          <s>These assumptions make it tractable to study the inflammatory response when multiple cell types and multiple hormones are present, since it is experimentally complex, even intractable, to conduct multi-variate in vitro experiments that emulate the real biological state of the injured knee joint.</s>
          <s>Thus, we argue that the present model represents a first step toward understanding post-injury knee inflammation at the systems level that would otherwise be quite difficult to examine experimentally.</s>

        <p>

          <s>Furthermore, we chose to exclude damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from our analysis, even though they can play an important role in the joint after ACL injury and during the initiation and progression of OA.</s>
          <s>DAMPs, which can result from tissue damage, can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) and perpetuate inflammation in the long term <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Additionally, the present work only addresses hormonal effects associated with pre-menopausal females that do not use exogenous hormones (hormonal contraceptives).</s>
          <s>We narrowed the focus of this study to this group for several reasons.</s>
          <s>First, post-menopausal females appear to have increased risk of osteoarthritis for reasons that are not completely understood <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[49]</ref> , and those risk factors may affect the inflammatory response under investigation.</s>
          <s>Second, formulations of hormonal contraceptives vary widely, particularly for the progestins.</s>
          <s>Some formulations of progestin have androgenic effects while others appear to have anti-androgenic effects <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[50]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In either case, the research community does not quantitatively understand the effects of the synthetic progestins on macrophage and SF production of cytokines and MMPs well enough to allow a thorough, model-based synthesis.</s>
          <s>Finally, we did not examine the effects of hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle, though these effects are the subject of ongoing work.</s>
          <s>Such investigations are beyond the scope of the present work, which sought to establish a model to examine hormonal effects and examine potential differences in the male and female inflammatory response in the synovium after ACL injury.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Emerging research seems to indicate that hormonal effects in vitro may not only depend on the hormones and cell types present, but also may depend on the sex of the donor of the cells; the cellular responses will differ for XX cells compared to XY cells <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results of these studies represent an important step in our understanding of cellular behavior and we should ultimately incorporate them into multi-factorial kinetic models like the present model.</s>

          <s>indicates that sex was not reported in the cited study).</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, the present model represents an important first step toward understanding hormonal contributions to the inflammation that occurs in the knee synovium after an ACL injury, and may serve as a building block for future work that can also account for sex differences in the cellular responses.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The model may also serve as a building block that could help inform the design of future in vivo or in vitro experiments by identifying the relative contributions of hormones, cells, cytokines, and time analytically.</s>
          <s>When designing experimental studies of cytokines, it can be difficult to pinpoint which cytokines are most important to investigate, and experimental costs can rise quickly if too many cytokines are investigated.</s>

          <s>Running the model in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus, we found that most our predictions agreed reasonably with experimentally reported concentrations in healthy knees <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">(Table 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, we note that the experimental confidence intervals for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 extended below zero; that is, the measured error was larger than the mean value of the measurements.</s>
          <s>For example, the mean concentration of IL-6 was 64 pg/mL while its standard deviation was 120 pg/mL.</s>
          <s>Such large errors may be a result of non-normally distributed data or small sample sizes.</s>
          <s>However, despite large variability, these data serve as important points of comparison because few studies report the concentrations of synovial cytokines in healthy knee joints.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We found that our estimate of MMP-9 in the absence of inflammation did not appear to agree with experimental measurements from healthy knees.</s>
          <s>This discrepancy may have arisen either because our model did not incorporate all possible cell types in the healthy joint or because of experimental uncertainties in the study that reported MMP-9 concentration in the healthy joint.</s>
          <s>In our model, we only incorporated SFs during the simulation of the healthy joint and did not include potential effects of the resident macrophages during this particular analysis.</s>
          <s>While the resident macrophages are not polarized toward an inflammatory phenotype in the healthy joint <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[52]</ref> , it is possible that they may produce substances that the SFs do not, such as MMP-9.</s>
          <s>In that case, our model would not have been able to capture the concentration of MMP-9 in the healthy joint because it did not include the synovial macrophages in the healthy state.</s>
          <s>However, experimental uncertainties may have also influenced the MMP-9 measurement, causing experimental concentrations to disagree with the model predictions.</s>
          <s>For example, the study that measured MMP-9 might have left variables uncontrolled that had the potential to influence cytokine and MMP-9 concentrations.</s>
          <s>Such variables may include undetected sub-acute joint inflammation, activity levels on the day of testing, or use of external stimuli like caffeine or alcohol <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[53]</ref>

            <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Our estimate of TGF-β concentration in the healthy state also differed from experimental measurements of its concentration in healthy knees.</s>
          <s>However, we argue that this discrepancy between concentrations in the healthy state is unimportant in the context of the inflammatory process, since the discrepancy of 5.7 pg/mL is only about 1% of the peak concentration of TGF-β.</s>
          <s>Indeed, despite some discrepancies between our estimates and experimental data in the healthy state, the model appears to appropriately capture important aspects of experimentally measured data when we examine the inflammatory response.</s>

          <s>These differences may have arisen because of the model limitations discussed above, or due to experimental constraints of the in vivo study.</s>
          <s>The experimental constraints included the small sample size and the cross-sectional study design in which a different group of people was tested at each time point, making it difficult to infer the time course of cytokine concentrations for a single subject.</s>
          <s>In addition, the experiments utilized mixed groups of males and females, not accounting for hormonal effects.</s>
          <s>Uncontrolled hormonal influences in the in vivo data may have been responsible for the deviations of experimental data from the model results, which we calculated without hormonal influences for the comparison analysis.</s>
          <s>Ideally, the results from the present study could be compared to an experiment that separates males and females and controls for female hormone levels, but no such study exists as of yet.</s>
          <s>The in vivo study by Irie et al. appears to be the only study that reports the time course of cytokine concentration in the synovium after injury, and even so, it reports only a subset of the cytokines that we modeled <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>

        <head n="4.5">Implications of findings and conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>After verification of the model, we performed a preliminary analysis where we considered the effects of sex hormones at single concentrations using the nominal parameter set.</s>
          <s>The purpose of this analysis was to assess whether sex hormones would have any appreciable effect on inflammation before proceeding to a more thorough analysis in which we varied both the model parameters and the hormonal concentrations.</s>
          <s>The preliminary analysis revealed that estrogen treatment increased IL-1β and TNF-α and decreased IL-10 compared to testosterone treatment, suggesting that females, who have higher levels of estrogen than males, may be prone to a stronger inflammatory response after injury compared to males.</s>
          <s>However, females have non-negligible concentrations of testosterone and males have non-negligible concentrations of estrogen, so analysis of isolated hormone effects is inadequate for studying sex differences in the post-injury inflammatory response.</s>
          <s>Thus, we performed analysis where we simultaneously considered estrogen and testosterone at concentrations relevant for males and females.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In our preliminary analysis of isolated hormones, we also found no discernible change in the inflammatory response when we compared the condition with estrogen alone to the condition with estrogen plus progesterone, suggesting that progesterone was unable to attenuate the effects of estrogen.</s>
          <s>This result contrasted with our hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory effects of progesterone would be beneficial in the environment of the injured knee.</s>
          <s>Further, this result was in direct contrast with the findings of other examinations of progesterone effects on inflammation <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Specifically, studies of the female reproductive system have shown that progesterone reduces inflammation at the concentrations found locally in the female reproductive system <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the concentrations in the reproductive tract are substantially higher than those in the synovium (and in our simulations), so it is possible that the concentrations in the synovium were too low to have a meaningful effect.</s>
          <s>Indeed, the antiinflammatory effects of progesterone started to become apparent in our model at a concentration of 31.4 pg/mL (see <ref type="table">S3 Table)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, because we saw no effect of progesterone at concentrations relevant in the synovium, we did not include it in the subsequent analysis of combined hormones.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our analysis of combined hormones revealed that a relative abundance of testosterone in males may reduce TNF-α concentrations, since the "Male" condition led to significantly lower TNF-α concentrations compared to both the "Female Peak E" and "Female Low E" conditions.</s>
          <s>Conversely, estrogen does not appear to have an effect on TNF-α, since no significant difference existed between the "Female Peak E" and "Female Low E" conditions at any time point for the cytokine.</s>
          <s>The lack of estrogen effect seems to suggest that testosterone is the key hormonal regulator of TNF-α in the present study.</s>
          <s>This reduction in TNF-α concentration for males may have the potential to improve post-injury outcomes, since the cytokine was recently identified as a marker for early osteoarthritis, a common long-term consequence of ACL injury <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our analysis of combined hormones also revealed that elevated estrogen ("Female Peak E") seems to exacerbate inflammation compared to lower estrogen ("Female Low E"), even when we include the opposing effects of testosterone at concentrations relevant for females.</s>
          <s>Indeed, we observed that the "Female Peak E" condition led to significantly elevated IL-1β and MMP-1 and led to significantly reduced IL-10 concentrations compared to "Female Low E" at all time points.</s>
          <s>This result suggests that the severity of post-injury inflammation may depend not only on the sex of the patient, but also on estrogen concentration at the time of injury for female patients.</s>
          <s>This result may inform the design of future studies that seek to examine sex differences in post-injury outcomes, since it suggests that inflammation may differ among females, depending on their estrogen levels.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>With this quantitative framework, we aimed to shed light on the mechanisms that may cause increased cartilage damage for females after knee injury.</s>
          <s>Our model results demonstrated that sex hormones could differentially regulate the inflammatory process after an injury and provided a quantitative framework for studying the complexities of the inflammation that may occur after an injury.</s>
          <s>While the results of this study alone do not provide enough evidence to conclusively assert that estrogen will increase MMP production in vivo and, in turn, put females at higher risk of cartilage damage, the results do offer hints toward the mechanism that may underlie poorer post-injury outcomes for females.</s>
          <s>These hints may help inform the design of future in vitro and in vivo studies that will further improve our understanding of the factors that may put females at higher risk of damage to the cartilage and poor long-term joint health and may eventually serve as a basis for developing targeted treatments to reduce inflammation and MMPs, particularly for females.</s>

        <figDesc>Fig 1. A. Depiction of monocyte and macrophage migration and transformation. Injury to the knee causes the production of chemoattractants, such as TNF-α and TGF-β, which lead to monocyte migration from the bloodstream to the synovium. The synovium is indicated by the gray dashed box. Monocytes transform into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. The molecular processes that drive transformation to M1 cells are not modeled. Instead, a 12-hour delay is incorporated into the model as a way to account for the time it takes for monocytes to transform, as previously described [19]. IL-10 drives the transformation of M1 cells to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages [21]. Both M1 and M2 cells can migrate out of the synovium. B. Cellular production and feedback regulation of a subset of the substances incorporated in the model. M1 and SF both produce IL-10, IL-1, IL-6, and MMP-1. IL-10 down-regulates M1 production of IL-1 and IL-6, while IL-1 upregulates SF production of IL-1, IL-6, and MMP-1. IL-6 up-regulates M1 IL-10 and up-regulates M1 IL-1. Estrogen (E) upregulates M1 production of IL-1 and down-regulates M1 production of IL-10 and IL-6, while testosterone (T) up-regulates M1 production of IL-10. Progesterone (P) down-regulates M1 IL-6. M1: pro-inflammatory macrophage. M2: antiinflammatory macrophage. SF: synovial fibroblast. E: estrogen. T: testosterone.</figDesc>
