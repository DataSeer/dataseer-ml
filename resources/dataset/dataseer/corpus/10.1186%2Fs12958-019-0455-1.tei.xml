            <s>Injectable gonadotropins are often chosen as adjunctive stimulation to promote the growth of ovarian follicles in IUI cycles.</s>
            <s>The growing follicles produce estrogen, which induces endometrial proliferation and increased endometrial stripe thickness (EST).</s>
            <s>The association between EST and pregnancy outcome in gonadotropin stimulated IUI is not well studied.</s>
            <s>The objective of this study is to determine if EST can predict pregnancy outcome in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles.</s>
            <s>Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all exclusively gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles performed between 2012 and 2015 at an academic fertility clinic.</s>
            <s>Mean endometrial thickness was compared in positive versus negative cycles using Student T-test.</s>
            <s>Peak EST values were then divided into four groups of &lt; 7 mm, 7.0-10.4</s>
            <s>mm, 10. 5-13.9 mm, and ≥ 14 mm.</s>
            <s>Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders was conducted to assess the impact of peak EST on cycle outcome.</s>

            <s>No significant differences in mean peak EST were observed between cycles that achieved clinical pregnancy or conception and those that did not.</s>
            <s>Division of peak EST into four groups showed a non-linear relationship between peak EST and cycle outcome, with highest rates of positive outcomes between 10.5-13.9</s>

            <s>Conclusion: This is the largest study to date evaluating the effect of peak EST on gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles exclusively.</s>
            <s>The lack of significant difference in peak EST between positive and negative outcomes cycles may be due to the non-linear relationship between cycle outcomes and peak EST.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the first-line treatment for couples with unexplained or mild male factor infertility.</s>
          <s>During an IUI cycle, adjunctive stimulation can be achieved via clomiphene citrate (CC), aromatase inhibitors, or injectable gonadotropins to promote the growth of ovarian follicles.</s>
          <s>Estrogen produced by growing follicles induces endometrial proliferation, leading to increased thickness of the endometrial stripe as measured by transvaginal ultrasound.</s>
          <s>Peak endometrial stripe thickness (EST) has been studied as a predictive factor of pregnancy outcome in IUI, but most studies have focused on CC-stimulated cycles.</s>
          <s>This is due to the fact that CC is a selective estrogen receptor modulator known to have anti-estrogenic activity at the level of the endometrium, where it has been shown to reduce uptake of radioactive estradiol by the uterus, and thus may attenuate the endometrium quantitatively and qualitatively <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several studies have demonstrated that EST is lower in CC-stimulated cycles compared to natural cycles <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In CC-stimulated cycles, this decline in EST may have negative effects on endometrial receptivity and pregnancy outcomes.</s>
          <s>Esmailzadeh et al. demonstrated that peak EST was greater in CC-induced IUI cycles that resulted in pregnancy versus cycles that did not (10.1 +/− 3.0 vs. 7.7 +/− 3.5) <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, Warrington, Faraj &amp; Willett quantified that for every millimeter increase in endometrial thickness, the odds of conception increased 14% when controlling for potential confounders among CC induced IUI cycles <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Unlike CC, injectable gonadotrophins do not alter estrogen receptor kinetics nor attenuate the endometrial lining in the same way.</s>
          <s>Peak EST has been shown to be thicker in gonadotropin-stimulated compared to CC-stimulated cycles <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the same level of thin EST may not be comparable between clomid and FSH cycles.</s>
          <s>Indeed, thin FSH lining may indicate pathological differences compared to a thin clomid EST.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, the association between peak EST and pregnancy outcome in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI has been much less examined.</s>
          <s>Several studies have studied patients stimulated with a combination of CC and gonadotropins and demonstrated variable conclusions about peak EST and pregnancy outcomes <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A recent meta-analysis by Weiss et al. examining EST in IUI cycles found no evidence that EST was associated with chances of clinical pregnancy <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, this study encompassed a heterogeneous mixture of ovarian stimulation methods including CC, letrozole, and injectable gonadotropins.</s>
          <s>In addition, data comparing EST between cycles that were pregnant vs negative were only available for a subset of the studies included for analysis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are few studies looking at gonadotropin stimulation alone, without the confounding influence of CC.</s>
          <s>Yavuz et al. demonstrated a higher clinical pregnancy rate in gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles when peak EST was ≥8 mm, but pregnancy rates were lower in this study than usually quoted (5.8% if EST ≥ 8 mm vs. 2.5% if EST &lt; 8 mm) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, other studies on gonadotropin-IUI showed no significant association between peak EST and pregnancy outcomes <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>

          <s>The lack of significant results when simply comparing peak EST between outcome groups may be subject to three possible interpretations.</s>
          <s>Firstly, there may merely be no difference in peak EST between outcome groups.</s>
          <s>Secondly, statistical significance may not have been achieved due to sample size limitations, although clinically there may still be a true difference in peak EST between outcome groups.</s>
          <s>Lastly, the statistical difference may not have been observed through these initial analyses due to a non-linear relationship between peak EST and cycle outcomes.</s>
          <s>If the association between peak EST and outcomes were to be non-linear, this method of simply comparing EST between two outcome groups would not be appropriate since it would dilute the effect size.</s>
          <s>Previous literature had assumed a linear relationship between endometrial thickness and success rate, which was a limitation in their analyses <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Therefore, we moved on to examine the possibility of a non-linear relationship by splitting peak EST values into four groups.</s>
          <s>We examined the trend in outcome rates across the 4 EST groups, and also compared peak EST among the 4 groups.</s>
          <s>Our initial graphical exploration indicated that the highest rates for both clinical pregnancy and conception were in the peak EST category of 10.5-13.9</s>
          <s>mm.</s>
          <s>The observation of decreased pregnancy rates at both the low and high ends of peak endometrial thicknesses was previously demonstrated by Dinelli et al., who found the highest rates of pregnancy when peak EST ranged from 10 to 11 mm <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Next, we conducted piecewise linear regression using the four peak EST groups using both univariate and multivariate analysis.</s>
          <s>Multivariate analysis included factors previously associated with IUI cycle outcome: the woman's age, number of dominant follicles, peak estrogen level, and the total motile sperm count.</s>
          <s>These findings concur with previous studies that examined predictive factors of pregnancy outcome <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Unique to our study is the discovery of a non-linear relationship between increasing peak EST and pregnancy outcomes.</s>
          <s>We demonstrated higher conception rates with each subsequent category peak EST (&lt; 7 mm, 7-10.4 mm, and 10.5-13.9</s>
          <s>mm) up to 14 mm, past which conception rates declined.</s>
          <s>This may suggest increasing rates of endometrial pathology and/or decreased endometrial receptivity beyond a certain threshold, but larger studies would be required to confirm this trend.</s>
          <s>Our analysis was limited by the relatively smaller amount of cycles in both the lowest (&lt; 7 mm) and highest (≥14 mm), however we believe these to be an accurate representation of the EST distribution within the FSH-IUI population.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The lack of live birth outcome data is also a limitation of this retrospective study.</s>
          <s>Our institutional research ethics board approved collection of retrospective data from our centre, but live birth rates were not reliably collected for this time period.</s>
          <s>Further studies with live birth data would augment the findings of our research study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although peak EST was associated with cycle outcome using the above described analyses, the lack of significance on ROC curve analysis suggests that EST measurement in isolation is a poor predictor of cycle outcomes.</s>
          <s>This is similar to the findings of a previous analysis by <ref type="bibr">Kolibianakis et al.</ref> , that failed to demonstrate the ability of endometrial thickness to predict outcome in CC-stimulated IUI cycles <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>

          <s>clinical pregnancy rates with increasing peak EST, up to 14 mm, beyond which pregnancy rates diminish.</s>
          <s>Though our study did not have a high amount of cycles in these groups, there is an indication that both extremes of EST are associated with lower odds of both clinical pregnancy and conception in FSH-IUI cycles.</s>
          <s>This non-linear relationship makes it challenging to use peak EST in isolation as a prognostic factor of IUI success.</s>
          <s>We have demonstrated from univariate and ROC analysis that absolute EST measurement is a poor predictor of outcome.</s>
          <s>Other than peak EST, clinical pregnancy outcome is associated with other patient and cycle factors including patient age, number of dominant follicles, and total motile sperm count.</s>
          <s>As an isolated measurement, peak EST has little predictive value, and should therefore not be used as the sole indication for cycle continuation or cancellation.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the findings of our study do not support routine cycle cancellation for cycles with a "thin lining" measuring &lt; 7 mm, as clinical pregnancies occur in reasonable frequency under this arbitrary threshold.</s>
          <s>Similarly, we do not advocate for cancellations for a "thick lining" when EST &gt; 14 mm.</s>
          <s>However, we recommend that considerations of endometrial pathology be included when EST measurements are in this range.</s>
