            <s>Additional molecules including CD5, IgM, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II, and neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) were found in sialidase-positive cells independently.</s>
            <s>The real-time PCR results suggest that the primary sialidase in AIRE-positive cells is neuraminidase 2 (NEU2).</s>
            <s>Furthermore, some of the AIRE-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells also clearly showed sialidase activity when a triple staining of sialidase activity, anti-AIRE, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1) was performed.</s>
            <s>Neumedullocytes may present Aire-dependent antigens for negative selection.</s>
            <s>We discuss the negative selection steps in consideration of sialidases and sialic acids.</s>

            <s>The cells were identified in 2004 1 and were so-named in 2008 2 because they were newly discovered neuraminidase (NEU)-positive cells in the mouse thymus and because they exist primarily in the corticomedullary junction or in the medulla 2 .</s>
            <s>Neu-medullocytes can be stained with blue fluorescein by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-5-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid cyclohexylamine salt (X-NANA), an artificial sialidase substrate.</s>
            <s>When the bond between X (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-OH) (or very similar compound 3 ) and NANA (N-acetylneuraminic acid) is hydrolyzed by sialidase, X becomes an insoluble material with blue fluorescence 1,3 .</s>

            <s>These enzymes are widely distributed and are found in viruses, protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and vertebrates 4 .</s>
            <s>Four types of vertebrate sialidases, lysosomal NEU1, cytosolic NEU2, plasma membrane NEU3, and mitochondrial/lysosomal/intracellular membrane NEU4, are well established, and comprehensive reviews discussing them have been published 4,5 .</s>
            <s>However, recent studies in the last ten years have shown that "lysosomal" NEU1 exists in the plasma membrane in many cases under some physiological conditions, and it has emerged as a key actor involved in cell signaling regulation 5-7 .</s>
            <s>Recently, we have shown that NEU1 exists on the cell surface of mouse thymocytes whose natural substrate is CD5 8 .</s>

            <s>In mice, 75% of thymic B cells were shown to be CD5 + and were not stimulated via surface Ig and IL-4 but required direct interaction with T blasts 11 .</s>
            <s>The circulation of B cells through the thymus from the periphery has also been reported, although the number of cells was small 12 .</s>
            <s>Recent studies demonstrated that B cells in the murine thymus can become activated, and it was shown that the autoreactive thymic B cells are efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for cognate self-antigens during T cell negative selection 13 ; B cells that migrate into the thymus express AIRE, upregulate MHC class II and CD80 plate with 25 to 40 µl of reaction buffer containing X-NANA 1 overnight, at 37 °C in a moisture chamber.</s>

          <s>This result is likely due to the enriched mTECs in the E2 fraction.</s>

          <s>Neu1 was also expressed at higher levels in the E2 fraction than in the R fraction like in the case of Aire.</s>
          <s>Thus, among the four types of sialidases, Neu1 and Neu2 appear to have distribution patterns similar to that of Aire.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this study, we addressed the question of whether Neu-medullocytes express AIRE and found that some of them do.</s>
          <s>In reverse, we found that some AIRE + mTECs exhibited X-NANA sialidase-activity.</s>
          <s>These findings expand our understanding of "sialidase-positive cells" in the thymus.</s>
          <s>Sialidase related reports on the thymus are described below.</s>
          <s>Cell-to-cell interactions are important in the function of the immune system, but sialic acids on the cell surface prevent interactions because of their negative charge.</s>
          <s>We assumed the existence of a natural sialidase on the cell surface that was membrane-bound and active at physiological conditions (at neutral pH), on the basis of the observation that sialidase-treated B cells formed large cell aggregations <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> .</s>
          <s>We searched for such a membrane-bound sialidase and found that the mouse thymus exhibited a high level of sialidase activity when compared with other organs, such as lymph nodes or the spleen 1 .</s>
          <s>The membrane-bound form of sialidase that shows a higher level of activity at a neutral pH than at an acidic pH is unique and is never found among the four vertebrate sialidases <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Neu2 from the mouse thymus was cloned, sequenced, and shown to be a unique type of sialidase, Neu2B, that has 6 extra amino acids in the N-terminus <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29</ref> , and only this B type of Neu2 was expressed in the mouse thymus <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>COS cells transfected with cloned Neu2B showed high membrane-bound sialidase activity <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>The biochemical characteristics of the sialidases in the thymus were studied <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31</ref> , and the mRNA expression and distribution patterns for the four types of sialidase in the thymus were studied 2,8 .</s>
          <s>"Neu-medullocyte", a unique sialidase-positive B cell in the thymus, was found via histochemical examinations 1,2 .</s>
          <s>Neu-medullocytes were not found in SM/J mice, which are known to be a sialidase activity-deficient Neu1 a strain 32 and show very low expression levels of Neu2 2 .</s>
          <s>In addition, the sialidase detected with X-NANA must be NEU2 because NEU2 has the highest ability to hydrolyze artificial substrates such as 4-methyl umbelliferyl 5-acetyl neuraminic acid (4MU-NANA) and X-NANA <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>From these, we infer that the sialidases in Neu-medullocytes are NEU1 and NEU2.</s>
          <s>This finding was also supported in this report by the inhibition study <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref> ) and by the expression study of Aire and sialidases <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Now, we discuss the physiological function of Neu-medullocytes.</s>
          <s>We showed that some Neu-medullocytes express AIRE; thus, they are likely to be acting as APCs for negative selection.</s>
          <s>This hypothesis is supported by the evidence of B cells expressing Aire in the mouse 14 or human thymus 15 , as previously discussed.</s>
          <s>Through further examination, we found that some of the AIRE + mTECs that are known to be APCs exhibited X-NANA sialidase activity.</s>
          <s>How do Neu-medullocytes and mTECs differ in regards to physiological functions?</s>
          <s>It has been suggested that murine thymic B cells may enlarge the self-antigen spectrum, because there is only a very limited overlap in TRA expression patterns between mTECs and the other AIRE-expressing cells <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>Indeed, several genes were expressed differently in human thymic B cells compared with their peripheral counterpart <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although we need more quantitative and qualitative analysis on Neu-medulloctes, we could not do it at this moment because of the difficulty of the flow cytometric analysis of X-NANA-stained cells.</s>
          <s>Now the next important question is how the sialidases work in APCs and in the negative selection step; we hypothesize the following.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 1. Removal of sialic acids from T cells.</s>
          <s>Tight interactions between APCs and T cells must be the first step of negative selection.</s>
          <s>To allow tight interactions, the removal of sialic acids from the cell surface must be required.</s>
          <s>Sialic acids of single positive T cells (SPTs), known to be more sialylated than double positive T cells <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34</ref> , can be removed by NEU1 sialidase on Neu-medullocytes as suggested by our recent study <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 2. Tight interaction between APCs and T cells.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although the primary functional components for the interaction are MHC on APCs and TCR on T cells, CD5 and/or Mac-1 on Neu-medullocytes acting as APCs can enhance the interaction after the removal of sialic acids from T cells.</s>
          <s>NEU1 on Neu-medullocytes can remove sialic acids from CD5 on T cells because (1) NEU1 and CD5 exist on Neu-medullocytes, as shown in this study, (2) NEU1 on mouse thymocytes removes sialic acid from <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>The desialylated CD5s on both cells can interact more easily, because the ligand of CD5 is CD5 <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the binding interaction between CD11b/CD18 and ICAM-1 is enhanced by endogenous sialidase activity 37 , Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on Neu-medullocytes and ICAM-1 on T cells 38 will also be enhanced by the desialylation by NEU1.</s>
          <s>Although MHC classII αand β-chains are also sialylated heterogeneously, as shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">39,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40</ref> , NEU1 on Neu-medullocytes may remove the sialic acids from MHC in a cis-manner 4 , if necessary.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Step 3. Apoptosis or other functions of sialidase in negative selection.</s>
          <s>As a result of the negative-selection test for MHC and TCR, if TCR reacts strongly with an MHC that has an ectopic tissue-specific antigen, then the autoreactive T cell undergoes apoptosis.</s>
          <s>NEU3 and NEU4 may help the process because the major functions of NEU3 and NEU4 have been suggested to be apoptosis <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Neu3 has been shown to be expressed at high levels in the thymus, among the many tissues reported 4 , whereas expression of Neu4 was low 4 , as we also observed in this study <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The contributions of NEU3 and NEU4 to the apoptosis of T cells should be clarified concretely in the future.</s>
          <s>It has also been suggested that AIRE-positive mature mTECs are postmitotic and undergo apoptosis <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">41</ref> and that the speedy apoptosis of AIRE + mTECs may be a mechanism to promote the cross-presentation of the array of peripheral-tissue antigens they produce <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">41</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, anti-AIRE antibodies detected many particles (AIRE + particles) inside or possibly outside of the cells <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3M)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These figures might indicate the apoptosis of AIRE + cells.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, the origin of CD5-positive Neu-medullocytes seems to be rather B1 cell (called CD5B cell) because Neu-medullocytes express Mac-1 (CD11b), unlike thymic B cells reported by Perera et al. <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref>

        <figDesc>Expression of NEU1 sialidase on Neu-medullocytes and the effects of sialidase inhibitors. (I) Detection of NEU1 on Neu-medullocytes by anti-NEU1 antibody. The triple stained thymus section from AKR mouse (male, 5 W) was observed at a low magnification by confocal microscopy using the merged image of X-NANA (blue), anti-NEU1 (red) and anti-mouse IgG (green) (A) or a DIC image (B). The area enclosed by the square in A was enlarged and is shown in C-F. (C) X-NANA (blue); (D) anti-NEU1 (red); (E) anti-mouse IgG (green) (F) merged C-E. Scale bar is 100 μm in A and 20 μm in C for C-F. NEU1-positive Neu-medullocytes are indicated by arrows in D. (II) Effect of sialidase inhibitors on X-NANA staining. Thymus total cells from C57BL/6 mice (female, 6 W) were prepared by enzyme treatment, as described in the Methods section, and treated with X-NANA in the presence of sialidase inhibitors (30 µM). Images with the same letter indicate duplicate results. A,A': no inhibitor; B,B': DANA; C,C': NEU1-selective inhibitor C9-BA-DANA; D,D': siastatin B. Scale bar in A is 20 µm for all images.
