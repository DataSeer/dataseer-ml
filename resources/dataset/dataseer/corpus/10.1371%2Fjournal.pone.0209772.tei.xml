            <s>Human Multipotent Stromal Cells (MSCs) are a valuable resource for regenerative medicine and are widely studied.</s>
            <s>They can be isolated from a variety of tissues and differentiate into multiple cell types (multi-potent).</s>
            <s>Many reports have been published using human MSCs and to be able to compare outcome, or be able to identify differences between MSCs, several cell surface markers have been proposed.</s>
            <s>Nevertheless, still many differences remain.</s>
            <s>Gene expression is known to be different between cell stage and origin.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, cells cultured on a culture dish (2D) show different gene expression profiles as compared to cells grown on scaffolds (3D).</s>
            <s>Even the RNA extraction method and the selection of genes used for normalisation have a role in gene expression profiling.</s>
            <s>To be able to compare gene expression data from samples cultured in different dimensions and RNA extracted using a variety of protocols we set out to define a set of reference genes suitable to normalise qPCR data from a very heterogeneous sample set.</s>
            <s>Hereto, Trizol was used to extract RNA from human MSCs cultured in 3D and 2D to validate newly designed and previously published primer sets.</s>
            <s>Subsequently, RNA from fresh human MSC samples and samples stored in RLT-buffer, Trizol or RNAlater was extracted using RNeasy and Trizol methods.</s>
            <s>All samples have been used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their stability after qPCR enabling identification of the most suitable reference gene(s) for normalisation of a heterogeneous sample set.</s>
            <s>The most stably expressed reference genes indicated superior normalisation of MSC marker gene expression over the least stable reference genes.</s>

          <s>Multipotent stromal cells, also known as mesenchymal stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells or medicinal signalling cells <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> (MSCs), hold great promise for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.</s>
          <s>MSCs can be isolated from virtually all post-natal organs and tissues in the human body <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , are plastic adherent whilst maintaining multipotency when expanded, can differentiate in vitro into several distinctive end-stage cell types and possess immunoregulatory PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209772</s>

          <s>and regenerative capacity through secretion of bioactive macromolecules <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because of their relatively easy isolation from many tissues the identity of the true MSC is unknown.</s>
          <s>The definition of the MSC phenotype is focussed on the expression of cellular surface markers (CD105, CD90 and CD73) or the lack thereof (e.g.</s>
          <s>CD45, CD34, CD19 and CD11b) <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These minimal requirements resulted in numerous reports using MSCs with variable outcome regarding maintaining multipotency or differentiation potency and efficiency.</s>
          <s>Other reasons why differences between MSCs can be observed are the age of the donor <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> and the duration of culture of the MSCs <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To properly perform MSC batch analysis, gene expression profiling could be utilised and quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the gold standard.</s>
          <s>Low amounts of starting material are required for qPCR and it has a very wide dynamic range.</s>
          <s>This technique is very useful if the target gene is known.</s>
          <s>If it is unknown which gene(s) will be differentially expressed, microarray might be the preferred method, though its dynamic range is very low.</s>
          <s>An alternative to microarray is RNA sequencing (RNAseq).</s>
          <s>Although a bit more expensive than microarray, the much broader dynamic range, possible discovery of new genes or splice variants and the ability to examine DNA variations are only some of the benefits <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These techniques require the extraction of RNA from MSCs cultured in 2D (on culture dish in monolayer) or 3D (cultured in a scaffold of any particular material).</s>
          <s>Several methods have been developed to extract RNA from cells and are available through even more suppliers.</s>
          <s>Usually, at least 100ng good quality RNA is required per sample to perform RNAseq.</s>
          <s>For lower amounts or significantly degraded RNA some solutions are available like RNA amplification kits or kits developed for low quality RNA, respectively.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, as these kits can introduce biases, their use should ideally be avoided <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Microarray or RNAseq results should always be confirmed by qPCR and therefore there needs to be additional RNA remaining from the samples that can be used for microarray or RNAseq.</s>
          <s>In general, 1μg RNA is used to obtain 20μl cDNA which is sufficient for the analysis of 4-10 genes by qPCR.</s>
          <s>To obtain high yields and the best quality of RNA for RNAseq and qPCR, protocols for the extraction of RNA need to be optimised depending on the culture condition and possibly on the transportation or storage method.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Quantitative PCR data need to be normalised using reference genes before accurate gene expression analysis can be performed.</s>
          <s>The candidate reference gene (RG) expression should not vary between samples under investigation or in response to experimental treatment <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Two of the most frequently reported RGs for gene expression data normalisation are betaactin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).</s>
          <s>Recently, reports advised to forgo these genes identifying them as unsuitable for accurate gene expression normalisation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">11]</ref> , possibly due to the inability to design gene specific primers allowing to discriminate between the actual gene and their numerous (&gt;60) pseudogenes <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several other genes have been reported as normalisers in MSC gene expression analysis.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, neither does a universal RG exist nor is there a fixed number of defined RGs to use and these should be determined experimentally <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this report we aimed to identify suitable RGs for gene expression normalisation regardless of cell culture dimension, isolation, storage, or RNA extraction method.</s>
          <s>RNA has been extracted from two human MSC lines cultured in 2D and 3D by two different methods (RNeasy and Trizol) after storage in RLT-buffer, Trizol or RNAlater and evaluated for quality (gel electrophoresis) and yield (Nanodrop). Thirteen primer sets have been designed and evaluated as candidate RGs using four different ranking approaches.</s>
          <s>Most rankings indicated TBP amongst the most suitable of all candidate RGs for the normalisation of gene expression data from heterogeneous hMSC sample sets.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, none of the rankings were the same nor could one single gene be nominated as suitable for normalisation of all comparisons.</s>
          <s>Therefore, as advocated already by others <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">14]</ref> , we strongly recommend to use multiple candidate RGs and all or a selection of the validated primer sets described in this report could be suitable for future quantitative PCR studies involving human MSCs cultured in 2D and/or 3D.</s>

          <s>To accurately normalise gene expression data a panel of 12 reference genes has successfully been developed and assessed for their stability in hMSC cultured in 2D and 3D.</s>
          <s>Differences between 2D and 3D cultured samples and the two cell lines used can be observed in the ranking of the candidate reference genes indicating the influence of experimental properties and careful selection of reference genes for normalisation.</s>
