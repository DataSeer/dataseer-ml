        <p>
          <s>Knowledge of developmental programs can be used to direct the differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells towards a desired cell fate.</s>
          <s>Such approaches have successfully generated models of human intestinal epithelium, brain and ear, in each instance forming multicellular self-organising structures termed organoids by mimicking conditions that regulate development of the same tissues during embryogenesis <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, protocols for the generation of human kidney cell types have been developed by ourselves <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> and others <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>

            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Such protocols raise the exciting prospect of disease modelling, toxicity and drug screening in vitro and open new opportunities for regenerative medicine.</s>
          <s>However, the value of stem cell-derived kidney tissue will depend on how faithfully it represents human renal tissue, the degree to which the component cell types mature and the absence of confounding cell types within such cultures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Component cell types present within kidney organoids have primarily been defined by detecting established markers of murine renal cell types by immunofluorescence.</s>
          <s>This has identified cell types with similarity to endothelial cells (CD31 <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the extent to which cell identity is conserved beyond these key markers is unclear.</s>
          <s>Indeed, as these markers were selected based on an understanding of mouse kidney development, they are not definitive evidence of an appropriate human cell type.</s>
        </p>
        <note type="other">)</note>
        <p>
          <s>Similarly, there can be variation between kidney organoid experiments and differentiation protocols as well as between starting cell lines.</s>
          <s>Finally, it is likely that the differentiation is imperfect, resulting in variable populations of off-target cell types.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We recently profiled gene expression in over 8000 single cells from two batches of human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids as part of an analysis of experimental variation in our organoid protocol <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Here, we independently analyse that data to characterise the cellular composition of kidney organoids, extending the expression profiles of expected endothelial and nephron cell types, and identifying subpopulations expressing stromal markers, and off-target glial, neural and muscle progenitors.</s>
          <s>Despite expression of recognisable renal markers, there remains the possibility of broader underlying differences between kidney organoid cell types and equivalent populations in the developing human kidney.</s>
          <s>To directly compare these tissues, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from kidney organoids with publicly available human fetal kidney (hFK) data <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our analysis shows that clusters corresponding to stromal, nephron and endothelial populations included cells from both organoid and hFK origin.</s>
          <s>We further identified populations that were specific to each dataset.</s>
          <s>Substantial conservation of cell type-specific markers between cells from hFK and organoids was observed whereas differences between tissues were obscured by a strong signature that was found to be technical rather than biological.</s>
          <s>After identifying and removing genes associated with that signature, cell type-specific differences in stromal, endothelial and nephron progenitor cells emerged, indicating avenues for improving organoid cell types.</s>
          <s>This analysis extends our understanding of the cellular composition of human kidney organoids and demonstrates that kidney organoids reproduce several cell types found in the developing human kidney.</s>

          <s>Of the three podocyte clusters, CN3 featured conserved expression of recently defined human podocyte precursor markers MAFB, CTGF and OLFM3 <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> though OLFM3 was expressed at higher levels in hFK cells in this cluster and organoid cells had higher levels of several podocyte markers such as PTPRO, SYNPO, VEGFA and WT1.</s>
          <s>hFK and organoid cells in CN0 expressed podocyte markers TCF21, POXDL, ROBO2 and NPHS2 but hFK cells within this cluster maintained expression of human nephron progenitor markers LGALS1 and LYPD1 <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> suggesting these cells may represent a more progenitor-like state than the organoid cells in this cluster.</s>
          <s>A final hFK-specific podocyte cluster formed distinct from the other two clusters which still included podocyte markers such as PTPRO and TCF21 as marker genes but also included genes such as TNNI1, TNNT2 and MYL9, which are expressed in cardiac muscle and podocytes.</s>
          <s>As markers of CN0 and CN7 largely overlap and represent a maturing podocyte state (POXDL, PTPRO, TCF21 AIF1), we investigated disparities between these clusters by performing differential expression analysis (Additional file 9).</s>

          <s>Genes upregulated in CN0 included podocyte enriched genes ANXA1, GPX3, VAMP8, DACH1 and WT1 as well as additional genes related to ATP synthesis that likely relate to the increased growth rate in culture.</s>
          <s>While CN0 expresses established podocyte markers, this cluster may also contain podocyte precursor states or podocytes that have not yet matured into glomeruli.</s>

          <s>This comparative analysis of nephron cell types within kidney organoids and human fetal kidney shows strong conservation of key cell type-specific markers while uncovering differences in the expression levels of key nephron progenitor markers, and a separation of some hFK podocytes from others, potentially reflecting in vivo maturation.</s>
          <s>We did not observe differences in transporter expression or markers of tubule maturation between organoid and hFK samples but that may be due to insufficient depth of profiling in these scRNA-seq datasets.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We performed an in-depth analysis of nephron subpopulations in kidney organoids and found co-expression of a robust suite of established cell type-specific markers.</s>
          <s>Pseudotime analysis of these cell types suggests organoid nephron formation replicates an expected developmental trajectory from nephron progenitor to podocyte and tubular end points.</s>
          <s>We then asked whether there were underlying differences between kidney organoid cell types and equivalent populations in the developing human kidney.</s>
          <s>Organoid and hFK single-cell RNA-seq datasets were integrated and clustered, with cells from both datasets contributing to most clusters.</s>
          <s>Conserved gene expression between organoid and hFK cells within endothelial, stromal and nephron cell types revealed congruence between these cell types demonstrating the capacity of organoids to represent many aspects of the developing human kidney.</s>
          <s>Where immunofluorescence had identified the presence of stromal markers in organoids, our single-cell analysis identified five stromal subpopulations, at least three of which are conserved to some level in the developing human kidney.</s>
          <s>The remaining two may represent renal stromal populations that are simply not represented in the hFK data set due to limited tissue collection, or off-target stromal cell types.</s>
          <s>Further comparisons with more complete human data sets will be required to discern between these options.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A recent study from Wu et al. also used single-cell analysis to analyse our kidney organoid protocol across time and compare it to another organoid protocol and human kidney cell types <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[55]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While the renal populations and congruence with human kidney cell types we identify are consistent with those results, the relative proportion and types of cells captured by that analysis differs somewhat from our findings.</s>
          <s>For example, we detect a muscle progenitor population, where they detected a cluster of melanocytes.</s>
          <s>We detect a glial and a neural cluster and they detected a neural progenitor population and four neuron clusters.</s>
          <s>The proportion of off-target populations in those samples is higher than in our analysis (~20% Wu et al., 6% this study), as is the proportion of tubule to podocyte cells.</s>
          <s>As such, the proportions of cell types generated by the same differentiation protocol are likely to vary between laboratories.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We were unable to resolve a distinct population representing ureteric epithelium in either dataset; however, markers previously used to define this population were under represented in the organoids analysed in this study.</s>
          <s>We previously reported simultaneous generation of presumptive ureteric epithelium and nephron lineages, with the proportions of cell types generated dependent on the timing of exposure to signals that pattern the anterior-posterior axis of the intermediate mesoderm <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The organoids generated for the present study were distinctly posterior and hence contained a lower frequency of epithelial GATA3 + structures.</s>
          <s>Recent studies argue that ureteric epithelium and nephron lineages cannot be generated simultaneously because they arise from distinct regions during embryonic development and instead must be generated using distinct protocols <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Analysis of this epithelial GATA3 + cluster from other kidney organoids is required to further explore the identity of this cell type.</s>
          <s>However, the absence of any ureteric epithelial cluster in the hFK data suggests a resistance of this tubular epithelium to dissociate into single cells.</s>
          <s>This same population may be resistant to single-cell isolation from organoids.</s>
          <s>Hence, this will need to be overcome, perhaps using alternative technologies such as nuclear RNA preparations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Differential expression within combined organoid and fetal kidney clusters identified an upregulation of ribosomal genes in kidney organoids and a heat shock/unfolded protein response in the fetal kidney data, both likely the result of technical artefacts rather than fundamental differences in cell identity.</s>
          <s>Examining gene expression after excluding these sample-enriched genes revealed additional differences between hFK and organoid cell types including notable changes in the levels of expression of nephron progenitor marker genes and in the levels and repertoire of growth factors expressed by stromal and endothelial cells.</s>
          <s>What was not evident in either dataset was the expression of several cell type-specific ligands and receptors that are apparent in analogous single cell datasets from the developing mouse kidney <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example, genes such as GDNF and RET, which encode a key ligand and receptor pair are known to operate in human kidney development as both genes cause renal birth defects when mutated in humans <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Being unable to detect the expression of such important genes in the reference hFK dataset leaves the possibility of important differences between organoid and hFK cell types that may only be revealed with deeper profiling.</s>
