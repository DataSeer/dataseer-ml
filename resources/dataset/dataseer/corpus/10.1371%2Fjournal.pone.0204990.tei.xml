            <s>McPherson's Blau space and affiliation ecology model is a powerful tool for analyzing the ecological competition among social entities, such as organizations, along a combination of sociodemographic characteristics of their members.</s>
            <s>In this paper we introduce the R-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) package Blaunet, an integrated set of tools to calculate, visualize, and analyze the statuses of individuals and social entities in Blau space, parameterized by multiple sociodemographic traits as dimensions.</s>
            <s>The package is able to calculate the Blau statuses at the nodal, dyadic, and meso levels based on three types of information: sociodemographic characteristics, group affiliations (e.g., membership in groups/organizations), and network ties.</s>
            <s>To facilitate this, Blaunet has the following five main capabilities, it can: 1) identify a list of possible salient dimensions; 2) calculate, plot, and analyze niches for social entities by measuring the social distance along the salient dimensions between individuals affiliated with them; 3) generate Blau bubbles for individuals, thereby allowing the study of interpersonal influence of similar others even with limited or no network information; 4) capture niche dynamics cross-sectionally by calculating the intensity of exploitation from the carrying capacity and the membership rate; and 5) analyze the niche movement longitudinally by estimating the predicted niche movement equations.</s>
            <s>We illustrate these capabilities of Blaunet with example datasets.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Blaunet is based on two fundamental concepts in sociology: Blau space and affiliation ecology.</s>
          <s>Blau space rests on the idea that human beings can be represented in a k-dimensional space, where continuous sociodemographic characteristics such as age, income, and years of education serve as the dimensions.</s>
          <s>The dimensions that structure Blau space are socially salient (i.e., they influence association probabilities) and are referred to as Blau parameters <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> in honor of the eminent sociologist Peter Blau.</s>
          <s>Each person's attributes on the Blau parameters define his or her location in the Blau space, which in turn results in the individual's affiliation to social entities such as organizations, cultural tastes, and political preferences, while those entities are more or less competing with one another in this space.</s>
          <s>a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The R-based package Blaunet, accessible via the Graphical User Interface (GUI), is built for Blau space and affiliation ecology models.</s>
          <s>In particular, Blaunet contains an integrated set of tools for accomplishing five important and interrelated tasks: salient dimension identification, niche plotting, Blau bubble (proximity) analysis, niche analysis, and niche dynamics analysis.</s>
          <s>Many of these tools provide an easy way to calculate and visualize some of the widely used techniques necessary for analyzing Blau space.</s>
          <s>The identification of salient dimensions is an especially useful tool as it offers a principled way of selecting the dimensions that constitute Blau space and that underpin this kind of analysis.</s>
          <s>This paper focuses on an overview and description of the functionality of the Blaunet package.</s>
          <s>The remaining paper proceeds in four sections.</s>
          <s>Below we elaborate the theoretical framework underlying Blaunet in greater depth.</s>
          <s>The "Materials and Methods" section describes the installation instructions and the example datasets included in the Blaunet package.</s>
          <s>The "Results" section illustrates some of Blaunet's major capabilities.</s>
          <s>And the "Discussion" section concludes with a discussion of some of Blaunet's present limitations as well as some areas for future development.</s>
          <s>We believe this package will be useful to scholars from a variety of backgrounds as Blau space ideas have diffused from sociology into a diverse array of disciplines, including demography <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , criminology <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> , geography <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , psychology <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , political science <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> , business schools <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , and regional science <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, the Blaunet package should be useful to computer scientists, engineers, and applied scientists who study networks or incorporate sociological insights such as Blau space into their work <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, those interested in the study of organizations and culture, social capital, and affiliation researchers, as well as those who wish to incorporate social space into their models or infer network effects from limited or absent network information may find Blau space approaches and the Blaunet package of value.</s>

        <head>Theoretical framework</head>
        <p>
          <s>The Blaunet package is based on the Blau space and affiliation ecology model, which uses the homophily principle to construct ecological models of a variety of social entities.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Homophily, or the tendency for individuals to associate with those like themselves, has long been considered a key element of social structure <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Two types of homophily are categorized in the foundational work of Lazarsfeld and Merton-status homophily which may be premised on either ascribed (fixed) characteristics of the person (e.g., ethnoracial status, gender, birth date, etc.) or acquired (changeable) social markers (e.g., religion, education, occupation, etc.), and value homophily related to similarities in attitudes, values, practices, and beliefs <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>More recent work has shifted focus to distinguish between structural homophily (i.e., tendency to be sorted into contexts containing similar others) and choice homophily (i.e., tendency to select similar others from among those available) <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Either way, however, there is broad agreement that homophily is a critical driver of association.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Blau's macrostructural theory <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> extended the theory of homophily by arguing that macro-level social structure is fundamentally comprised of micro-level social positions which are parameterized by a family of sociodemographic factors that segregate homogenous people into the same areas in latent social space.</s>
          <s>Likewise, those who are non-identical, but similar, are relatively proximate in this space, with increasing dissimilarity producing decreasing proximity.</s>
          <s>Whether two individuals interact with each other depends on how they are distributed in this latent social space.</s>
          <s>Those positioned in the same areas of the latent social space are more likely to occupy the same foci (e.g., workplace, neighborhood, etc.) <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> and thus are more likely to come into contact with one another <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Miller McPherson named the above-mentioned latent social space "Blau space" in honor of "Peter Blau's fundamental contribution to our understanding of system-level consequences of the organization of the sociodemographic variables" <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Blau space is therefore a k-dimensional hyperspace coordinate system, created by considering the set of k sociodemographic variables as dimensions or axes <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In Blau space, individuals occupy positions determined by their particular combinations of sociodemographic traits.</s>
          <s>Note that not all possible locations are occupied by actual individuals and there can be vast empty areas in which particular configurations of sociodemographic characteristics are not found together (e.g., there are relatively few ten year olds who have a college degree.)</s>
          <s>Based on the homophily principle, individuals are more likely to form social networks with others close to each other in Blau space.</s>
          <s>Because most recruitment to groups/ organizations occur through the social relations of their existing members <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> , and individual networks are constrained by homophily <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , organizations tend to recruit from localized areas of Blau space.</s>
          <s>These areas are termed "niches" and it is through them that social entities, such as organizations, are localized to particular areas of Blau space.</s>
          <s>Thus the Blau space and affiliation ecology model provides a theoretical skeleton around which individuals (e.g., members), social networks (e.g., social relationships among individuals), and the social entities (e.g., groups/organizations) are linked in a common multi-level framework.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>McPherson <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> argues that organizations are social entities competing for their members' time and energy.</s>
          <s>Because the total amount of human time and energy available in an area of Blau space is limited, the pressures of variation, selection, and retention apply to social entities competing in this space.</s>
          <s>Blau space therefore comprises an ecological model of social entities.</s>
          <s>Perhaps not surprisingly, the approach draws heavily on ideas from biological ecology, and can thus be applied in many similar ways.</s>
          <s>For example, if two organizations have overlapping niches, they are drawing from the same pool of potential members, and will compete with each other not unlike how two bacterial colonies compete for nutrients.</s>
          <s>If there are too many organizations situated in a certain area of Blau space (e.g., where the supply of potential members is substantially below the demands of the recruiting organizations), organizational niches will shift towards the relatively low competition areas.</s>
          <s>In such areas, the supply of potential members exceeds the demands of the recruiting organizations, thereby providing an opportunity for organizations to recruit members while avoiding competitive pressure.</s>
          <s>McPherson and Ranger-Moore <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> used this specific idea to predict niche movements of 16 types of voluntary organizations over 9 years, finding an impressive concordance between prediction and observation.</s>
          <s>This perspective, formally restated in mathematical terms by Péli &amp; Bruggeman <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> and evaluated further by McPherson, Popielarz, and Drobnic <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> and Hannan, Pólos, and Carroll <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> , has received significant support and is a productive way to explain change in the mean of the niche, the change in the dispersion of the niche, as well as the change in the density of exploitation of the niche.</s>
          <s>In this way the Blau space and affiliation ecology model has been shown to accurately predict aspects of various types of groups and organizations <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, it has been broadened to include cultural constructs such as preferences, identities, cultural artifacts, meanings, and institutional logics <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref>

            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> and applied to the functional roles of cities <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Lastly the Blau space and affiliation ecology model has also been applied to the development of individual behavior <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> , the formation and evolution of social networks <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The Blau space and affiliation ecology model is advantageous in that it is applicable to almost any social survey variable.</s>
          <s>It provides a metric for understanding the relationships among a wide variety of social entities, and is a dynamic model which combines entities into populations, communities, and (both organizational and cultural) systems.</s>
          <s>It is also a powerful tool for understanding how conventional relational networks and group affiliation dynamics interact with one another <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44]</ref> , even when network data are either limited or unavailable.</s>

          <s>In this section, we discuss the major capabilities of Blaunet for analyzing Blau space and use the example datasets to illustrate them.</s>
          <s>We begin by discussing a tool we developed for constructing Blau space.</s>
          <s>Researchers often have numerous sociodemographic variables at their disposal.</s>
          <s>However, not all of these are appropriate in constructing the Blau parameters.</s>
          <s>It is therefore desirable to have a principled method to identify those variables that can serve as salient dimensions for constructing a Blau space.</s>
          <s>This is the first capability of Blaunet and we discuss it in the "Salient dimension identification" subsection.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Before conducting the analysis, it is useful to visualize how the data "fits together", how the individuals are distributed vis-à-vis the niches in Blau space, as well as how the network ties are distributed.</s>
          <s>Such visualization is also useful after the analysis since it sometimes clarifies certain patterns in the data.</s>
          <s>The challenge is in representing the three types of information.</s>
          <s>This is the second capability of Blaunet and we discuss it in the "Niche plot" subsection.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The main capability of Blaunet is the analysis of Blau space into Blau statuses.</s>
          <s>Based on the diverse types of information (i.e., sociodemographic, affiliation, and network) that can be processed, Blaunet can perform the analysis at three levels-nodal level, dyadic level, and meso level.</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 1</ref> , when a dataset contains only the sociodemographic information, Blaunet can only estimate statuses at the nodal level.</s>
          <s>At this level, Blaunet can generate a matrix indicating the list of individuals who are close to each focal individual in the Blau space using Blau bubble (proximity) analysis (see more details in the "Blau bubble (proximity) analysis" subsection).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>When sociodemographic information and group affiliation information are both available (e.g., similar to the example datasets TwoCities.rda</s>
          <s>and gss74_87.rda),</s>
          <s>Blau statuses at all three levels can be calculated.</s>
          <s>At the nodal level, Blaunet can indicate the Blau status of each individual in relation to the niches (e.g., outsider, insider, exclusive, manifolder, and member/nicher mixing status in each social entity).</s>
          <s>At the dyadic level, Blaunet can calculate the Blau status for each pair of individuals in relation to their niches (e.g., co-nicher, co-outsider, and Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance).</s>
          <s>And at the meso level, Blaunet can perform niche-by-niche analysis, focal niche analysis, and a bivariate correlation analysis for each social entity (see more details in the "Niche analysis" subsections).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>When all three types of information are available (e.g., similar to the example datasets BSANet.rda and schlattr.rda</s>
          <s>&amp; schlnet.rda),</s>
          <s>Blaunet can estimate some additional statuses for each level of analysis.</s>
          <s>At the nodal level, Blaunet can calculate the Blau status of each individual through existing edge(s) (e.g., spanner and number of niches spanned to).</s>
          <s>At the dyadic level, it can calculate Blau statuses of each edge (e.g., straddler and spanner).</s>
          <s>And at the meso level, Blaunet can add some network measures into the bivariate correlation analysis (see more details in the "Niche analysis" subsections).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One of the major goals of Blau space analysis has been to attempt to analyze niche movement over time <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The object of this analysis is to predict how each niche will move in a Blau space due to the competition among various social entities.</s>
          <s>Such niche dynamics analysis requires both sociodemographic and group affiliation information, but not necessarily network information.</s>
          <s>The question of niche dynamics is best addressed with longitudinal data but can also be approached with cross-sectional data.</s>
          <s>This is another capability of Blaunet and we discuss and give examples using both kinds of data in the "Niche dynamics analysis" subsection.</s>

        <head>Salient dimension identification</head>
        <p>
          <s>One of the limitations of Blau space analysis has been that there is no established way of identifying the dimensions that constitute it.</s>
          <s>All sociodemographic characteristics are potential Blau space dimensions, including both continuous characteristics such as age, years of education, income, and occupational prestige, as well as categorical measures such as gender, race, marital status, religion, and birthplace.</s>
          <s>However, which variables a researcher should choose as dimensions is currently determined purely by theoretical or substantive knowledge of the phenomena under study (e.g., theory of organizations, or substantive knowledge about a given area) with no principled method for quantitatively evaluating the choices.</s>
          <s>Researchers typically cite previous work or appeal to theoretically plausible variables that are known to influence association.</s>
          <s>This lack of a principled way of selecting dimensions can introduce bias into the analysis.</s>
          <s>It is possible to inadvertently omit an important dimension or to include a dimension that is not important in a given context.</s>
          <s>A way forward is to try to make the identification of salient dimensions more rigorous.</s>
          <s>This is one of the goals of Blaunet and is one of its most innovative features.</s>
          <s>From a list of theoretically plausible variables, Blaunet uses exponential random graph models <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> to identify variables that influence association probabilities and hence would be good candidates as dimensions to structure the Blau space.</s>
          <s>However, the analyst is advised to bear in mind that these tools are a supplement to researcher judgment rather than a replacement of it.</s>
          <s>Some theoretical guidance should still be used in selecting the appropriate dimensions.</s>

          <s>&amp; schlnet.rda is loaded and all 20 sociodemographic variables are screened to identify the salient dimensions for 3 groups-study group, artistic group, and sports team.</s>
          <s>An automated iterative procedure is implemented in Blaunet for selecting a set of dimensions that is appropriate for constructing a Blau space for the population under study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Theoretically, salient dimension identification is based on two standards.</s>
          <s>First, at the individual level, the selected set of salient dimensions should help explain the membership of an individual in the m social entities.</s>

          <s>In Eq (1), P(Y o2(1,m) = 1 is the probability that an individual is a member of the oth social entity, given a linear combination x of k sociodemographic traits.</s>
          <s>It is not surprising that a few dimensions might be salient for some entities but not for the others.</s>
          <s>We combine the sociodemographic traits that predict (e.g., at the significance level of 0.05 by default) the membership of at least one social entity into a preliminary list.</s>
          <s>Second, at the dyadic level, the homophily on salient dimensions is expected to explain the co-membership of a pair of individuals in m social entities.</s>

          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig 5,</ref> there are 7 remaining sociodemographic characteristics that make up the finalized list of salient dimensions identified by Blaunet.</s>
          <s>Researcher-selected dimensions that also appear on this list can be viewed as being independently supported, though this Blaunet routine is a heuristic and should be supplemented by sociological theory and content-level expertise.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Note that, as of now, only continuous sociodemographic variables can be used as dimensions for constructing Blau space.</s>

          <s>While this method works for organizations to a degree, it is ineffective for individuals, who occupy discrete values.</s>

          <s>There are many features of Blaunet that are not possible to document here, but we hope that this paper, together with the S1 file supplemental manual, serves as a useful introduction to the capabilities of the package as well as the theoretical framework behind it.</s>
          <s>Of course, questions will inevitably arise that are not answered here or in the package documentation.</s>
          <s>For this reason, users can join the Blaunet Users Facebook Group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/</s>
          <s>425015561030239/ to communicate with the authors.</s>
          <s>Although Blaunet provides powerful features for its users, it is far from finished and future developments are envisaged.</s>
          <s>Specifically, we intend to tackle several topics in our future work.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>First, one of the major limitations with existing Blau space techniques is the handling of categorical variables (e.g., gender, race, marital status, etc.), which in the current version can be included in Blau bubble (proximity) analysis but not in niche analysis.</s>
          <s>We are working on a method enabling both continuous and categorical variables to be used in niche analysis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Second, it is reasonable to suppose that salient dimensions may work differently in building the Blau space for different social entities, as well as on constructing the Blau bubble for each individual.</s>
          <s>For example, sport teams might have some minimal criteria for personal athletic ability, while the study group may not be concerned with this dimension.</s>
          <s>In the next version, we hope to more explicitly incorporate weights that adjust the niche and Blau bubble for the relative importance of different dimensions, permitting more accurate models.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Third, the underlying dynamic of this approach has been the competition for members between social entities.</s>
          <s>But a more realistic representation may include other relational dynamics besides competition, such as cooperation or symbiosis.</s>
          <s>For example, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States witnessed cooperation between various religious, political, and civic organizations and the building on each other's membership in civil right movements.</s>
          <s>We are thus considering in incorporating multiple relationship dynamics among social entities in the next version.</s>

        <figDesc>Blaunet provides the niche plotting feature introduced by McPherson [1]. Niches of social entities can be represented in the Blau space as boxes (in 2-dimensions) or cuboids (in 3-dimensions) overlaying the points that indicate the individuals who belong to them.
