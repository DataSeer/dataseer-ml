            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PCNSLs account for 3% of all primary CNS tumors and 1% of NHLs in adults <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Despite intensive treatments including high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) based polychemotherapy with whole brain radiotherapy, the median overall survival (OS) time is approximately 4 years for PCNSLs and shows a poorer prognosis than that of extracerebral DLBCLs <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>PCNSL is a rare subtype of extra-nodal NHL, in which biological significance have been poorly understood, with only a few studies on the CNS signature of PCNSL being reported compared to non-CNS DLBCL <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35]</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[36]</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previous studies have reported that, in DLBCL, the up-regulated miRNAs are miR-155, miR-210, miR-17-5p, and miR-106, whereas the down-regulated miRNAs are miR-150, miR-145, miR-328, miR-139, miR-99a, miR-10a, miR-95, miR-149, miR-320, miR-151, and let-7e, compared to that in normal lymph nodes <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Reduced expression of miR-195 and let-7g also shows good EFS in DLBCL <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study as well, only the down-regulated miR-10a showed poorer survival in PCNSL (S2B <ref type="figure">Fig).</ref>
          </s>
          <s>There is a bias in miRNA expression pattern between PCNSL and nodal DLBCL; miR-9, miR-20a/b, miR-155, miR-340, miR-17-5p, miR-148a, miR-30b/c, miR-27b, miR-26b, miR-146b, and let-7g are expressed in PCNSL; whereas miR-199a, miR-214, miR-432, miR-193b, and miR-145 are expressed in nodal DLBCL <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study also demonstrated that a subgroup associated with higher expression of let-7g, a suppressor of LIN28B stem cell marker <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[39]</ref> , showed poor prognosis in PCNSL tumors <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig 1D and 1E)</ref> .</s>
          <s>A recent study has revealed that increased expression of miR-30c in patients with secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL), compared to those with PCNSL, allows the lymphomas to engraft into CNS, by binding to the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor (CELSR) 3 gene <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In non-CNS DLBCL, exosomal RNAs are considered biomarkers in the blood, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Such serum biomarkers include high expression of miR-15, miR-16, miR-21, miR-29c, miR-155, and miR-210, but low expression of miR-34a within the serum <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The miR-30c derived from the CSF can serve as a biomarker to distinguish PCNSL from SCNSL <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We also examined the expression of 33 above-mentioned miRNAs and their correlation to the OS in this study.</s>
          <s>However, no differences were found except for let-7g and miR-10a <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig 1D and 1B, and S2 Fig)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, we should also address comprehensive expression profiling of miRNAs in a larger population of PCNSL, as well as a non-CNS DLBCL study <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, we selected 16 universally expressed miRNAs from 847 miRNAs detected using microarray, and then determined miR-30d, miR-93, and miR-181b as the CNS miRNA signature for prognosis prediction.</s>
          <s>This study was carried out on specimens from 27 patients with PCNSL and their miRNA expressions data were analyzed using a Random forest model, principal component analysis, and Kaplan-Meier method.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, miR-30d targets programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L), autophagy related 12 (ATG12), serotonin receptor 1F, G-protein coupled (HTR1F) (S1 <ref type="table">Table)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The miR-93 targets programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2, also known as PD-L2), which is related to cancer immunotherapy, and G-protein coupled receptor 137C (GPR137C), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2, also known as MEKK2) in the RAS-MAPK signaling (S1 <ref type="table">Table)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The miR-181b targets retinoblastoma (RB)-associated KRAB zinc finger (RBAK) in the RB signaling (S1 <ref type="table">Table)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Altogether, these data propose that the signature constituted of miR-30d, miR-93, and miR181b is involved in cell death and proliferation, and immune tolerance.</s>
          <s>Our data demonstrated that a subgroup associated with lower expression of miR-93 showed poor prognosis <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig 1D and 1E</ref> ), which could be explained by the genetic interaction between miR-93 and PDCD1LG2.</s>
          <s>Thereby, it might have acquired immune tolerance with PD-L2/PD-1 axis within the PCNSL microenvironments.</s>
          <s>In Hodgkin lymphoma, miR-30d and miR-93 are known to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[44]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the plasma level of miR-93 is associated with higher mortality in 25 patients with lymphoma <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[44]</ref> , which suggests that they are reliable biomarker candidates.</s>
          <s>Differentially expressed miR-30d is also predicted for CNS-DLBCL <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
