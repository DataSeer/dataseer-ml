        <p>
          <s>Schizophrenia, which affects around 1% of the population, is caused by the combined action of genetic and environmental risk factors.</s>
          <s>In recent years, there has been considerable progress in understanding the genetic contribution to disease risk.</s>
          <s>For most patients, this derives from the interaction of a large number of common genetic variants, all individually contributing a small increase in risk <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In other patients, rare variants have a proportionately larger effect.</s>
          <s>Many of the variants associated with schizophrenia, both common and rare, can be functionally aligned with glutamatergic signalling mechanisms <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The proteins involved encompass structural molecules of the post-synaptic specialisation (such as Arc and PSD95) and downstream signalling molecules.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is a substantial body of research indicating that environmental risk factors that act during the pre-, periand early postnatal period are also important in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in adult offspring <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Stressful events, such as psychological trauma, maternal malnutrition, gestational infection and other obstetric complications, cause physiological changes in the developing foetal environment, disturbing the normal course of brain development and inducing structural and functional brain abnormalities which emerge later, in adult life <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, maternal infection and the associated inflammatory response in the mother (and possibly in the developing foetal brain) have been a significant focus of investigation.</s>
          <s>The effect of maternal immune activation (MIA) on offspring in preclinical rodent models (reviewed in <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> ) continues to provide insight into the potential pathogenic mechanisms involved in prenatal infection and the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>MIA using polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C), a double-stranded RNA virus mimetic, is a particularly well-studied method of immune activation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PolyI:C is recognised by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , and a strong inflammatory response is initiated that brings cells to the site of infection in order to help kill the invading pathogen.</s>
          <s>This occurs via the activation of kinase signalling cascades, most prominently the JNK and NF-κB pathways <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> , subsequently upregulating genes coding for pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>

          <s>PolyI:C administration to gestating rodents has repeatedly been shown to induce molecular, structural, physiological and behavioural changes related to schizophrenia in adult offspring <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Reported molecular changes in the offspring include altered microglial staining, altered dopamine metabolism in the striatum, alterations in glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD-67) expression and reduced parvalbumin expression in the prefrontal cortex <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These findings have provided a new impetus to attempts to identify rodent models of aspects of schizophrenia neurobiology with improved construct validity-the combination of genetic risk factors with developmental immune challenge.</s>
          <s>Of the few studies so far reported, mutations in the DISC1 gene have been combined with prenatal <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> or early postnatal <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> administration of polyI:C.</s>
          <s>Another group <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> combined mice with a hemizygous functional deletion of the neuregulin (Nrg1) gene with maternal polyI:C exposure.</s>
          <s>However, the genetic variants studied in this respect to date have no obvious relationship with the environmental stimulus.</s>
          <s>The recent evidence implicating the JNK signalling pathway, and specifically the kinases involved in JNK activation, such as MKK7 (MAP2K7) <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> , ULK4 <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , and VRK2 and TAOK2 <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27]</ref> , in genetic risk for schizophrenia <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28]</ref> is of particular interest, since MKK7-JNK signalling is not only involved in glutamatergic signalling in the CNS <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> , but is also believed to mediate aspects of the innate immune response <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The potential link between genetic risk and environmental risk is clearly intriguing.</s>

          <s>Mice hemizygous for a functional deletion of the Map2k7 gene (Map2k7 Hz mice) show reduced CNS expression of MKK7, along with subtle cognitive deficits characteristic of patients with schizophrenia, including an inability to sustain attention in cognitive tasks <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study tests the hypothesis that Map2k7 Hz mice also show an altered cytokine/chemokine response to maternal immune challenge.</s>

          <s>With respect to brain development <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> and brain gene expression <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> , it has been argued that embryonic day 12.5 may be equivalent to approximately the 54th day (7.8th</s>
