        <p>
          <s>The prices forecast of stock is the most key issue for investors in the stock market, because the trends of stock prices are nonlinear and nonstationary time-series data, which makes forecasting stock prices a challenging and difficult task in the financial market.</s>
          <s>Conventional time series models have been used to forecast stock prices, and many researchers are still devoted to the development and improvement of time-series forecasting models.</s>
          <s>The most well-known conventional time series forecasting approach is autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , which is employed when the time-series data is linear and there are no missing values <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Statistical methods, such as traditional time series models, usually address linear forecasting models and variables must obey statistical normal distribution <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, conventional time series methods are not suitable for forecasting stock prices, because stock price fluctuation is usually nonlinear and nonstationary.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Further, most conventional time-series models utilize one variable (the previous day's stock price) only <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , when, there are actually many influential factors, such as market indexes, technical indicators, economics, political environments, investor psychology, and the fundamental a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 financial analysis of companies that can influence forecasting performance <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In practice, researchers use many technical indicators as independent variables for forecasting stock prices.</s>
          <s>How to select the key variables from numerous technical indicators is a critical step in the forecasting process.</s>
          <s>Investors usually prefer to select technical indicators depending on their experience or feelings for forecasting stock prices despite this behavior be highly risky.</s>
          <s>However, choosing unrepresentative indicators may result in losing profits for investors.</s>
          <s>Therefore, selecting the relevant indicators to forecast stock prices is one of the important issues for investors.</s>
          <s>Financial researchers must identify the key technical indicators that have higher relevance to the stock price by indicator selection.</s>
          <s>Therefore, proposed models must incorporate indicator selection in the stock forecasting process to enhance forecasting accuracy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recently, there have been many new forecasting techniques used to construct efficient and precise machine learning models, but forecasting stock prices is still a hot topic <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To overcome the shortcomings of traditional time series models, nonlinear approaches have been proposed, such as fuzzy neural networks <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>

          <s>SVR utilizes the minimized structural risk principle to evaluate a function by using the minimized the upper bound of the generalized error <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>

          <s>The minimized structural risk principle could get better generalization from limited size datasets <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Further, SVR has a global optimum and exhibits better prediction accuracy due to its implementation of the structural risk minimization principle, which considers both the training error, and the capacity of the regression model <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although SVR has shown a great number of experimental results in many applications such as economic and financial predictions, the main problem of SVR is the determination of its parameters, which requires practitioner experience <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the literature, genetic algorithms (GA) have been successfully used in a wide range of problems included machine learning, multiobjective optimization problems and multimodal function optimization <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>GA is a search algorithm inspired by evolution and is usually used to solve optimization problems.</s>
          <s>Therefore, proposed models utilize GA to optimize the parameters of SVR and obtain better forecasting performance.</s>

          <s>Based on the reasons above, we can confirm that the feature "The Final Best Bid Quote" influences those stock prices forecasting in long testing period.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study has proposed a new time-series model, which considers multifactor and reasonable selected key features into the GA-SVR model.</s>
          <s>The results show that proposed models can improve forecasting accuracy.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the proposed models outperform the listed models in RMSE for Chunghwa Telecom, China Steel, Hon Hai, Cathay Financial Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company datasets.</s>
          <s>In addition, from the findings and discussions, the proposed SR-GA-SVR outperforms the listing models in the short testing period, except Cathay Financial Holdings.</s>
          <s>Moreover, in the long testing period, the MARS-GA-SVR also has better performance.</s>
          <s>We find that the proposed model B almost has better performance than the listing models, especially in larger price fluctuation.</s>
          <s>i.e., the proposed model is more fit the dataset of larger price fluctuation.</s>
          <s>Finally, the research results can provide some suggestion to investors as references.</s>

(3) The results can provide the investment guidance to investors. The proposed model included three blocks as Fig 1, it can be briefly described as follows: 1. Data preprocessing: this proposed model transforms daily basic stock data (open price, the lowest price, the highest price, average price, closing price and volume) into technical indicators. Then utilizes MARS, SR, and KRR methods to select the key indicators. 2. Modeling: Build a forecast model by using SVR and employs GA to optimize the parameters of SVR.</figDesc>
