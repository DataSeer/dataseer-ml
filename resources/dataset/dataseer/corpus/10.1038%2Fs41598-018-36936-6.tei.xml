          <s>The polyJet process, by which photopolymer-ink droplets are jetted and cured with ultraviolet light, was used in a Stratasys multi-material 3D printer (J750).</s>
          <s>The polyJet process allows the creation of fine features with a resolution of about 50 μm in the plane and 15 μm in thickness.</s>
          <s>Geometric design was first created using CAD software and then imported into the Stratasys printer.</s>
          <s>Twisting and rotational bistable components were fabricated using consolidated design without post-assembly.</s>
          <s>To this end, special joints were used to allow 3D printing of whole components; ball joints were employed in twisting components, pin joints in rotational ones (insets in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These joints also allowed us to design tunable bistable components.</s>
          <s>The joint structures were implemented by applying supporter materials to separate and move two consolidated parts.</s>
          <s>Such materials can be dissolved in water or removed easily after printing, e.g., using water jetting, and thus they can enable construction of a complex 3D structure of consolidated parts without an additional assembly process.</s>

          <s>However, these works were mainly limited to simpler translational motion.</s>
          <s>Here, we consider global bistability allowing twisting and rotational movements in 3D-printed structural elements ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>To realize rotational bistability, the exact shape of the deformed beam was calculated by solving the nonlinear equations in beam theory.</s>
          <s>We used commercial materials for our printing.</s>
          <s>The rigid supporting bodies (rectangular bar and central cylinder for twisting structures, outer ring and inner cross for rotational structures) are made of digital ABS or VeroWhite. .</s>
          <s>Two stable states are separated by a welldefined energy barrier.</s>
          <s>To induce transformation into the other state, we should apply the force large enough to overcome this barrier.</s>
          <s>(d) By adjusting bistable structures and material parameters, we can control the barrier height (i.e.</s>
          <s>threshold energy for a shape change), the slope (i.e.</s>
          <s>force), the amount of displacement to induce a shape change, etc.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is a key issue to understand and tailor the shape of bistability energy diagrams for highly controlled reconfiguration.</s>

          <s>The slope in the potential-energy diagram indicates the force applied at a given displacement.</s>

          <s>This can be, for example, used as mechanical switches or actuators for simplified and precise motion controls (e.g., in robots) without the use of complicated position-and force-control systems.</s>
          <s>A bistable structure remains stable over time without energy consumption because it is in a stable-energy position.</s>

          <s>By adjusting bistable structures and material parameters, we can control the barrier height (i.e., the threshold energy for a shape change), the slope of the barrier (i.e., the force required for a shape change) and the amount of initial displacement for a shape change.</s>
          <s>The symmetry in the energy diagram also determines whether the threshold energies are equal in each direction (A → B or B → A).</s>
          <s>If the energy diagram is asymmetric, one direction has a smaller energy barrier than the other, meaning that the transition in one direction is easier than that in the other.</s>

          <s>Twisting bistable components.</s>
          <s>We first consider twisting bistable structures <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Two rectangular bars in the twisting structure are connected by two thin beams (beam thickness: 0.8 mm) and a central cylindrical rod ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2(a)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The two beams are ball-jointed, allowing them to rotate freely.</s>
          <s>With enough energy, the structure can be twisted into the other stable configuration.</s>
          <s>The energy required to overcome the barrier can be modified using other materials, or by changing the thickness of the beam.</s>
          <s>Supplementary Video 1 and 2 show the flipping of the 3D-printed component between these two stable states (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure S1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Flipping between them can be repeated.</s>
          <s>In particular, once we pass the hill of the barrier, the structure transforms rapidly into the other stable state without further energy supply, also called snap-through instability <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>We performed the finite element (FE) analysis and obtained the elastic-potential-energy diagram for this twisting structure <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2(b)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>For simplicity, joints were assumed to be frictionless, and the parts undergoing translational and rotational motion were regarded as rigid bodies.</s>
          <s>We obtained two clear-energy minima separated by an energy barrier.</s>
          <s>However, we note that the shape of each energy-minimum pocket is not exactly symmetric; the potential increases abruptly on the leftmost and rightmost sides of the energy diagram.</s>
          <s>This is because the beams cannot be easily extended further once they are fully straightened.</s>
          <s>The moduli of all printing materials used in the current work were measured using DMA (see Methods).</s>

          <s>Rotational bistable components.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows 3D-printed rotational bistable components.</s>
          <s>The inner cross is connected to the outer ring by four beams.</s>
          <s>The inner part can be inter-rotated into two stable states, while the outer ring is held on.</s>
          <s>To adjust the rotational angles and the shape of the energy diagrams, we used different boundary conditions at the connections between the beams and the inner and outer parts.</s>
          <s>The 3D printing of these rotational structures is more straightforward than twisting the structures, because the whole structure is on the same plane and is thus better for layer-by-layer printing.</s>
          <s>In order to implement the second stable state, it is necessary to know the exact shape of the deformed beam.</s>
          <s>This shape was obtained by solving the nonlinear equation from the beam theory (see Supplementary <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure S2</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To realize rotational bistability, we used either fixed (i.e., clamped) or pinned (i.e., freely rotating) boundaries.</s>
          <s>In <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> , we show rotational components with fixed-pinned beams (upper) and pinned-pinned beams (lower).</s>
          <s>For each case, we computed the energy diagrams again.</s>
          <s>The fixed-pinned structure has an asymmetric energy diagram (blue curve in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3(b)</ref> ), because two stable states A and B have different shapes.</s>
          <s>The state A is an as-printed structure without deformation.</s>
          <s>However, the second stable state (B) is still under stress; therefore, the local minimum at B has a higher energy than A. On the other hand, the pinned-pinned beam has a symmetric energy diagram (red curve in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3(b)</ref> ), because the two stable states now have identical shapes due to the freely rotating, pinned boundaries.</s>
          <s>We can think of another possible case too: that of fixed-fixed beams (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure S3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This configuration also supports bistability, but the rotational angle is very small and the energy barrier is much lower than the others.</s>
          <s>Thus, we do not consider it here.</s>

          <s>Tunable bistable structures with SMP elements.</s>
          <s>Now, we introduce SMP-based tuning elements into our components and demonstrate tunable bistability.</s>
          <s>SMPs can possess various temporary shapes; a temporary shape is fixed during a glass-transition or crystallization process while retaining strains internally.</s>
          <s>By heating above a transition temperature again (the glass-transition temperature, T g , in our case), they soften and the internal strains are released.</s>
          <s>A twisting bistable structure is again 3D-printed; now, however, the central cylindrical rod is printed in a tunable geometry using SMP elements, as shown in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 4(a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This length-adjustable central rod consists of segmented parts and connecting rings.</s>
          <s>The segmented parts can be plugged together while the connecting rings are bent further.</s>
          <s>The half rings in tuning elements are made of a digital SMP material (RGD8630-DM).</s>
          <s>The SMP softens above T g , and we can reduce the length of the central rod by bending the SMP connecting rings and then fixing the shape by cooling it back to room temperature, where the SMP exhibits significant stiffness.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Supplementary Video 3 shows the tuning and flipping of this bistable structure and confirms twisting bistability.</s>
          <s>This temporary configuration is fixed until it is again exposed to heat.</s>
          <s>By adjusting the central rod's length, we can tune the twisting angle <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4(b)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Initially, the whole structure is printed on the same plane.</s>
          <s>If the length of the beams and cylindrical rod are exactly the same, the structure cannot be twisted and all parts will be laid on the same plane -i.e., a flat structure, where bistability does not exist.</s>
          <s>Note that this is different from the previous one ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref> ), in which the twisting component was directly printed out-of-plane using supporter materials, which were then removed after printing.</s>
          <s>Therefore, 3D printing of flat bistable components has the advantages of being more straightforward and saving both time and printing material.</s>
          <s>The length of this central cylindrical rod determines the twisting angle <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 4(c)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This twisting angle can be obtained as a function of the central rod length as explained in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S4</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the central-rod length decreases, the total twisting angle also gradually increases.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Figure 4</ref> (d) also shows how the bistability-energy diagram changes with the central-rod length.</s>
          <s>When the rod length decreases, two energy minima become further separated (i.e., resulting in a larger twisting angle) and the energy barrier grows higher, meaning more energy is required to overcome this barrier.</s>
          <s>However, the overall energy diagram remains symmetric.</s>
          <s>From simulations, we also obtained the bending moment as a function of twisting angle <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Tunable rotational bistable components.</s>
          <s>Now we demonstrate tunable bistability in rotational components.</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 6(a,b)</ref> , we prepared another rotational structure that includes tunable SMP elements in a one arm only.</s>
          <s>This has a pinned-pinned boundary, so the energy diagram was originally symmetric.</s>
          <s>By reducing the arm length, we can now adjust the symmetry of the bistability-energy diagram.</s>
          <s>To this end, we designed the tuning arm to be slightly curved when reduced.</s>
          <s>As shown in the CAD image in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 6(c)</ref> , the tuning arm is segmented into different parts and the end of each joining part is slanted.</s>
          <s>Thus, when the arm is plugged together by bending the SMP connecting rings, it curves naturally.</s>
          <s>By reducing the length of one arm in this way, we can obtain another set of two stable configurations <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 6(b)</ref> ), and thus achieve an asymmetric energy diagram.</s>
          <s>In <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> , the energy diagrams remained symmetric while we adjusted the tuning angles and barrier heights.</s>
          <s>This time, however, we adjusted the symmetry of the energy diagram from symmetric to asymmetric; the barrier in one direction is lower than that in the other.</s>
          <s>The use of SMPs in this manner enhances the tunability and applicability of bistable structures.</s>
          <s>To design a tunable rotational bistable structure, we need to solve equations to determine the required arm length in the tuning element.</s>
          <s>This procedure is explained in <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S5</ref> . .</s>
          <s>When temperature rises up to 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C (blue curves), the red, pink, black curve shows the shape-memory recovery ratio at each temperature.</s>
          <s>We can note that the recovery ratio is larger for higher temperatures.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, we described new ideas and concepts for 3D-printed bistable components, which are important for precise motion control and reconfigurable structures.</s>
          <s>Bistability produces a well-defined energy diagram, which dictates the movement in a pre-determined way.</s>
          <s>Therefore, these bistable structures can be useful for mechanical switches or actuators for simplified and precise motion controls without the use of complicated position-and force-control systems.</s>
          <s>To this end, we have introduced special joints to construct twisting and rotational bistable components without post-assembly.</s>
          <s>Moreover, by introducing SMPs, we demonstrated tunable bistability in both twisting and rotational components.</s>
          <s>By designing proper SMP elements, we could readjust the bistability-energy diagram after printing and achieve tunable bistable structures.</s>
          <s>This significantly increases the tunability and applicability of bistability in various 3D-printed components.</s>
          <s>Introducing SMPs into bistable components can also potentially enable stimuli-responsive motions that are useful for smart and programmable sensors and actuators <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
