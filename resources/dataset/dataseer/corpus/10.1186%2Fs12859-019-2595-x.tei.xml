            <s>Background: Local similarity analysis (LSA) of time series data has been extensively used to investigate the dynamics of biological systems in a wide range of environments.</s>
            <s>Recently, a theoretical method was proposed to approximately calculate the statistical significance of local similarity (LS) scores.</s>
            <s>However, the method assumes that the time series data are independent identically distributed, which can be violated in many problems.</s>
            <s>Results: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to accurately approximate statistical significance of LSA for dependent time series data using nonparametric kernel estimated long-run variance.</s>
            <s>We also investigate an alternative method for LSA statistical significance approximation by computing the local similarity score of the residuals based on a predefined statistical model.</s>
            <s>We show by simulations that both methods have controllable type I errors for dependent time series, while other approaches for statistical significance can be grossly oversized.</s>
            <s>We apply both methods to human and marine microbial datasets, where most of possible significant associations are captured and false positives are efficiently controlled.</s>
            <s>Conclusions: Our methods provide fast and effective approaches for evaluating statistical significance of dependent time series data with controllable type I error.</s>
            <s>They can be applied to a variety of time series data to reveal inherent relationships among the different factors.</s>

          <s>However, it was observed in previous studies that factors can be associated in a subset of time intervals (local) and maybe there are time-delays between the factors.</s>

          <s>For example, Qian et al. <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> proposed a local similarity method to identify potential local and time-shift relationships between gene expression data.</s>
          <s>Ji and Tan <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> suggested a similar procedure that switched gene expression profiles into distinctive changing trend states and calculated the local similarity of the new time series.</s>

          <s>Consider two time series X t and Y t , t = 1, · · · , n, with mean 0. The local similarity analysis <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> was developed to find intervals of the same length from each sequence to maximize the similarity between the two time series.</s>
          <s>In practice, biologists are only interested in a relatively small number of delays.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is required that the starting positions of the intervals differ by at most D, a parameter set by the practitioners.</s>
          <s>A dynamic programming algorithm was developed to calculate the largest similarity score, referred to as local similarity (LS) score.</s>
          <s>The idea was very similar to local sequence alignment in molecular sequence analysis <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In these early studies, statistical significance of the LS score was evaluated using permutations.</s>
          <s>Particularly, one of the time series data was fixed and the other one was permutated many times, and the resulting LS score was obtained using the dynamic programming algorithm.</s>
          <s>The p-value was approximated by the fraction of times the LS score of the permuted data is larger than the LS score of the actual data.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are several drawbacks to permutation test for approximating the statistical significance of the LS score.</s>
          <s>On the one hand, permutation test requires that data is independent at different time points.</s>
          <s>However, in practical problems, this assumption is usually violated and time series data may depend on the values of the previous time points.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the permutation procedure is time-consuming, especially when the p-value precision is small, as the time complexity is inversely proportional to the p-value precision.</s>
          <s>When the number of factors is large, all pairwise analysis of high-throughput data is computationally challenging.</s>
          <s>Therefore, fast and efficient methods to obtain statistical significance approximation of LS score are needed.</s>

          <s>The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology generates massive amounts of sequencing data effectively and economically.</s>
          <s>These developments make large scale human metagenomics studies in a wide range of environment possible.</s>
          <s>A variety of time series data from these studies brings great opportunities for statistical methods to gain insight into the temporal and spatial dynamics of biological systems.</s>
          <s>Therefore, for obtaining more accurate and efficient results, it's necessary to consider the specific property of time series in these studies, such as autocorrelation.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this paper, we developed a theoretical statistical significance approximation of local similarity score for dependent time series data, which substitutes long-run variance based on nonparametric kernel estimate for sample variance.</s>
          <s>Moreover, we developed another method to approximate the statistical significance by using raw data's residuals from a predefined model.</s>
          <s>We considered different dependent time series models to evaluate the type I error and power of our methods compared with others, i.e. original TLSA, permutation test, PCC and SRCC.</s>
          <s>Results from our simulations showed that our methods can control type I error reasonably, but the other four approaches cannot.</s>
          <s>Through simulations, we showed that DDLSA performs better than LSAres for the local AR model, but LSAres works better than DDLSA in the bivariate AR model.</s>
          <s>Therefore, these two methods complement each other under different correlation scenarios.</s>
          <s>Using the MPHM and PML datasets, we demonstrated that DDLSA and LSAres reduced the redundant associations efficiently and captured the most possible relationships among OTUs in metagenomics studies of microbial communities.</s>
          <s>In addition, to obtain more complete sets of significant associations, we suggested to integrate the results from DDLSA and LSAres-apply DDLSA and LSAres to the data set simultaneously and combine the significant associations identified by at least one method as the final significant associations.</s>
          <s>This will reduce false negatives effectively.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, one drawback of LSAres is the determination of the data generative model.</s>
          <s>If we presume data from a more complicated model, residuals from this model may seem like normally distributed but may lose too much information about the original data.</s>
          <s>We have to make a tradeoff between employing complicated models and preserving useful information.</s>
          <s>In the paper, we investigated the impact on type I error by considering AR and ARMA models as alternative models and both of them work well.</s>

        <figDesc>time series are associated in 60% of the time interval (p = 0.6) with correlation (ρ = 0.5), the power of DDLSA is greater than 0.9 when the number of time points n is at least 100. Under the AR model, the power of DDLSA is higher than that of LSAres. Although we only show the results for ρ 1 = 0.5 and time lag D = 0, the results from other simulations with different autocorrelation param- eters and time delays are similar to the result shown here. The simulation results under the local AR model with time delay D &gt; 0 are shown in Additional file 3: Fig. S1-S3. Similar to the simulations under the local AR model, we also investigated the power of DDLSA and LSAres with different parameters under the bivariate AR model and the results are shown in</figDesc>

Ten thousand random samples were generated from the bivariate AR model with ρ 1 = 0.5, ρ 2 = 0.5. The LSAres approach used the residuals from the estimated ARMA(p, q) model by maximum likelihood estimate and order was selected using the AIC criterion. The type I error is 0.05</figDesc>

The first and second columns represent different autoregressive coefficients and number of time points, respectively. Note that we used the residuals from the estimated 
AR(p) or ARMA(p, q) models by maximum likelihood estimate and the order selection was based on the Akaike Information criterion (AIC). The number of permutations was 
1000. The pre-specified type I error was 0.05 and the number of replications was 10000 

time series come from the pre-defined model, such as 
the ARMA model. The simulated results for the power of 
DDLSA and LSAres under the bivariate AR(1) model with 
time delay D &gt; 0 are shown in Additional file 3: </table>
