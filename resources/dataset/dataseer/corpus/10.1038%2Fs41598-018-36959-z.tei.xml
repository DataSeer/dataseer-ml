            <s>The fibrous calcite layer of modern brachiopod shells is a hybrid composite material and forms a substantial part of the hard tissue.</s>
            <s>We investigated how cells of the outer mantle epithelium (OME) secrete calcite material and generate the characteristic fibre morphology and composite microstructure of the shell.</s>
            <s>We employed AFM, FE-SEM, and TEM imaging of embedded/etched, chemically fixed/ decalcified and high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples.</s>
            <s>Calcite fibres are secreted by outer mantle epithelium (OME) cells.</s>
            <s>Biometric analysis of TEM micrographs indicates that about 50% of these cells are attached via hemidesmosomes to an extracellular organic membrane present at the proximal, convex surface of the fibres.</s>
            <s>At these sites, mineral secretion is not active.</s>
            <s>Instead, ion transport from OME cells to developing fibres occurs at regions of closest contact between cells and fibres, however only at sites where the extracellular membrane at the proximal fibre surface is not developed yet.</s>
            <s>Fibre formation requires the cooperation of several adjacent OME cells.</s>
            <s>It is a spatially and temporally changing process comprising of detachment of OME cells from the extracellular organic membrane, mineral secretion at detachment sites, termination of secretion with formation of the extracellular organic membrane, and attachment of cells via hemidesmosomes to this membrane.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Our results show that fibre secretion and fibre shape formation in the modern brachiopod Magellania venosa is a dynamic process.</s>
          <s>It requires a sequence of actions induced and coordinated by outer mantle epithelium cells (OME) in close contact with the forming fibre.</s>
          <s>We reach the following conclusions for the development of calcite fibres and extracellular organic matrix membranes in the shell of the modern brachiopod Magellania venosa:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1.</s>
          <s>It is shown for the first time that extrapallial space between the fibres and the outer mantle epithelium is either non-existent or is extremely narrow and only a few nanometres wide.</s>
          <s>This indicates that fibre formation in Magellania venosa is under tight cellular contact and cellular control.</s>
          <s>Our results do not support mineral transport from the cell by organelles (such as vesicles), but rather indicate that cells secrete calcium and carbonate ions via ion transport mechanisms in the cell membrane.</s>
          <s>A stack of longitudinally cut fibres is shown.</s>
          <s>Fibre growth occurs through the coordinated interaction of neighbouring cells (A to C).</s>
          <s>These are stationary and secrete both, the organic basal lining as well as the calcite of the fibre, and this in the required proportion necessary for the developing fibre (stages 1 to 4).</s>
          <s>Elongation of fibres takes place by repeated continuous changes in the position of growing fibres relative to cells: (i) attached either to the organic membrane lining the convex surface of the fibre or (ii) to the calcite of the fibre.</s>
          <s>The organic membrane lining the fibre is indicated with blue lines.</s>
          <s>Due to the absence of a one-by-one relationship between epithelial cells and calcite fibres, as the shell grows in thickness, each epithelial cell contributes to the formation of more than one fibre and secretes both calcium carbonate and organic material at different portions.</s>
        </p>

          <s>Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:598 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-36959-z 2. Frequently more than one cell contributes to the formation of a calcite fibre at the same time; hence, fibre secretion, growth and shape generation requires communication of adjacent OME cells.</s>
          <s>3. The extracellular organic membrane is secreted only onto the proximal, convex surface of a fibre.</s>
          <s>4. Fibres are not individually and completely sheathed by separate organic membranes.</s>
          <s>5. Secretion of calcite by epithelial cells occurs only at sites where the extracellular organic membrane at the proximal, convex surface of the fibre is absent.</s>
          <s>6.</s>
          <s>Once the extracellular membrane at the base of fibres is secreted, cells of the outer mantle epithelium are attached to these by apical hemidesmosomes.</s>
          <s>This keeps the OME close to the shell and stabilizes those fibre regions that are still in active secretion.</s>
          <s>7. A brachiopod fibre is formed by a cyclic sequence of processes occurring at the apical OME cell membrane:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>(i) local detachment of epithelial cell membrane from the extracellular organic membrane of previously formed fibres, (ii) resumption of secretion of calcite at these detachment sites, (iii) once the final width of the fibre is reached, secretion of an extracellular membrane starting from the edges of the fibre and progressing towards the centre of the convex fibre surface; mineral secretion is suspended where this extracellular membrane is formed, (iv) attachment of the cells via apical hemidesmosomes to the newly formed extracellular organic membrane.</s>
          <s>8. Calcite secretion is suspended where the proximal, organic membrane terminating the secretion of the fibre is formed, and it is resumed in locations where OME cells detach from the extracellular membrane of a previously finished fibre by resorption of the hemidesmosomes.</s>
          <s>9.</s>
          <s>The fibrous layer of rhynchonelliform brachiopod shells is a hybrid fibre composite material that has an overall plywood-like organization with the basic mineral units, the fibres, being assembled in a microstructure resembling the 'anvil-type' arrangement of calcite fibres in bivalves.</s>
          <s>The microstructure also compares to the "brick wall' arrangement of aragonite tablets in bivalve nacre, but rather than being simple "bricks", the mineral units are fibres with the characteristic cross section generated by the process of simultaneous growth of parallel fibres.</s>

        <figDesc>Figure 5. TEM micrographs of chemically fixed and decalcified contact between epithelium and shell calcite in modern Magellania venosa. (a) Mineral formation ceases with the secretion of an organic membrane covering the proximal, convex part of the fibre (black arrows). At these sites, we see two membranes: (i) the apical cell membrane of the attaching OME cell (red arrows), and (ii) the organic membrane lining the basal portion of the fibre (black arrows in b). (b) Site of active fibre secretion, there is only one membrane present and visible, namely the apical membrane of the OME cell (red arrows in a and b), which is tightly attached to the calcite of the forming fibre. Neighbouring cells are connected to each other by belt desmosomes. Note the absence of tonofilaments in cells below those parts of the fibre that are actively secreting. rer: rough endoplasmatic reticulum, m: mitochondria.</figDesc>

Samples were taken from the central region of the shell. (a) With ongoing mineralization, the membrane lining the proximal, convex part of the fibre is not yet developed (red arrows). (b) Apical cell membrane attached to organic membranes of the fibres by apical hemidesmosomes (green arrows), the latter being connected to basal hemidesmosomes (orange arrows) via tonofilaments (tf). Cells below fibres in the process of active mineral secretion do not contain any tonofilaments.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>(ii) The extrapallial space either does not exist or is very narrow what indicates that mineral secretion is under tight cellular control. (iii) At large epithelial lengths, sites of mineral secretion alternate with sites that do not secrete any mineral. (iv) Only the convex part of any individual fibre is covered with an organic membrane. (v) Secretion of the organic lining of the proximal convex surface of the fibre proceeds from the sides to its central part.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Figure 9. Schematic model illustrating calcite fibre elongation for terebratulide and rhynchonellide brachiopods. A stack of longitudinally cut fibres is shown. Fibre growth occurs through the coordinated interaction of neighbouring cells (A to C). These are stationary and secrete both, the organic basal lining as well as the calcite of the fibre, and this in the required proportion necessary for the developing fibre (stages 1 to 4). Elongation of fibres takes place by repeated continuous changes in the position of growing fibres relative to cells: (i) attached either to the organic membrane lining the convex surface of the fibre or (ii) to the calcite of the fibre. The organic membrane lining the fibre is indicated with blue lines. Due to the absence of a one-by-one relationship between epithelial cells and calcite fibres, as the shell grows in thickness, each epithelial cell contributes to the formation of more than one fibre and secretes both calcium carbonate and organic material at different portions.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Sample preparation. Chemical fixation and decalcification. A total of 8 small samples of the shell with the mantle tissue attached were first dissected from central and commissure regions of both ventral and dorsal valves. We used two different fixation media. Fixation medium A was prepared by mixing equal volumes of filtered seawater from the culture of Magellania venosa containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde with a solution of 0.35 mol L −1 saccharose and 0.17 mol L −1 NaCl in 0.2 mol L −1 Na-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.7). Fixation medium B was prepared in the same way, however, with 3.2% paraformaldehyde and 4% glutaraldehyde in the filtered seawater. No differences in preservation of the structures was observed between the fixation procedures and media. After 17 hours in fixation solution at 4 °C, 8 samples, one from each region and valve of the animals, were decalcified for 14 days in a solution containing 0.25 mol L −1 HEPES, 0.05 mol L −1</figDesc>
