          <s>At lowered temperatures such as 200 and 77 K, the rate of the magnetic switching can be substantially reduced and can be suppressed for a long time at 30 K, where a relatively stable ground state can be reached.</s>

            <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the time-dependent magnetic moment of monovacancy graphene at 300 K calculated by the 6 × 6 supercell.</s>
          <s>It is obvious that the rapid magnetic switching, at a time scale of 100 fs, occurs between two states with a high (1.5 µ B ) and low (0.5 µ B ) magnetic moment.</s>
          <s>Analysis of the atomic trajectories indicates that this magnetic switching is directly correlated with the local geometry fluctuations of the carbon atoms close to the vacancy, although vibration of the whole lattice is observable at this temperature (movie S1 in Supplementary Information, SI).</s>
          <s>As known before, two of the carbon atoms nearest to the vacancy (atoms 2 and 3 as labeled in the insert of <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> ) are much closer and re-bond due to the Jahn-Teller distortion, which saturates two dangling σ bonds and leaves the third atom, atom 1 here, an unsaturated σ bond possessing a local magnetic moment of 1 µ B .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the fluctuation of the vertical displacement (h) between atom 1 and graphene plane leads to the magnetic switching directly (red solid line in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>At h ≈ 0 Å, the magnetic moment is basically 1.5 µ B , whereas the magnetic moment jumps to 0.5 µ B when h is larger than 0.3 Å in the 6 × 6 graphene.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the bond lengths between atoms 1 and 2 and between atoms 2 and 3 are also analyzed, which show no correlations with the magnetic transitions as shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> in SI.</s>
          <s>The trajectories at room temperature indicate that the magnetic states of monovacany graphene are thermally unstable, and the instability is directly due to the vertical atomic deformation of the unsaturated carbon atom near the vacancy.</s>

            <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the snapshots of the lattice geometries recorded at t = 0, 500,1500, 2500, 3500, and 4500 fs, which correspond to the magnetic moment of 1.52, 1.32, 0.44, 1.50, 0.40, and1.39 µ B , respectively.</s>
          <s>Although the system jumps between the high and low magnetic states, the planar geometries display little variations, as shown by the top views of the snapshots.</s>
          <s>The in-plane stiffness results from the strong σ bonding within the graphene sheet.</s>
          <s>In the vertical direction, the carbon atoms vibrate up and down due to thermal excitation of the vibrational modes, and the vertical displacement of atom 1 has h = 0, 0.17, 0.60, 0.14, 0.56, and 0.14 Å, respectively.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is clear that the magnetic transition directly results from the vertical fluctuation of the neighboring carbon atom.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the bond lengths between atom 1 and 2/3 are always larger than that between atom 2 and 3 during our 4.5 ps simulations as shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> of SI.</s>

          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> , the number of the magnetic jumps is much reduced in the 4.5 ps simulations and the resident time on the high magnetic moment (green and blue solid lines in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> ) are increased, suggesting that the high magnetic state is the ground state (S g ) and the low magnetic state is a metastable state (S m ) with a higher energy.</s>
          <s>Only at a low temperature of 30 K, the magnetic switching in monovacancy graphene is suppressed state in the 4.5 ps simulations and the system is stabilized on the high magnetic ground.</s>
          <s>At the same time, the vibration of the carbon atoms is much damped, and the vertical displacement h stays smaller than 0.3 Å as shown in movie S2 of SI. <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 3</ref> suggests that lowering temperature is the robust way to achieve stability of the vacancy states.</s>

          <s>The C 2v symmetry of the magnetic ground state implies that the wave functions of the σ and the π vacancy states are orthogonal in space and do not hybridize.</s>
          <s>The two states can thus attain parallel spins according Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity of spin occupation for independent orbitals, giving rise to the high magnetic state.</s>
          <s>In practice, the unsaturated σ state contributes to 1 µ B as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. S2 (a)</ref> of the SI.</s>
          <s>The partial occupancy of the π bands close to the Fermi level contributes less than 1 µ B due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between vacancies at finite concentration.</s>
          <s>When atoms near the vacancy are deformed out of the plane by either thermal fluctuation or shear distortion <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> , the σ and π vacancy bands are no longer orthogonal and become hybridized, which can be clearly seen in their energy dispersion as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. S2 (b)</ref> of the SI.</s>
          <s>The mixing between σ and π band due to inversion symmetry breaking changes therefore the occupation of the two states, leading to the reversal of spin polarization of the π bands near the Fermi level.</s>
          <s>The inversion symmetry breaking is therefore responsible for the magnetic switching and thermal instability.</s>
          <s>It also suggests that symmetry conservation, by any possible means like for example adsorption on substrate, can provide potential ways to stabilize the magnetic states of the defect graphene.</s>

          <s>We present an ab initio MD study on the thermodynamic stability of a single-atom vacancy in graphene.</s>
          <s>At room temperature, the magnetic states of monovacancy graphene is thermally unstable.</s>
          <s>This instability originates from the inversion symmetry breaking associated with local atomic fluctuations perpendicular to the graphene plane.</s>
          <s>It is found that lowering temperature to 30 K can stabilize the system in the high magnetic state.</s>
          <s>This theoretical study provides dynamic insight into thermal stability of the magnetic states of monovacancy graphene.</s>
          <s>It also hints possible ways to control the graphene magnetism by symmetry conservation and thus has implications in spintronic applications.</s>
