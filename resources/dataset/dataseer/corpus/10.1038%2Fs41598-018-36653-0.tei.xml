        <p>
          <s>The force-field generated by a near-field optical trap is analyzed.</s>
          <s>A C-shaped engraving on a gold film is considered as the trap.</s>
          <s>By separating out the conservative component and the solenoidal component of the force-field using Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, it was found that the force is non-conservative.</s>
          <s>Conventional method of calculating the optical potential from the force-field is shown to be inaccurate when the trapping force is not purely conservative.</s>
          <s>An alternative method is presented to accurately estimate the potential.</s>
          <s>The positional statistics of a trapped nanoparticle in this non-conservative field is calculated.</s>
          <s>A model is proposed that relates the position distribution to the conservative component of the force.</s>
          <s>The model is found to be consistent with numerical and experimental results.</s>
          <s>In order to show the generality of the approach, the same analysis is repeated for a plasmonic trap consisting of a gold nanopillar.</s>
          <s>Similar consistency is observed for this structure as well.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Trapping of micron and submicron sized particles have received significant attention in several branches of science including biotechnology 1-3 , physics <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> , and chemistry <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Optical trapping and manipulation schemes are playing an important role in the operation of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accurate modeling of optical trapping forces are becoming more and more important for the design process as the complexity of such devices increase.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Free space optical trapping can be achieved by tightly focusing a laser beam.</s>
          <s>Such setups are known as optical tweezers where particles become trapped near the focus point of the laser beam due to the gradient forces <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To apply sufficient gradient force for successful trapping, the spot size of the focused laser beam must be comparable to the size the particle.</s>
          <s>As a result, the smallest particle that can be trapped is determined by the diffraction limit.</s>
          <s>To overcome this limitation, near-field optical traps have been developed.</s>
          <s>Such traps use the evanescent fields generated by plasmonic nanostructures <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> or dielectric waveguides 2 to create the gradient forces.</s>
          <s>Unlike propagating fields, evanescent fields can be focused beyond the diffraction limit <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> , making it possible to trap particles smaller than the limit of optical tweezers.</s>
          <s>Moreover, compared to the three-dimensional nature of optical tweezers, near-field traps, such as plasmonic traps, are planar in nature.</s>
          <s>This makes it possible to fabricate multiple plasmonic traps on a single substrate for LOC applications <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>By using multiple plasmonic traps on a chip, it is possible to achieve controlled manipulation of nanoparticles <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>Designing such a complex system requires fast and accurate characterization of the force-field and the particle motion near a plasmonic trap.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this paper, we will investigate the nature of the force-field generated by a plasmonic trap and how it effects the trapping dynamics of a dielectric nanoparticle.</s>
          <s>We will mainly focuse on a plasmonic trap consisting of a C-shaped engraving (CSE) on a gold film.</s>
          <s>C-shaped structures produce strong localized field intensity enhancement and can focus light very tightly (&lt;λ/10) <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>
          <s>This can create a strong gradient force that can be utilized for particle trapping.</s>
          <s>As the CSE geometry is asymmetric, the excitation of the structure can be controlled by changing the polarization of the incident light.</s>
          <s>Due to these favorable characteristics, CSEs have been successfully used for plasmonic trapping and manipulation schemes <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>To show that the findings presented in this paper is not limited CSE only, we also consider a second plasmonic structure consisting of a cylindrical gold nanopillar.</s>
          <s>This is also a well known structure that has been successfully used for near-field trapping <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We have computed the force a dielectric nanoparticle experiences near a CSE and near a nanopillar.</s>
          <s>While analyzing this force-field, we have uncovered some interesting properties of plasmonic traps that were not prevously reported in the literature.</s>
          <s>The force-field is decomposed into a conservative/irrotational component and a non-conservative/solenoidal component using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD).</s>
          <s>The force-field is found to have non-negligible solenoidal component and thus cannot be considered as a purely conservative field.</s>
          <s>This finding is contrary to the commonly used assumption of the optical trapping force-field to be conservative <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>This assumption directly affects how the optical trapping potential is calculated, which is often used to characterize optical traps.</s>
          <s>For a conservative field, this trapping potential can be calculated using a line integral.</s>
          <s>For fields with significant solenoidal component, such an approach may not be accurate.</s>
          <s>We show that for the plasmonic traps under consideration, this approach of calculating the trapping potential can give significantly erroneous results.</s>
          <s>It should be mentioned that direct line integration has been used to calculate the trapping potential of near-field traps in many published literature without verifying whether the force-field is conservative or not <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since the two plasmonic structures we considered here both generate solenoidal force components, it is likely that other structures may also exhibit similar characteristics.</s>
          <s>In this paper, we present an HHD based method of calculating the trapping potential.</s>
          <s>It is found that the potential obtained from the proposed approach represents the trap characteristics more accurately.</s>
          <s>Since trap stiffness, trapping range and many other characterizing parameters of an optical trap are often extracted from the trapping potential, accurate estimation of the trapping potential is of significant importance.</s>
          <s>In addition to proposing a method of estimating the trapping potential more accurately, we also relate the position distribution of a trapped nanoparticle with the trapping potential.</s>
          <s>It is well known that the position of a particle trapped in a potential well created by a conservative force-field follows a Boltzmann distribution <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>No similar relationship has been proposed for non-conservative force-fields.</s>
          <s>We posit that for a trapping force-field which is not purely conservative (but the conservative component dominates the solenoidal component), the Boltzmann function can still be used to model the position distribution.</s>
          <s>If the trapping potential is obtained from the HHD and is used as the argument of the Boltzmann distribution, it can accurately model the position of a trapped nano-particle.</s>
          <s>We present numerical and experimental data that support our claims.</s>
          <s>Only a few works have investigated whether a trapping force-field is conservative or not <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, these works focused mostly on optical tweezers.</s>
          <s>To the best of our knowledge, our group is the first to apply the HHD method to analyze near-field traps <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>A detailed analysis on how the trapping potential for a non-conservative force-field can be calculated and used to characterize the position distribution of a trapped nanoparticle has not appeared in the literature.</s>
          <s>By calculating the position distribution using the proposed method, it is possible to estimate the trapping range (area of influence) <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> of a plasmonic trap.</s>
          <s>This can be very useful in the design process of LOC systems containing multiple traps as the necessary spacing between the traps can be estimated from the trapping range.</s>

          <s>A commercial finite element solver (Comsol Multiphysics) is used to simulate the optical response of the structure.</s>
          <s>The field distribution near a plasmonic structure depends on the geometry of the structure, material properties, and the wavelength and polarization of the incident light.</s>
          <s>The electric field intensity enhancement as a function of incident light wavelength is shown in Figs 4(a) and 5(a).</s>
          <s>No nanoparticle is assumed to be present in the system for this simulation.</s>
          <s>It can be observed that the intensity enhancement is maximum at wavelengths near 1064 nm and when the light is y-polarized (90 degree polarized).</s>

          <s>For the CSE structure, the position distribution of a trapped nanoparticle obtained from the experiment (f exp ) is shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> .</s>
          <s>The numerical results from the Brownian dynamics (f Brownian ) and the Boltzmann models are also shown on the same plots.</s>
          <s>The Boltzmann distribution with potential function obtained from the HHD (f Boltz,HHD ) matches closely with numerical and experimental results.</s>
          <s>However, when the potential obtained from direct integration is used in the Boltzmann model (f Boltz,DI ), it gives a result which differs significantly from the rest.</s>
          <s>It can be noted that the experimental distribution along x and y axis both show a slight asymmetry.</s>
          <s>Imperfections in the fabrication process may lead to such variations.</s>
          <s>The same plots for the nanopillar structure are shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> .</s>
          <s>Only numerical data are presented for this structure.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results show that the potential obtained from direct integration is not a good indicator of the trap characteristics when the force-field has large solenoidal component.</s>
          <s>This is a significant finding as direct line integration is a commonly used method to estimate the optical potential <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>As we have shown that the the trapping force-field of a CSE and a nanopillar is not purely conservative, it is reasonable to assume that other plasmonic structures may share similar properties.</s>
          <s>An analysis is necessary to check if a solenoidal component exists in the force-field.</s>
          <s>In such a case, the conservative component can be extracted from the force-field using the HHD.</s>
          <s>We have shown that the scalar potential obtained from the HHD is more representative of the trap behavior.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the error level in the position distribution obtained from direct integration method is smaller for the nanopillar structure than the CSE structure.</s>
          <s>Due to the smaller magnitude of the solenoidal component for the nanopillar structure, the direct integration method introduces less error in estimating the trapping potential.</s>
          <s>If the solenoidal component was zero, then the direct integration method and the HHD method would give identical results.</s>
          <s>For conservative force-fields (e.g.</s>
          <s>optical tweezers), the solenoidal component is negligible and the direct integration method can give results that are consistent with experimental values.</s>
          <s>The asymmetrical geometry of the CSE may play a role in creating larger solenoidal forces.</s>
          <s>Asymmetric geometries can create orbital angular momentum <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">41</ref> and rotational forces 42 which indicate the presence of solenoidal forces.</s>
          <s>Even though the nanopillar structure is symmetric, the field distribution it produces is not symmetric.</s>
          <s>This is because the localized field intensity enhancement of the structure is aligned along the polarization axis of the incident light (as can be seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(d)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This asymmetry in field may lead to the creation of a solenoidal component in the force profile.</s>
          <s>Another finding is that despite the presence of a solenoidal component in the force, the Boltzmann distribution can be used to model the position distribution of a trapped nanoparticle.</s>
          <s>The model is accurate when the potential function from the HHD is used as its argument.</s>
          <s>This finding is interesting as it suggests that the steady state position distribution only depends on one of the components of the force.</s>
          <s>Despite the solenoidal component being non-negligible, only the conservative component determines the position distribution.</s>
          <s>We posit that the solenoidal component induces a rotational/spinning motion which does not affect the steady-state statistics significantly.</s>
          <s>For example, if the nanoparticle experiences some spinning motion around its axis, then the net displacement due to the spinning is expected to be close to zero (assuming no precession).</s>
          <s>The solenoidal component can be thought of as the part of the force that is not related to the net trapping force.</s>
          <s>Working under this assumption, we can concluded that the solenoidal component is unlikely to affect the particle distribution.</s>
          <s>However, further investigation is required to completely explain the phenomenon.</s>
          <s>As the conservative component solely effects the steady state particle position, it is not surprising that the distribution follows the statistics of a purely conservative field.</s>

          <s>The position distribution/spatial spread of a nanoparticle is an important parameter for LOC system design.</s>

            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>To obtain position statistics from Brownian simulation, a large number of independent trajectories must be calculated.</s>
          <s>This requires large computational time.</s>
          <s>The applicability of the Boltzmann model for non-conservative force-fields opens up an alternative approach of obtaining the position distribution.</s>
          <s>The Boltzmann model requires only the computation of the potential function.</s>
          <s>Extracting the potential from the force-field using the HHD requires considerably less computational time.</s>
          <s>So, the Boltzmann model allows faster estimation of the particle position spread.</s>
          <s>This could be useful in the design process of LOC systems.</s>
          <s>If the direct integration method is used to estimate the spatial spread, it would underestimate the spread by a factor of two for the CSE structure.</s>
          <s>The corresponding LOC design would contain twice as many CSEs than actually necessary.</s>
          <s>In some cases, direct integration method may suggest a separation value smaller than what can be fabricated accurately.</s>
          <s>Although this paper analyzes the force-field of a CSE and a nanopillar, the same analysis can be applied to other structures used for near-field trapping.</s>
          <s>The methods used for calculating the force-field and the HHD will be the same for any structure.</s>
          <s>It is reasonable to assume that other plasmonic structures may also generate non-conservative force-fields.</s>
          <s>For those cases, the results presented in this paper can be useful.</s>
