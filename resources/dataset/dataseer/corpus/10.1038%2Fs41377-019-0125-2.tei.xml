          <s>The plasmon lasers that have been reported so far are based on a variety of configurations that combine gain media (mainly, dyes and semiconductors) with metallic nanostructures.</s>

          <s>Recently, plasmon-assisted lasing at the nanoscale was reported in a Nd 3+ -doped solid-state laser (SSL) in association with linear chains of silver nanoparticles (NPs) <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>In that system, the possibility of multiline operation has also been demonstrated.</s>
          <s>Namely, roomtemperature near-infrared (NIR) lasing and, simultaneously, green and tunable blue radiation with subwavelength confinement, have been demonstrated in Nd 3+ :LiNbO 3 crystal via various self-frequency-mixing processes at the metal-dielectric interfaces <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results extend the inherent advantages of SSLs, such as their frequency stability, to subwavelength scales and pave the way for potential multifunctional operation of plasmon-assisted SSLs in applications that require multiplexing, which have yet to be explored at the nanoscale.</s>
          <s>In this context, the search for new designs that involve both rare-earth-based systems and plasmonic arrangements can lead to novel performances and functionalities, thereby further expanding the capabilities of these systems.</s>
          <s>In particular, the incorporation of Yb 3+ -based SSLs into the new class of plasmon lasers is of substantial interest, since it enables the exploitation of the interesting properties of Yb 3+ ions at the nanoscale.</s>
          <s>Yb 3+ is an attractive optically active ion that is relevant to a variety of fields <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>
          <s>Indeed, it can act as a NIR emitter for applications in bioimaging (its emission appears in the second biological window) <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> , as a sensitizer in energy transfer processes for displays <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> , in telecom devices <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> , in NIRphotocatalysis <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> , and in photovoltaics <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As a laser ion, Yb 3+ has several advantages over other rare-earth ions: It has a simple energy-level scheme that consists of two manifolds ( 2 F 7/2 ground state and 2 F 5/2 excited state) separated by an energy of~10,000 cm −1 ; hence, Yb 3+ -doped systems are suitable for laser action in the 1.05-1.07</s>
          <s>µm range.</s>
          <s>This ion also exhibits a low quantum defect and a high quantum efficiency; for the case of Yb 3+ -doped RbTiOPO 4 (Yb:RTP), the quantum efficiency has been determined to be 81% 22 .</s>
          <s>Additionally, due to its 4f 13 electronic configuration, its 4f electrons are less shielded than those of other Lanthanide ions.</s>
          <s>This leads to strong electron-phonon coupling and, hence, to the presence of vibronic or phonon-terminated transitions, which enable the realization of tunability and the generation of ultrashort pulses in the NIR region <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>In a previous work, the authors introduced a novel approach for enhancing the photoluminescence of Yb 3+ ions in RTP crystal.</s>
          <s>As reported, silver nanoparticles connected in disordered plasmonic networks (DPNs) onto the surface of Yb 3+ -doped RTP produced a remarkable enhancement of the overall Yb 3+ photoluminescence.</s>
          <s>This enhancement was mainly due to the increase of the Yb 3+ excitation rate, which was attributed to the nearfield distribution produced by the DPNs <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a plasmoninduced dual-wavelength laser in the hybrid DPN-Yb 3+ : RTP system.</s>
          <s>The simultaneous oscillation of two laser lines appears as a consequence of the effect of the DPNs deposited on the surface of the Yb 3+ -doped RTP laser crystal.</s>
          <s>Under the conditions imposed in our experiment, in the absence of plasmonic nanostructures, lasing occurs exclusively at the 2 F 5/2 (0') → 2 F 7/2 (3) transition at 1075 nm.</s>
          <s>However, in the presence of DPNs, dual-wavelength lasing is realized, thereby allowing simultaneous laser action at 1075 and 1052 nm.</s>
          <s>The emission at 1052 nm is associated with a phonon-terminated transition that is preferentially enhanced by the DPNs, since these plasmonic structures produce not only the excitation rate enhancement of Yb 3+ but also the selective enhancement of the Raman modes of the RTP crystal.</s>
          <s>Thus, by exploiting the near-field properties of the DPNs and the electron-phonon coupling of Yb 3+ transitions, lasing of an additional line is induced by the effect of the plasmonic nanostructures in our SSL system, thereby yielding the dual-wavelength behavior.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Additionally, due to the quadratic nonlinear character of the RTP crystal, the obtained laser emissions at 1052 nm and 1075 nm are self-frequency mixed in the vicinities of the DPNs.</s>
          <s>As a result, multi-wavelength radiation is obtained not only in the NIR but also in the green spectral region at 526 nm, 537.5 nm, and 531.7 nm, due to various frequency mixing processes of the laser lines occurring in the vicinities of the DPNs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results demonstrate the high potential of plasmonic nanostructures for inducing drastic modifications and novel functionalities into the operational mode of SSLs, and hold promise for extending the relevant features of Yb 3+ lasers to the nanoscale.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the demonstration of self-frequency mixing of the NIR-emitted lasing lines is of interest for potential applications in THz radiation generation, which could be realized via nonlinear self-frequency difference due to the high nonlinear coefficients of the RTP crystal and the field enhancement provided by the DPNs 27,28 .</s>
          <s>Wavelength division multiplexing, sensing, and precise spectroscopy are among the applications that could benefit from the effects of plasmonic nanostructures integrated into platforms based on SSLs 29-31 .</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this article, we have experimentally demonstrated plasmon-assisted dual-wavelength lasing operation from a Yb 3+ -based solid-state gain medium, on which Ag DPNs have been deposited.</s>
          <s>The dual-wavelength behavior is achieved in the vicinities of the DPNs, which induce lasing of the phonon-terminated Yb 3+ line at 1052 nm, in addition to the 1075 nm line.</s>
          <s>The analysis of the photoluminescence and the Raman spectra for various configurations shows that the DPNs enable the excitation of the out-of-plane Raman mode that is involved in the phononterminated transition.</s>
          <s>As a result, selective enhancement of the 1052 nm laser transition is obtained at the vicinities of the metallic nanostructures, thereby leading to the simultaneous oscillation of two laser lines in the system.</s>
          <s>Compared with other sophisticated approaches that have been employed to realize dual-wavelength lasing from conventional rare-earth-based systems, the possibility of multi-wavelength lasing operation in the NIR range is demonstrated here via a simple and cost-effective procedure, thereby opening alternative routes for the development of plasmon-assisted multifunctional solid-state lasers.</s>
          <s>In addition, by taking advantage of the nonlinear character of the RTP ferroelectric host, we have demonstrated the possibility of extending the multi-wavelength operation from the NIR to the visible range.</s>
          <s>Multiline green radiation at 526, 531.7, and 537.5 nm is simultaneously achieved at the vicinities of the DPNs via two quadratic nonlinear frequency conversion processes (SFS and SFD) that involve the plasmon-induced laser line.</s>
          <s>The demonstration of self-frequency mixing of the NIR lasing lines further expands the potential of the system for multiplexing applications at various spectral ranges.</s>
          <s>Additionally, the suitability of the system for the selffrequency mixing process, along with the small frequency difference among the emitted wavelengths at the NIR, holds promise for the potential development of compact and low-cost plasmon-assisted coherent THz radiation sources, which have applications in many fields, including medical imaging, optical spectroscopies, communications, and security.</s>
