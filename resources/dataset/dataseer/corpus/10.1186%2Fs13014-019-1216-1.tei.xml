        <p>
          <s>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.</s>
          <s>Approximately 80% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</s>
          <s>Surgery is currently the standard therapy for early stage NSCLC.</s>
          <s>However, patients with severe underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac insufficiency are not eligible for surgical procedures.</s>
          <s>Radiation therapy (RT), including stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has become the most favorable options for these patients <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>With the physical dosimetrical advantage of particle beams and additional biological advantage of carbon ion beams compared with conventional radiation, particle therapy (PT) might be able to achieve better sparing of the normal tissue and even better tumor control and has therefore been used for the treatment of NSCLC patients with impaired pulmonary or heart function <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There are two major techniques implemented for PT: passive scattering (PS) and pencil-beam scanning (PBS).</s>
          <s>Theoretically, PBS can provide better dose distribution than PS in early stage NSCLC <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, PBS was relatively slowly applied to lung cancer worldwide because of the possible inaccuracy of dose distribution caused by the interplay effect, complicated tissue density variation of thorax area under PBS, respiratory motions, and range uncertainties of particle beams.</s>
          <s>Only several patients of early stage NSCLC were mentioned being treated by PBS-proton radiotherapy (PRT) in a previous study <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , no experience has been reported for carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) using PBS technology for early stage NSCLC.</s>
          <s>After investigating how to deal with the interplay effect and delivery uncertainties for lung cancer, we successfully used PBS technique of PT to treat early stage NSCLC.</s>
          <s>In this retrospective study, we present our initial experience and clinical results at Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center (SPHIC).</s>

          <s>The Siemens SyngoÂ® treatment planning system was used for all patients' PT planning.</s>

          <s>Single beam optimization (SBO) or intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT) method was decided to be used in treatment by evaluating delivery uncertainties and doses to critical organs during planning.</s>
          <s>Without the feature of robustness evaluation in the SyngoÂ® system, several steps were applied to reduce the uncertainties.</s>
          <s>First, similar to the experience of MDACC <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , the threshold of 5 mm was selected for motion control in our center.</s>
          <s>Based on the physical experiment on Alderson phantom conducted in our center, the deviation of dose distribution was found to be acceptable (&lt; 5%) when respiratory movement was 4.4 mm or less.</s>

          <s>Third, when planning, physicists will avoid the beam angles passing through the heart and great vessels and keep the beam path less inhomogeneous.</s>
          <s>Forth, for hypo-fractionation plans (fraction dose â¥6 GyE), strategies of repeated SBO which is mimicking the volumetric rescanning <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> , and specific beam PTV expansion were typically used to increse the plan robustness.</s>
          <s>IMPT was only used for lesions with minor motions, or large volumes and irregular shapes.</s>
          <s>Fifth, large sport size (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 10 mm) and decreased iso-energy slice spacing (Grid resolution = 2 mm) were used to increase target dose heterogeneities <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Sixth, 4D plan recalculation and accumulated dose also have been used for hypo-fractionation plans to evaluate dose distribution.</s>
          <s>Last but not least, before the first treatment and every week during treatment, simulation CT and plan recalculation on the latest CT will be conducted for every patient, to check the dose distribution, and replanning was demanded when recalculation revealed poor coverage of targets or overdosing to the OARs.</s>

          <s>Only 1 patient developed local recurrence due to, at least in part, the relatively low BED 10 (77.2 GyE) because of poor baseline pulmonary functions.</s>
          <s>All 3 patients who developed distant metastases had larger tumor size (diameter &gt; 3 cm) with insufficient chemotherapy.</s>
          <s>PT-induced toxicities were mild and relieved quickly after proper medical treatment.</s>
          <s>Only 1 patient who had infectious pneumonia just before the initiation of PT experienced grade 3 RILI and had recovered to grade 1 after hospitalization.</s>
