          <s>Essentially, coupled qubit systems-the quantum analog of classical bits-are moving from being a lab curiosity to fully integrated and usable computing devices.</s>
          <s>We are reaching the point where the uniquely quantum features of entanglement and superposition will enable a solution to problems that are thought intractable to even the most powerful present day supercomputers <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This move, though, comes with a host of challenges that need to be overcome both for near term and long term computing goals.</s>
          <s>One of the greatest is the fabrication of stable, controllable, and scalable qubit arrays.</s>
          <s>There are a myriad of candidate systems to realize qubits-the fundamental building block of quantum computers-each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages to understand, improve, and control their operation <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Electrons confined in semiconductor nanostructures, called quantum dots (QDs), are one such candidate.</s>
          <s>Quantum dots are defined by electrostatically confining electrons in nanowires or in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) present at the interface of semiconductor heterostructures <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In practice, for the linear dot arrays in a 2DEG, the electron density islands are generated in one-dimensional (1D) channels patterned in the 2DEG <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> thus allowing such channels to be modelled as effective nanowires, with electron transport restricted to 1D.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For semiconductor-based methods, the realization of good qubit performance is achieved via electrostatic confinement, band-gap engineering, and dynamically adjusted voltages on nearby electrical gates.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1A shows</ref> a generic setup of quantum dots in a nanowire.</s>
          <s>The voltages applied to barrier gates (V Bi , i = 1, 2, 3) and plunger gates (V Pj , j = 1, 2) define the potential landscape in which the quantum dots are formed.</s>
          <s>In particular, barriers define the dot position by locally depleting carriers beneath them, thereby separating the electron density into disjoint regions, while the plungers shift the chemical potential in the dots relative to the chemical potentials of the contacts.</s>
          <s>In other words, the choice of these voltages determines the number of dots, their position, and their coupling, as well as the number of electrons present in each dot.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The translation of requisite dot locations and charges to gate voltages presents a difficult classical control problem.</s>
          <s>Currently, gate voltages are set heuristically in order to reach a stable few electron configuration in experiment.</s>
          <s>However, given the recent progress in the physical construction of larger arrays of quantum dots <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> , it is imperative to have a reliable and scalable method to find a stable, desirable electron configuration in order to initialize a quantum dot array.</s>
          <s>The ultimate goal is to have a fully automated method to find the voltages that yield the right number of dots, electrons, and couplings.</s>
          <s>There have been initial attempts to use computer-supported, algorithmic experimental device control, though these approaches typically still require human input and device-dependent parameters <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have emerged as a "go to" technique for automated classification, giving reliable output when trained on a representative, comprehensive dataset <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A natural next step towards a fully automated tuning of experiments is to combine the computer-supported device control with machine learning techniques to replace the heuristics developed by experimentalists <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A new "auto-tuning" paradigm, where these two approaches are put together, has recently been realized in the context of single and double dot devices <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In their work, Kalantre et al. proposed a closed-loop system of experimental control using a large, labeled simulated dataset, CNN-based learner, and numerical optimization techniques to automatically tune the quantum dot device.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As with all ML techniques, the quality of the training data is essential for successful implementation of the learner.</s>
          <s>In scenarios like quantum dot tuning, the availability of a physical model that can qualitatively mimic experimental output is key to providing large, reliable datasets for training.</s>
          <s>In our case, we developed such a dataset of simulated current, number of charges on each dot, sensor response, and state identifiers, as a function of the gate voltages.</s>
          <s>This dataset was employed to train a neural network and design an auto-tuning protocol that was further evaluated on simulated and experimental data <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, due to the paramount importance of good quality training data, we released our dataset for future machine learning studies via the Midas system at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and at data.gov <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>, are set to a fixed voltage and are used to form islands by confining electron density to certain region.</s>
          <s>Voltage on the plunger gates, V Pj with j = 1, 2 (dark gray), is varied to allow for control of the current flow through the nanowire.</s>
          <s>B) Potential profile along a nanowire for a double dot system with N 1 and N 2 denoting the number of electrons on each dot.</s>
          <s>C) Possible states in the 5-gate device.</s>
          <s>In the short circuit state the potential profile is below the Fermi level, leading to an unintended current flow.</s>
          <s>When the potential profile is above the Fermi level, the current flow is blocked (barrier state).</s>
          <s>By varying the voltage applied to plunger gates in the lower range while keeping the barriers above the Fermi level of the contacts, one can transition between one and two dots.</s>
          <s>Here, we describe the generation and validation of the dataset employed in Ref. <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , along with a bird's-eye view of auto-tuning of quantum dot devices.</s>
          <s>While the physics of the model we use is presented in detail in Appendix A in Ref. <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , we include here a brief overview for completeness and to set the foundations for the charge sensor model.</s>
          <s>We also introduce QFlow lite-a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data.</s>
          <s>This work thus gives the definitive reference for the dataset (which can be found at Ref. <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> ) to enable researchers to use it in their experiments, as well as in the development of new ML approaches and concepts.</s>

          <s>To mimic the transport characteristics of an experimental device, we developed a model for electron transport in gate-defined quantum dots (again, see Appendix A in Ref. <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> for additional information).</s>
          <s>Here we extend it to include also the charge sensor data generation.</s>
          <s>Note that this model is at best a qualitatively correct approach; the general interacting fermionic problem requires a quantum computer to fully solve, though we expect that the quasi-1D nature of these devices enables (a computationally very expensive) classical simulation to do somewhat better than our inexpensive, modified Thomas-Fermi solver.</s>

        <p>

          <s>Over the past few years machine learning has also revolutionized how research and science are being done.</s>

          <s>Bringing machine learning to automate discovery or other processes rather than using a 'brute force' approach has the potential to substantially accelerate scientific progress across many disciplines.</s>
          <s>However, the success of ML algorithms depends on the quality of the training data.</s>
          <s>To enable research on quantum dot tuning automation, we developed a reliable dataset of simulated current and charge sensor response values versus gate voltage.</s>
          <s>Using this training set, we showed that the algorithm can identify the state of the quantum dots in both simulation and experiment, and then tune the device to a desired electronic state (see Ref. <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> for details about tuning and working with experimental data).</s>
          <s>This establishes a closed-loop system for tuning devices and eliminates the need for human intervention.</s>
          <s>To enable the usage and further study of ML for quantum dot devices, the training dataset is available via the Midas system at NIST and at data.gov <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
        </p>

            <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Progress in quantum dots array sizes has been steady.</s>
          <s>Given that double and triple dots are being routinely used in experiments <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref> and moderate linear array sizes (* 10 dots) <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , as well as two-dimensional arrays <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , are on the horizon, an auto-tuning procedure for these devices is a significant step for employing them in both the laboratories and in applications.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While we focused on double dot devices, the procedure generalizes to higher dimensional systems and, hence, to tuning larger quantum dot arrays.</s>
          <s>We are currently working on a full version of the QFlow suite that will allow the user to choose the type of data to work with (i.e., the current or charge sensor measurements) as well as to automatically tune the device to a desired state.</s>
          <s>In the future, we intend to expand our approach to systems with a larger number of dots in both one as well as two dimensions.</s>
          <s>This should enable ML approaches to take over device control as experiments go from the routine few to the challenging many.</s>
          <s>The fruitful exchange between modern machine learning techniques and quantum technology thus presents an exciting and promising pathway for realizing scalable quantum dot devices for computing and other applications.</s>

        <figDesc>Fig 1. Quantum dots from a nanowire. A) A generic model of a nanowire with 5 gates. The barrier gates, V Bi with i = 1, 2, 3 (light gray), are set to a fixed voltage and are used to form islands by confining electron density to certain region. Voltage on the plunger gates, V Pj with j = 1, 2 (dark gray), is varied to allow for control of the current flow through the nanowire. B) Potential profile along a nanowire for a double dot system with N 1 and N 2 denoting the number of electrons on each dot. C) Possible states in the 5-gate device. In the short circuit state the potential profile is below the Fermi level, leading to an unintended current flow. When the potential profile is above the Fermi level, the current flow is blocked (barrier state). By varying the voltage applied to plunger gates in the lower range while keeping the barriers above the Fermi level of the contacts, one can transition between one and two dots.</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Fig 2. Data simulation flow chart. The simulation for a device begins by setting gate voltages and calculating the potential profile V(x). This potential profile, along with other physical parameters, is used to calculate the electron-density self-consistently along the 1D channel. The state of the channel, e.g., the number of dots is known at this stage. The electron density is used to construct a capacitance model. The model predicts the stable charge states on the dots and the current through the device. The sensor conductance is calculated using the charge states. The final output for a single set of gate voltages consists of the device state (state labels), current, charges, and sensor conductance(s). The simulation is repeated for every point in the space of plunger gate voltages for a single device and then across an ensemble of device geometries.</figDesc>
