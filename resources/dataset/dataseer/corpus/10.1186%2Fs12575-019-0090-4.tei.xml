            <s>Long-term organotypic culture of adult tissues not only open up possibilities for studying complex structures of explants in vitro, but also can be employed e.g. to investigate pathological changes, their fingerprints on tissue mechanics, as well as the effectiveness of drugs.</s>
            <s>While conventional culture methods do not allow for survival times of more than a few days, we have demonstrated recently that TiO 2 nanotube arrays allow to maintain integrity of numerous tissues, including retina, brain, spline and tonsils, for as long as 2 weeks in vitro.</s>
            <s>A mystery in culturing has been the interaction of tissue with these substrates, which is also reflected by tissue debris after liftoff.</s>
            <s>As the latter reveals fingerprints of tissue adhesion and impedes with nanotube array reuse, we address within the present environmental scanning electron study debris nature and the effectiveness of cleaning approaches of distinct physical and chemical methods, including UV-light irradiation, O2 plasma treatment and application of an enzyme-based buffer.</s>
            <s>This will lays the foundation for large-scale regeneration and reuse of nanotube arrays in science and clinical research.</s>

            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While TiO 2 nanotube arrays, that have been synthesized via electrochemical anodization, have been found suitable for cell culturing and stem cell differentiation <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , our work is focused on long-term organotypic cultivation of adult tissue <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref> , as demonstrated by developing scaffolds with highly optimized nanotube geometries for retina <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , brain (neocortex, hippocampus), spleen and tonsils <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Due to their mechanical stability and morphological adjustability, they have been found particularly useful for biomechanical tissue assessments <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , filling the gap between standard cell culture and in vivo studies <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, surface morphology and roughness as well as physical properties like surface charges and surface free energy <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> have critical influences on cell or tissue adhesion to the substrate and serve as important conditions for integrity and preservation of tissue architecture, cell adhesion and motility <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>

          <s>However, despite that TiO 2 nanotubes are used as a tool for cleaning, e.g. the separation of oily substances from water or as photocatalytic active membrane, little is known about cleaning TiO 2 nanotubes themselves from biological residues for reuse, after employing them as culture substrates <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18,</ref>

          <s>In a first step we employed mouse fibroblasts (cell line L929) that were cultured for 7 days on specifically tuned nanotube arrays tube diameter (32 Â± 3) nm) as model system to address within an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) study cell adherence, lift-off and nanotube regeneration.</s>
          <s>In fact, the L929 cell line is widely used and due to their easy handling we can ensure almost identical nanotube-cell-samples for investigations of different nanotube regeneration approaches in a well-controllable and reproducible manner.</s>
          <s>Integrity of cells on top of the nanotube arrays was characterized using the ESEM and compared to cells in culture dishes as reference (not shown here).</s>
          <s>Both culture substrates have the same growth area of 1cm 2 .</s>
          <s>After 1, 4 and 7 days, nanotube samples were imaged with the ESEM, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> .</s>
          <s>Within 24 h, cells are well stretched, not rounded up and adhered well to the nanotube array, as can be concluded from formation of lamellipodia.</s>
          <s>After 4 days in culture, cells arrange in groups and form an aggregate which makes it difficult to distinguish individual cells from each other.</s>
          <s>With increasing density, cells lose their stretched shape and become more spherical, overlap and grow over each other.</s>
          <s>On top of nanotube substrates they reach confluency after 7 days indicating a doubling time of 38 h.</s>
          <s>Compared to cells grown in standard culture wells which show a doubling time of 22 h, L929 cells grow significantly slower on nanostructured surfaces.</s>
          <s>As soon as characterization using ESEM was finished, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 24 h and dried overnight in a vacuum-assisted furnace.</s>

          <s>While conventional culture methods failed to maintain tissue integrity, nanotube arrays can be tuned for different cell and tissue types to enable long-term organotypic culture of adult tissues <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Until now, however, it has not been unveiled how tissue interacts with the surface of nanotube arrays and, in particular, how adhesion is mediated.</s>
          <s>Residuals after tissue lift-off and their removal from the surface of the nanotube arrays reveal a fingerprint of adhesion.</s>
          <s>Vice versa, from a practical point of view, residual removal opens up the possibility of nanotube regeneration and reuse after tissue culture.</s>
          <s>For that purpose we synthesized nanotubes with a diameter of d = (72 Â± 3) nm which are proven suitable for long-term culture of adult guinea pig retinal tissue <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast to previous studies, however, we presently employed retina explants from pig eyes provided by a slaughterhouse.</s>
          <s>This novel approach is motivated by their larger similarity to human eyes due to vascularization of retinal tissue and presence of macula, when compared to commonly studied rabbit or guinea pig eyes.</s>
          <s>In fact, by demonstrating successful organotypic culture of porcine retina explants from slaughterhouse animals on reusable nanotube <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> ESEM images of L929 mouse fibroblast cultured on top of customized nanotube arrays with a tube diameter of (32 Â± 3) nm for different cultivation times: 1 day (a), 4 days (b) and 7 days (c).</s>

          <s>Medium was filled up so that it came into contact with underside of nanotube array but did not cover the top of them.</s>
          <s>Due to super-hydrophilicity of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, medium flows from bottom to top over edge of the nanotube array, ensuring a thin medium wetting layer on top and enables at the same time free gas exchange with the environment, as visualized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> .</s>

          <s>While the cell layer in the periphery was not completely closed, it was purposely chosen as it makes it easier to find the same position during imaging for direct qualification of cleaning progress during UV light treatment.</s>
          <s>After cultivation, samples were imaged with ESEM to check residues (top <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref> ), PFA-fixed and dried in a furnace overnight.</s>
          <s>Afterwards samples were placed inside of the UV-light irradiation chamber and irradiated for overall t = 102 min with a wavelength of Î» = 172 nm.</s>
          <s>To visualize cleaning progress by UV-light exposure, we used one sample for imaging at different stages of UV-light cleaning.</s>
          <s>First, untreated and living cells were imaged (before PFA-fixation) in ESEM-mode serving as control for cell density and integrity <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 4a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Right after that, the samples were PFA-fixed, dried overnight and imaged in high-vacuum-mode after different UV-light exposure times at the same position for 0 min, 2 min, 22 min, 62 min and 102 min, as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref> -f, respectively.</s>

          <s>In our study, L929 cell line and retinal tissue (originally isolated from pigs) were cultured on top of TiO 2 nanotube arrays for the first time and investigated using environmental scanning electron microscopy with regard to their cleaning characteristics by using UV-light and O 2 -plasma exposure, as well as enzymatic treatment.</s>
          <s>We identified significant differences for both cleaning methods and cultivated biological material.</s>
          <s>To ensure cell and tissue survival, free and single standing nanotubes with a tube diameter of (32 Â± 3) nm and (72 Â± 3) nm were used for single cell cultivation <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> and retinal tissue cultivation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , respectively.</s>

          <s>For the L929 cell line, we investigated adhesion and doubling time for reasons of proliferation and to ensure that cells are able to form a continuous and closed layer serving as simplified model of tissue at which cleaning methods can be tested.</s>
          <s>We found good cell adhesion to arrays within 24 h and a smaller doubling time as compared to cells grown in culture dishes which is due to the improved adhesion on nanotube substrates.</s>
          <s>A homogenous and closed cell layer was observed after 7 days in culture.</s>
          <s>For tissue cultivation we checked adhesion as well, by cultivating retina for more than 7 days, removing it from the nanostructures surface and investigating the remaining residues using ESEM.</s>
          <s>Just like for single cell culture, we found good adhesion after 24 h and a continuous adhesion border for tissue to substrate.</s>

          <s>As even after treatment for 24 h with trypsin/EDTA at humid atmosphere no or only little cleaning effects were observable, we conclude that a simple trypsin treatment was not sufficient for cleaning the nanotubes.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, recent studies show that adhesion to underlying substrate is important for a successfully tissue culture and our novel biotechnological concept of TiO 2 nanotube arrays offer that possibility.</s>
          <s>We demonstrate how to clean such arrays for a further usage as cultivation substrate.</s>
          <s>In summary, we found that the cleaning method of choice is determined by the cultured biological material.</s>
          <s>For classical cell culture, UV-light irradiation is sufficient to clean the whole nanotube surface, whereas for tissue cultivation on top of nanostructured arrays a proteinase-K-based lysis buffer has to be used.</s>
          <s>Thus, it is possible to reuse customized TiO 2 nanotube arrays for several cultures for saving resources and work economically.</s>

          <s>Cut and cleaned titanium foil served as anode and a platinum-mesh as cathode.</s>
          <s>Both electrodes were fixed with a constant distance of 45 mm.</s>
          <s>Titanium-foil was chemically etched by immersing both electrodes into electrolyte (consisting of 98% ethylene glycol, 2% distilled water and 0.3% ammonium fluoride powder) and anodized for 60 min.</s>

          <s>An anodization voltage of 16 V was used leading to nanotubes with a diameter of d = (32 Â± 3) nm, which were suitable for single cell culturing <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Each anodized TiO 2 nanotube array was cleaned with ethylene glycole, gently dried with nitrogen stream and afterwards in furnace at 42Â°C overnight.</s>
          <s>To complete nanotube production and to make them usable for single cell culturing, a final cleaning step was performed in an ultrasonic bath with distilled water for 10Â°min to ensure a complete removal of all electrolyte residues.</s>
