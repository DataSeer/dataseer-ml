            <s>Background: Unhealthy food marketing is considered a contributor to childhood obesity.</s>
            <s>In Canada, food marketing in schools is mostly self-regulated by industry though it is sometimes restricted through provincial school policies.</s>
            <s>The purpose of this study was to document the type of food marketing activities occurring in Canadian schools and examine differences by school characteristics.</s>
            <s>Methods: An online survey was sent to public primary and secondary schools from 27 school boards in Ontario, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia and was completed by 154 Principals in spring 2016.</s>
            <s>This survey queried the type of food marketing occurring in schools including advertisements, food product displays, fundraising, exclusive marketing agreements, and incentive programs, among others.</s>
            <s>The occurrence of food marketing was described using frequencies, medians, and ranges.</s>
            <s>Chi-square and Fisher Exact tests were conducted to assess school-level differences in the frequency of marketing activities by school type (primary versus secondary), province (Ontario versus British Columbia), and the socio-economic status of most students (low versus middle/high income).</s>
            <s>The significance level was set at α &lt; 0.05 for all tests.</s>
            <s>Results: Overall, 84% of schools reported at least one type of food marketing and the median number of distinct types of marketing per school was 1 (range 0-6).</s>
            <s>The most frequently reported forms of marketing were the sale of branded food, particularly chocolate, pizza, and other fast food, for fundraising (64% of schools); food advertisements on school property (26%), and participation in incentive programs (18%).</s>
            <s>Primary schools (n = 108) were more likely to report participating in incentive programs (25%) and selling branded food items (72%) compared to secondary schools (n = 46; 2 and 43% respectively; p &lt; 0.01).</s>
            <s>Conversely, secondary schools were more likely to report food advertising on school property (56%), exclusive marketing arrangements with food companies (43%), and food product displays (19%) than primary schools (13, 5 and 2%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01).</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The presence of food marketing in most participating schools suggests that the current patchwork of policies that restrict food marketing in Canadian schools is inadequate.</s>
            <s>Comprehensive restrictions should be mandated by government in both primary and secondary schools to protect children and youth from this marketing.</s>

        <p>
          <s>According to recent estimates, the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents went from 11 to 124 million globally between 1975 and 2016 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Canada, rates of childhood obesity have doubled over the last 30 years <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , and almost one third of children and adolescents aged 5-17 have excess weight or obesity <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The frequency of food and beverage marketing (hereafter referred to as food marketing) directed at children and youth has also increased in tandem with rising obesity rates, not only in traditional media such as television, but also in new media such as the Internet and smartphones and in schools and other places where youth gather <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Food marketing, much of which promotes unhealthy products <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , has been shown to directly impact children's food preferences, food requests, and short-term food intake <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, food marketing has been associated with childhood obesity <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , a risk factor in the development of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Marketing is defined as "any form of commercial communication or message that is designed to, or has the effect of, increasing the recognition, appeal and/or consumption of particular products and services."</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> It includes any activity that "acts to advertise or otherwise promote a product or service" <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Product, price, place (i.e.</s>
          <s>how products are made accessible to a specific group of consumers) and promotion (i.e.</s>
          <s>persuasive communication approaches such as advertising used to transmit information to consumers) are often cited as the four tools of marketing <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Schools are an attractive setting for food companies interested in influencing children's dietary behaviors.</s>
          <s>They offer an opportunity to advertise (and sell) directly to a captive audience of young people segmented by age, among whom fostered brand loyalty may lead to lifelong consumption of promoted products <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Schools are also "uncluttered marketing environments" <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> in which children spend more than 180 days a year <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This allows for prolonged exposure to food marketing.</s>
          <s>Many different forms of marketing have been identified in schools to date.</s>
          <s>These include: (1) appropriation of space (i.e., using school property to promote companies through naming rights or advertising), (2) corporate sponsorship of programs, events or contests (i.e., corporations paying for or subsidizing activities in return for recognition), (3) exclusive marketing arrangements (i.e., contractual agreements giving companies exclusive rights to sell their products on school property), (4) incentive programs (i.e., programs that provide a commercial reward in return for student achievement), (5) sponsored educational materials (i.e., curricular materials provided to schools by corporate companies), (6) electronic marketing (i.e., the use of television, Internet or other media to promote brands) and (7) fundraising (i.e., direct sales of services or products of which a portion of the revenues are given to schools to raise money) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>

          <s>According to a national survey on commercialism in Canadian primary and secondary schools conducted in 2004-05, 27% of schools overall had an exclusive marketing agreement with two large beverage companies, and in-school advertisements for both companies were the most predominant compared to other companies <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>More recently, Velazquez et al. <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> documented considerable presence of promotional materials for unhealthy foods and beverages in schools in Vancouver, British Columbia despite school board policies that prohibit such advertising.</s>

            <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[25]</ref> ; however, none include comprehensive restrictions of food marketing according to an analysis of publicly available school policy documents (Chambers S and Potvin <ref type="bibr">Kent M, unpublished)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This was also found to be the case for most public school boards in British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova-Scotia (Chambers S and Potvin <ref type="bibr">Kent M, unpublished)</ref> .</s>

          <s>Of the 18 companies currently participating, eleven have pledged to refrain from marketing food or beverage products directly to children under 12 years, while the remaining companies have pledged to only advertise "healthier" products to this age group <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Each company has defined what constitutes marketing to children, and uniform nutrition criteria defining which products can be advertised to children have been in effect since December 2015 <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Regarding the primary school setting, CAI participants are required "to adhere to standards established by schools (…) and by school boards" and must "commit to not advertise food and beverage products in schools" with noted exceptions including charitable activities (e.g., fundraising and educational programs), public service messaging, and food product displays <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In fall 2015, contact information for all public school boards in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia) was accessed through the Canadian Schools Database Directory <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[27]</ref> and approval to conduct research was sought from 217 school boards in these provinces.</s>
          <s>These provinces were selected because we wanted to obtain information from schools where support and implementation of food-related initiatives was varied, and because they constituted the most populous provinces in western, central, and eastern Canada <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ontario and British Columbia have 13.4 and 4.6 million inhabitants, respectively, while Nova-Scotia has a population of 923,000 <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In total, 27 school boards agreed to participate; 13 from British Columbia, 12 from Ontario, and 2 from Nova-Scotia.</s>
          <s>No school boards from Quebec agreed to participate.</s>
          <s>Their refusal may be attributable to the fact that Quebec has had provincial legislation banning commercial advertising to children since the 1980s <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>School boards may have considered the study to be non-pertinent given the policy context.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Administrators (e.g., Principals, Vice-Principals) of schools where board approval was granted were sent an email containing a cover letter explaining the goals of the study and a link to complete a web-based, cross-sectional survey in spring 2016.</s>
          <s>This survey was available in both official languages of Canada (i.e.</s>
          <s>English and French).</s>
          <s>Although this was the methodology followed for the majority of school boards, eleven school boards did not permit direct communication with school Principals.</s>
          <s>In these cases, surveys were sent directly to Principals from their respective school board.</s>
          <s>Principals were sent a reminder email approximately two weeks after initial contact was made and again one week after the first reminder was sent.</s>
          <s>The survey was closed one week after the third and final reminder was received.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Overall, food marketing was prevalent among our sample of Canadian schools with most Principals (84%) reporting the presence of one or more types of food marketing within their school.</s>
          <s>Two-thirds of participating schools reported selling branded food items, particularly pizza, chocolate, and other fast food, for fundraising purposes.</s>
          <s>A quarter of schools reported food advertisements on school property, which were most often found on vending machines, and about 1 in 6 schools reported participating in rewards programs, having exclusive marketing arrangements with food companies or receiving financial contributions in return for publicity.</s>
          <s>Our findings suggest that while present, school-based food marketing seems less pervasive in Canada compared to the United States.</s>
          <s>In US schools, exclusive marketing agreements, reward and incentive programs, and the distribution of free items such as coupons have been found to be particularly widespread <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For instance, national surveys have found that 63% of high school students in the United States attend schools with exclusive marketing agreements <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[33]</ref> and 64% of primary school students attend schools where food coupons are distributed as incentives <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Advertising, especially on posters and signs, vending machines, food and beverage display cases, and in school media (e.g., yearbooks), has also been found to be pervasive in some US school districts <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These types of food marketing were reported considerably less frequently in our sample.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our results also differed from the few Canadian studies that have documented school-based food marketing.</s>
          <s>For instance, Velazquez et al. <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> documented food promotions and advertisements in 100% of secondary schools and 80% of primary schools surveyed in Vancouver while only 25% of schools overall reported such advertising in our study.</s>
          <s>This difference may in part be attributable to the fact that advertisements were self-reported in our study whereas the promotions in Vancouver schools were identified through direct observation.</s>
          <s>Thus, it is conceivable that the frequency of food advertising on school property reported in our study is underestimated.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The prevalence of exclusive marketing agreements with food companies was also lower in our study (16%) compared to what has been previously reported in Canada.</s>
          <s>A national survey on commercialism in Canadian schools conducted in 2004-05 found that 27% of schools had an exclusive marketing arrangement with two large beverage companies <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may suggest a decline in exclusive marketing agreements within schools.</s>
          <s>Such a decline could be explained by the introduction of policies restricting the sale of certain unhealthy food items, such as regular soft drinks, in many Canadian provinces <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>

          <s>For instance, participation in reward or incentive programs was almost solely reported by primary schools, whereas exclusive marketing agreements and food product displays were more prevalent in secondary schools.</s>
          <s>These results are consistent with studies conducted in Canada, where marketing has been found to differ by school type <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14,</ref>

          <s>For example, Velazquez et al. <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> found that food promotions were more prevalent overall in secondary schools than primary schools.</s>

          <s>Similarly, in the United States, vending of branded food and beverages and exclusive marketing agreements have been found to be more common in secondary than primary schools <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As Terry McElrath et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> suggest, these different marketing approaches are likely tailored to the way younger children and adolescents exercise their purchasing power.</s>

          <s>‡ Chi-square test result is unreliable as one or more cells have an expected value lower than 5 schools because they incentivise purchases made by parents, while exclusive marketing agreements and food displays (indicative of more food vending) are more frequent in secondary schools because adolescents have access to more money and can make direct purchases independently.</s>

          <s>According to our only significant finding, schools where the majority of students were of lower socio-economic status were more likely to report the distribution of free branded items than schools where most students were of higher socio-economic status.</s>
          <s>It is possible that schools located in poorer neighbourhoods distribute more branded foods through their school nutrition/ breakfast programs.</s>
          <s>Despite asking respondents what type of free items were distributed in their school, the quality of our data did not allow us to explore this question further.</s>

            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">37]</ref> , suggest that unhealthy products are being promoted by way of fundraising.</s>
          <s>For instance, 95% of schools selling branded food items to raise funds reported selling either chocolate, pizza, and/or other fast-food items.</s>

            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">39]</ref> , it also highlights the lack of enforcement of these policies.</s>
          <s>For example, 44% of Principals from British Columbia reported that chocolate was sold for fundraising, despite it being prohibited by the province's guidelines on the sale of food and beverages in schools <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The sale of unhealthy foods within schools raises health concerns because it promotes unhealthy dietary behaviors among Canadian children and youth whose diets often exceed the daily recommended intake for sodium and sugar and are inadequate in fruit and vegetables <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[40]</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[41]</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the promotion of foods inconsistent with the tenets of healthy eating taught in schools creates contradictory messages and conflicts with schools' mission to educate and promote student well-being <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>That said, even if a branded food item (e.g., pizza from a large chain restaurant) is compliant with school nutrition standards, it is debatable as to whether the sale of this item should be permitted, particularly if children are exposed to a brand that is largely associated with unhealthy products, as is the case for most fast-food and dine-in restaurants in Canada <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The potential for such contradictory messages should be considered when crafting food marketing restrictions in schools.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Although most Principals (&gt; 75%) agreed with statements acknowledging the detrimental effect of food marketing on children's dietary behaviors and health, it is worth noting that nearly half of all Principals sampled either agreed or expressed a neutral position with a statement affirming that the exposure of children to food marketing is an acceptable trade-off for funds or resources that may otherwise not be available.</s>
          <s>The need for resources may indeed be a key factor driving school-based food marketing and may be breeding ambivalence among administrators regarding the issue.</s>
          <s>Addressing budget shortfalls and supporting schools to find alternative funding sources will likely be required to gain the support needed to adopt and implement more comprehensive measures restricting food marketing within schools.</s>
          <s>In fact, economic constraints including the cost of policy-compliant (i.e., healthy) foods, lack of infrastructure (e.g., kitchen) and human resources, coupled with the reliance on food sales to ensure the viability of school cafeterias have all been cited as impediments to the implementation of school nutrition policies in Canada <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[46]</ref>

          <s>In addition to its limited scope, the voluntary nature of this initiative also means that it does not apply to several companies or industry associations such as fast food restaurant chains selling pizza or sandwiches and national or provincial dairy associations among others, that have been identified as carrying out marketing (mostly fundraising) in our sample of schools.</s>

          <s>Regardless, given the presence of food marketing in most schools, our results suggest that the current patchwork of policies has not been effective at protecting children from food marketing in schools.</s>

          <s>In addition, the small sample of schools included here did not permit school type or socio-economic status sub-analyses by provinces which constitute different policy environments.</s>
