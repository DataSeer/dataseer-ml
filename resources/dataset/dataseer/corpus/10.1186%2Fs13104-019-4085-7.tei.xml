        <p>
          <s>This study revealed that 85.97% were willing to pay for HPV service.</s>
          <s>The result was line with studies done in Arba Minch town in 2011 on willingness to pay for insecticide treated bed net (86%) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other side, this study showed that willing to pay health professionals for HPV were higher than willing to pay for injectable contraceptive and foot wear for podoconiosis which were (68%) and (72.8%) respectively, in studies done in Tigray and northern Ethiopia <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may be due to study population difference which may not have equal information about health.</s>
          <s>However, the result of the study was lower than willingness of respondents to pay for health service in Iran which was 88.8% <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The possible reason might be difference in study areas, cultural and demographic and study population differences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The average amount of money, the respondents willing to pay for HPV, was 231.34ETB (US$8.51)</s>
          <s>which was greater than the price used to elicit preference by 31ETB.</s>
          <s>The amount of money respondents were willing to pay for HPV was much higher than the amount of money respondents were willing to pay for injectable contraceptive per service and footwear for podoconiosis per year which were 11 Birr (US$0.65)</s>

          <s>The possible explanation for this may be study population difference, the currency inflation and program differences.</s>
          <s>But the result of the study was lower than a study done on willingness to pay for HPV vaccine which was US$ 11.68 in Nigeria <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> and US$ 50.26 in Malaysia <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> , and WTP for the clinical preventive services which was US$93.72 in South-Nigeria <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may be due to the difference in socioeconomic difference of the participants like per capita income, study population difference.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The age of respondents had negatively associated with willingness to pay.</s>
          <s>The negative association may be as age respondents' increase, they may have less family income due to large family than younger age groups might be the possible explanations.</s>
          <s>This result was inconsistent with studies done on WTP for Pap test in Nigeria <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> , willingness to pay for health care services in Malaysia <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> and Iran <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> had a positive association with WTP.</s>
          <s>The possible difference might be different per capital income of those countries.</s>
          <s>This result contradicted with studies done on WTP for mortality risk reduction from the environment in USA <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> which reveals age does not have association with WTP for mortality risk reduction.</s>
          <s>One possible explanation for this difference may be all age groups equally risky by environmental risk factors in studies done USA.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study also showed that educational status was identified as significant variable to WTP for HPV.</s>
          <s>Possibly this might be as educational status increases, individuals might have more information and aware about their health issues.</s>
          <s>This report was consistent with studies done Addis Ababa <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , Malaysia <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , Iran <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , Arba Minch <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> which revealed educational status had positive association with the preference and utilization of different health services.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The knowledge of health professionals' about cervical cancer and its risk factors had statistical association with willingness to pay.</s>
          <s>The possible explanation for this might be as individuals know more about cervical cancer and its risk factors, they become more willing to prevent cervical cancer.</s>

          <s>Another limitation of this study was respondents' bias that aims to reduce the cost of payment to the service and those have family history of cervical cancer need HPV vaccination might overestimate the cost.</s>
