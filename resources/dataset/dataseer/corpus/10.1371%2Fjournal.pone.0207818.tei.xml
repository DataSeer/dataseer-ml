          <s>Smoking among women of reproductive age (ages is of particular concern due to adverse impacts on mother and infant health should these women become pregnant, as well as the risks of second-hand smoke exposure should they be parenting young children <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>

          <s>We know of no reports comparing smoking among rural versus urban women of reproductive age.</s>
          <s>A conference presentation by investigators from the American Lung Association reviewed prevalence data among pregnant and nonpregnant women of reproductive age using the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) noting that (a) overall crude smoking rates were greater among rural than urban women and (b) while pregnant urban women smoked less than their non-pregnant counterparts, there was no significant difference between rural pregnant compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that there was less pregnancy-related quitting among rural versus urban women <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence, the overarching purpose of the present study was to examine rural versus urban differences in smoking prevalence among women of reproductive age and whether rural women may be more likely to continue smoking during pregnancy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We are unaware of any prior reports on whether prevalence of nicotine dependence differs between rural versus urban smokers, but of course nicotine dependence is a major contributor to the emergence and persistence of chronic smoking <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> and is a robust predictor of difficulties in quitting cigarette smoking in clinical samples and self-quitters <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, comparing prevalence of nicotine dependence between rural versus urban women of reproductive age who smoke was a secondary aim of the present study.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Rural women, including pregnant women, lag behind their urban counterparts in reducing smoking prevalence, exhibit greater nicotine dependence, and what appears to be lower odds of quitting smoking during pregnancy, disparities that have potential for direct, multi-generational adverse health impacts.</s>
          <s>These findings highlight the need for more effective national and local tobacco control and regulatory efforts to reduce smoking among rural women of reproductive age.</s>
