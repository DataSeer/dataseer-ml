        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>In the United States, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality with 234,000 new cases and 154,000 deaths from this disease expected in 2018 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Of these new cases, approximately 85% will be non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> which is most commonly diagnosed after distant metastasis has already occurred <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, the 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with stage IV NSCLC from 2007 to 2013 was just 5.2% <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been significant interest in the application of new treatment modalities and therapeutic combinations to improve prognosis for this group of patients, including the use of immunotherapy <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> and consolidative radiotherapy (RT) for select oligometastatic cases <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis was approved for metastatic NSCLC based on the groundbreaking CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057 trials <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since that time, the indications for immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC have expanded to include first-line therapy for patients with metastatic disease and tumor PD-L1 expression ≥50% <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, an OS benefit for all PD-L1 categories receiving pembrolizumab plus cytotoxic chemotherapy compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone has been observed in the setting of metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, patients with any history of predominantly intracranial (61%) RT receiving pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC had improved OS in a secondary analysis of the phase I KEYNOTE-001 trial <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These data combined with promising preclinical observations <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> and the theoretical advantages of combined radioimmunotherapy <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> have promoted enthusiasm for concurrent or sequential RT plus immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we hypothesized that RT plus immunotherapy would associate with improved OS for patients with stage IV NSCLC in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and further examined the influence of RT technique and dose on OS.</s>

          <s>Specifically, our finding that patients receiving SRT experienced improved OS should be considered alongside the previously reported high progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.7 months and median OS of 20.4 months in a single-arm, phase II protocol of SRT with concurrent erlotinib for patients with stage IV NSCLC involving ≤6 sites after progression through first-or subsequent-line chemotherapy <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, compared to an expected median OS of just 11 months for stage IV NSCLC treated with a first-line platinum doublet <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , the median OS of 14.3 months for SRT + chemotherapy and 18.2 months for SRT + immunotherapy as observed in our report are quite promising.</s>
          <s>Although analyses investigating differences in OS based on the existence of oligometastatic versus polymetastatic disease are not possible using the NCDB, Gomez et al. have previously reported a high median PFS of 11.9 months after local consolidative therapy including SRT for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC involving ≤3 sites that had not progressed after first-line chemotherapy <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This again suggests that select patients with metastatic NSCLC may be appropriate candidates for an aggressive treatment paradigm incorporating local ablative therapy.</s>

            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This observation in the laboratory was bolstered by a secondary analysis of the KEYNOTE-001 phase I trial wherein patients with advanced NSCLC receiving any prior RT (61% intracranial) followed by pembrolizumab had a significantly higher median OS of 10.7 months vs. 5.3 months for those receiving pembrolizumab without previous RT <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These data are encouraging when viewed as a foundation to support the use of RT as a strategy to induce response to immune checkpoint blockade for patients with metastatic NSCLC as the unselected overall response rate with single agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is only 17-19% <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This possibility is further suggested by the results of a randomized phase II study of SRT and sequential pembrolizumab vs. pembrolizumab alone for patients with advanced NSCLC with the experimental arm having an overall response rate of 41% and a median PFS of 6.4 months compared to 19% and 1.8 months, respectively, for the control arm <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our observed significantly prolonged median OS of 18.2 months for combined SRT and immunotherapy in the NCDB is consistent with these previously published data; however, evidence of a synergistic interaction between SRT and immunotherapy did not reach significance.</s>
          <s>RT dose and fractionation may influence the complex relationship between RT-induced immunomodulation and anti-tumor response <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>

            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This shift towards higher RT doses per fraction for select patients with stage IV NSCLC has been supported by mouse models wherein higher RT doses in fewer fractions were associated with increased tumor CD8+ T-cell infiltration <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although these preclinical data are somewhat inconsistent with the results of Shaverdian et al.'s secondary analysis of KEYNOTE-001 showing improved oncologic outcomes for predominantly non-SRT radiation (n = 49/70, 70%) followed by pembrolizumab, they offer a potential mechanistic explanation for several observations in our data including (1) reduced OS for EBRT +immunotherapy, (2) an impressive median OS of 32.1 months for high-BED SRT + immunotherapy, and (3) a significant interaction for BED and systemic therapy among patients receiving SRT.</s>
          <s>Of note, it is possible that the relative influence of dose and fractionation on the biological interactions between RT and immunotherapy may differ as a function of treatment setting since conventionally fractionated EBRT followed by durvalumab has been associated with improved OS for patients with locally advanced rather than metastatic NSCLC <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Limitations to this study include the lack of information on biomarkers including PD-L1 status, possibility for coding errors in NCDB data, the inability to examine alternative endpoints of interest including toxicity or PFS, heterogeneity of agents coded as immunotherapy in the NCDB, and selection bias regarding treatment received.</s>
          <s>It is likely that patient selection factors influenced some associations between aggressive local therapy and improved OS as patients with a lower disease burden including oligometastases may have preferentially received SRT and/or higher-BED SRT regimens.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the inclusion of patients receiving heterogeneous RT doses within the EBRT subset may limit generalizations for this group.</s>
          <s>Despite these caveats, our data demonstrate that SRT associates with improved OS for patients with stage IV NSCLC in the NCDB regardless of systemic treatment.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Overall, the hypothesis-generating observation of superior OS for patients receiving high-BED SRT and immunotherapy, the reduction in OS for patients receiving EBRT and immunotherapy, and the significant interaction between BED and systemic therapy suggest that RT technique may influence the efficacy of immunotherapy in this setting.</s>
          <s>These findings strongly support efforts to evaluate optimal multimodality radiation and immunotherapy strategies in prospective randomized trials.</s>
