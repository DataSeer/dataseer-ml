        <p>
          <s>Akha and Lahu youths are vulnerable to alcohol use, with a prevalence of alcohol users of 45.0%.</s>
          <s>Males had a greater proportion of alcohol users than females, but no difference was found between tribes.</s>
          <s>The majority initiated their alcohol use between 15 and 19 years of age with beer.</s>
          <s>The major reason that they initiated alcohol consumption was persuasion from their peers and curiosity.</s>
          <s>A large proportion was classified as regular drinkers, and some individuals used drugs while drinking alcohol.</s>
          <s>One-fifth had suffered an accident or injury after drinking alcohol, and some had experienced unsafe sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner and had been in an argument.</s>
          <s>Several factors were associated with the initiation of alcohol use among Akha and Lahu youths, including religion, occupation, parents' occupations, parents' alcohol use behaviors, and the number of their peers who used alcohol.</s>
          <s>This study had a few limitations.</s>
          <s>One participant could not identify their age; because no other evidence could be used for identification, he was excluded from the study.</s>
          <s>Recall bias is always a significant factor in a cross-sectional study.</s>
          <s>However, alcohol use behavior is a common occurrence in individuals, and the answers to questions regarding frequent behaviors do not tend to deviate from the truth.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In our study, we found that the prevalence of alcohol use among the Akha and Lahu youths was very high (45.0%)</s>
          <s>compared to the average for Thai youths, which was reported to be 27.9% in 2015 <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The prevalence in this study was also higher than the prevalence of alcohol use among youths living in northern Thailand, which was reported to be 28.3% in 2017 <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>No significant difference in the prevalence was found between the Akha and Lahu youths.</s>
          <s>This result coincides with that of the study of Banks et al. among American adolescents aged 12-18 years in 2017, which found no difference in expectancies and consumption among different races <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Cigarettes are the major drug used while drinking alcohol among the Akha and Lahu youths, particularly by males.</s>
          <s>This result is similar to that of the report of Karl et al. among <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">65,</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">528</ref> Korean students in 2016, which found that 13.3% were concurrent lifetime smokers and drinkers, with males having a greater proportion than females <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Karl et al. also reported that factors such as male sex, higher education, lower paternal and maternal education levels, lower socioeconomic status, and living in rural areas were associated with alcohol use <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A study in California among youths regarding simultaneous alcohol and marijuana use found that contexts with no other underage drinkers were associated with a 99.0% lower risk of simultaneous use <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, the data analysis from the 2011-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health in the United States with a total of 14,667 participants found that for the majority of alcohol users among youths, females reported using only alcohol, whereas males were more likely to be concurrent alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette users <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[44]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this study, we found that the earliest age of initiation of alcohol use was 12 years old among the Akha and Lahu youths.</s>
          <s>This age is less than that of a study in Slovakia that found that the initiation age of alcohol use among the Slovakian youths was ≤13 years old and that males had a greater proportion of alcohol users than females <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, use of alcohol from an earlier age tends to have consequences.</s>
          <s>Doran et al. reported that the onset of first alcohol use was strongly predictive of earlier sexual intercourse for both males and females, with the effects of drinking most pronounced for females during early adolescence <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[46]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, Donoghue et al. found that an age at first alcohol use younger than 15 years was associated with cigarette use, a lower quality of life, alcohol-related health and social consequences, and evidence of an alcohol use disorder among youth populations in England <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[47]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We also found that the Akha and Lahu youths favored beer and local whisky and that the initiating beverage for most of them was beer.</s>
          <s>Males preferred drinking local whisky over other beverages.</s>
          <s>Drinking alcohol was symbolic because it showed strong physical health and readiness to be a community leader <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[48]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In terms of the prevalence of alcohol use, we also found that the older age category had a higher prevalence than the younger age categories.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The reasons for alcohol use among the Akha and Lahu youths were persuasion by their peers and curiosity.</s>
          <s>In 2016, a study in Canada among adolescents aged 11-20 years old found a link between the use of social networking sites among youths and alcohol use <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A longitudinal study in Australian youths that examined the association between the density of alcohol outlets and alcohol use among the 2835 youths reported that the participants' perceptions of alcohol availability, alcohol use by friends and a higher alcohol density were associated with alcohol consumption by youths at an early age <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[50]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our study, we found that having friends who used alcohol inside and outside the village was significantly associated with alcohol use in the Akha and Lahu youths.</s>
          <s>The number of close friends who used alcohol had a great impact on the initiation of alcohol use among Akha and Lahu youths.</s>
          <s>This finding coincides with that of the study of Nuria et al., who reported that the main reason for engaging in alcohol use among Spanish youths was enhancing their social relationships, which acted as a mechanism to normalize intensive alcohol consumption <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[51]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Several factors were related to alcohol use among the Akha and Lahu youths in this study, including religion, occupation, parents' occupations, parents' alcohol use behaviors and the number of their peers who used <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[48]</ref> , which may impact the initiation of alcohol use, particularly in males.</s>
          <s>However, several studies have reported that religion played a role as a protective factor against the initiation of alcohol use <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[52,</ref>
            <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">53]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study found that having more close friends led to greater odds of alcohol use among Akha and Lahu youths; in particular, having close friends who used alcohol made the participants more likely to use alcohol.</s>
          <s>In the in-depth interview stage, some youths said that loneliness and stress were a cause of initiation of alcohol use among hill tribe youths.</s>
          <s>Michael conducted a study among UK youths in 2017 and found that being female and experiencing loneliness were linked to greater risks of alcohol use within the past 30 days than the risk for males <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[54]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, a study by Aranza et al. reported that restraint stress significantly increased the rate of alcohol intake and preference in females but decreased alcohol intake and preference in males <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[55]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, in our study, we found that males tended to use alcohol more than females, which might be due to social norms.</s>
          <s>Most hill tribe people have fewer males than females <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[48]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, increased acceptance of male but not female alcohol use was not our expectation.</s>
          <s>Eric et al. reported that perceived injunctive and descriptive norms for male youths were associated with all alcohol drinking outcomes, including past year use, past month frequency, past month quantity, and peak drinking <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This result was supported by a study in China among minorities in Yunnan Province, which is located close to northern Thailand; that study found that living in a drinking environment and particularly having close friends who used alcohol had direct effects on alcohol use <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We found that the Akha and Lahu youths with occupations and those who earned higher incomes had greater odds of engaging in alcohol use than those who were students and those who had no income.</s>
          <s>This result coincides with that of a study conducted in 10 different countries including Thailand that assessed the associations of different characteristics between those who did and did not use alcohol and found that income was significantly associated with alcohol use <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">[58]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Yi et al. also supported the finding that having an income was a significant factor for alcohol use among university students in ASEAN countries <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">[59]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Father's alcohol use behavior and occupation were significantly associated with alcohol use among their children in Akha and Lahu youths.</s>
          <s>He et al. <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[57]</ref> also reported that the father's alcohol use behavior impacted alcohol use by their children.</s>
          <s>A study in the Netherlands supported an association of father's alcohol use as a direct path for alcohol use in their high school-aged children <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[60]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreno et al. <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[61]</ref> also reported that among Hispanics, greater social support from and greater negative interactions with the father figure were more predictive of earlier onset of alcohol use, whereas greater social support from the mother figure was more predictive of a later alcohol onset.</s>
          <s>Even in a study conducted in Thailand, family members' alcohol use, particularly parents' alcohol use, was a significant associated factor for alcohol use in their high school-aged children <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[62]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Thailand has several policies regarding alcohol control and prevention through several mechanisms such as restriction on the hours of sale, raising the minimum age limit of purchase, restricting proximities of alcohol outlets from schools <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[63,</ref>
            <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">64]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Even though Thailand has a good policy and has been implemented for several years to control alcohol, some policies have not successful for its implementation such as failed to control the number of alcohol outlets, increasing tax rates, and compliance to age and time restrictions <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[65]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, these policies are not too much effective implementation in the remote hill tribe villages due to limit of number of government office to monitor regarding the regulations.</s>
