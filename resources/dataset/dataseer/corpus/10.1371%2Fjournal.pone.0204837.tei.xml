            <s>Cooperation is one of the most studied paradigms for the understanding of social interactions.</s>
            <s>Reciprocal altruism -a special type of cooperation that is taught by means of the iterated prisoner dilemma game (iPD)-has been shown to emerge in different species with different success rates.</s>
            <s>When playing iPD against a reciprocal opponent, the larger theoretical long-term reward is delivered when both players cooperate mutually.</s>
            <s>In this work, we trained rats in iPD against an opponent playing a Tit for Tat strategy, using a payoff matrix with positive and negative reinforcements, that is food and timeout respectively.</s>
            <s>We showed for the first time, that experimental rats were able to learn reciprocal altruism with a high average cooperation rate, where the most probable state was mutual cooperation (85%).</s>
            <s>Although when subjects defected, the most probable behavior was to go back to mutual cooperation.</s>
            <s>When we modified the matrix by increasing temptation rewards (T) or by increasing cooperation rewards (R), the cooperation rate decreased.</s>
            <s>In conclusion, we observe that an iPD matrix with large positive reward improves less cooperation than one with small rewards, shown that satisfying the relationship among iPD reinforcement was not enough to achieve high mutual cooperation behavior.</s>
            <s>Therefore, using positive and negative reinforcements and an appropriate contrast between rewards, rats have cognitive capacity to learn reciprocal altruism.</s>
            <s>This finding allows to infer that the learning of reciprocal altruism has early appeared in evolution.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Altruism is a behavior by an individual that may be to his disadvantage but benefits others individuals.</s>
          <s>At first sight, Darwin's natural selection theory does not explain altruistic behavior.</s>
          <s>Theories have been proposed to account altruist behavior: kin selection <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , group selection and reciprocal altruism <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> among others.</s>
          <s>In the reciprocal altruism theory, the loss experienced by an individual for being altruist returns later on behalf of the reciprocal partner.</s>
          <s>Thus, in the long term, being altruist becomes the most useful strategy.</s>
          <s>In this regard, Triver's theory of reciprocal altruism explains how natural selection favors reciprocal altruism between non-related individuals.</s>
          <s>Perhaps the most insightful example of such behavior is the one a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 observed among vampire bats, where individuals share blood with others who have previously shared their food <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since 1971, Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (iPD) has been a useful tool to study reciprocal altruism <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the iPD, two players must choose between two possible behaviors: to cooperate or to defect.</s>
          <s>Rewards and punishments are defined in a 2x2 payoff matrix.</s>
          <s>When the game is played indefinitely, which is its iterated version, mutual cooperative behavior is favored.</s>
          <s>When played once, to defect is the best strategy <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, when the game runs indefinitely, evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) emerge <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> and, under certain constraints imposed to the payoff matrix, mutual cooperation appears as the best strategy whenever reciprocity is maintained (Pareto Optimum).</s>
          <s>Among a huge number of reciprocal strategies, tit for tat is one of the most simple ones <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is based on two simple rules: to cooperate in the first trial and, in the following, to do what the other player (opponent) did in the last trial.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Among many reciprocal behaviors, reciprocity and reciprocal altruism were well documented in several species.</s>
          <s>Although cooperation is needed to succeed in both reciprocity and reciprocal altruism, the latter adds the possibility of obtaining reward by defecting an opponent.</s>
          <s>Some experiments show reciprocal altruism behavior by means of iPD paradigm in different ways, but the results were either low levels of cooperation <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> or depended on a treatment that enhanced cooperation preference (mutualism matrix) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Direct reciprocity, which is established between two individuals, has been observed in monkeys <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> and in rats <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While food quality seemed to impact on cooperative behavior, a key factor to obtain reliable cooperation levels was the opponent's behavior.</s>
          <s>In this sense, individuals tended to be more cooperative with opponents that had cooperated in the past.</s>
          <s>However, when reciprocal altruism is studied, differences between species come to light.</s>
          <s>Thus, while reciprocal altruism has been proven in monkeys, birds and rats failed to reach high levels of cooperation, even for complex combinations of rewards and punishments in the payoff matrix and treatments to induce preference <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>

            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The reasons why some species do not learn reciprocal altruism remain obscure.</s>
          <s>A possible explanation is that animals are not able to discriminate low contrast reward contingencies.</s>
          <s>Indeed, it has been shown that rats fail to discriminate the amount of reward when the number of reward units is larger than three <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this work, we designed an iPD setup to maximize the contrast among reinforcers.</s>
          <s>The amounts of pellets were chosen in order to minimize positive reinforcement earned in each trial and to keep rats motivated (hungry), <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In order to evaluate if animals developed ALLC strategy by place preference (after animals learned iPD) they were trained on reversal.</s>
          <s>We also evaluated reward maximization studying how the payoff matrix components promote or disrupt altruistic behavior.</s>

          <s>Positive reinforcements were pellets (Bio-Serv 45 mg Dustless Precision Pellets) and negative reinforcement was timeout (a fix delay in starting a new trial).</s>
          <s>The payoff of the experimental subject was according to the matrix, and the opponent's payoff was 1 pellet when the correct lighted lever was pressed.</s>
          <s>For the opponent, when the incorrect lever was pressed, there was no contingency and no pellet was delivered.</s>
          <s>The trial finishes after 45 seconds elapsed, or when the correct lever is pressed.</s>
          <s>The iPD game has four possible occupancy states where experimental and opponent individual behaviors can be as follows: both cooperate (mutual cooperation, R), both do not cooperate (mutual defection, P), experimental subject does not cooperate when the opponent cooperates (T), and experimental cooperates when the opponent does not cooperate (S).</s>
          <s>The amount of pellets preference was previously tested on a discrimination test, showing that rats prefer 2 pellets rather than 1 pellet (data not showed).</s>

          <s>The opponent's Conditioned Stimulus (light) was controlled following a Tit for tat strategy.</s>
          <s>The opponent received a pellet after pressing three times the lever (FR = 3, so as to be enough time in front of the window until the experimental subject choose a lever).</s>
          <s>If negative reinforcement (timeout) was assigned, delay time started, and the opponent subject got a pellet reward.</s>
          <s>(5) After either five seconds eating time expired or timeout was completed, a new trial started.</s>
          <s>In the first experiment the payoff matrix was: 1 pellet for mutual cooperation (P R = 1), 2 pellets when the experimental subject defected and the opponent cooperated (P T = 2), 4 seconds of timeout for mutual defection (P P = 4seconds), and 8 seconds of timeout when the experimental subject cooperated and the opponent At the end of these experiments, the four rats with the best performance in cooperation were trained in a reversion treatment (see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1F)</ref> .</s>
          <s>When rats were trained on reversal, the sides of C and D lever were interchanged in subject and opponent chambers.</s>

          <s>In this work, we study the contrasted role between reinforcements in the learning of reciprocal altruism learning in rats.</s>
          <s>Traditionally, reciprocal altruism is achieved by playing the iterated prisoner's dilemma game (iPD) when an experimental subject is confronted to a reciprocal opponent.</s>
          <s>The payoff matrix used has positive and negative reinforcements with high contrasted between positive and negative pairs and also uses discriminating amount of reinforcements <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our experiment, pellets were used as positive reinforcements, and timeout as negative reinforcement.</s>
          <s>In this way, the positive and negative reinforcements acted as strengtheners of mutual cooperation behavior likelihood <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our results show for the first time high levels of cooperation (86,11%) and mutual cooperation (76,32%) in iPD, (see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previous published works have taught reciprocity using iPD game, showing that animals prefer short-term benefits or only improve a poor level of cooperation <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>

          <s>A possible explanation is that using standard matrices (for example: P T = 6, P R = 4, P P = 1, P S = 0), animals were not able to discriminate between the amount of reinforcement obtained in the long-term in comparison to short-term <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example, if a rat played four sessions [C C C C] he would get 16 pellets, and if played [C D D D] he would get 12 pellets.</s>
          <s>In our experiment, rats using the same choices earn 4 pellets and no timeout in the first case, and 3 pellets plus a 16 seconds timeout in the second case.</s>

          <s>A dynamic system can be represented with Markov diagrams and its associated state transition vector.</s>
          <s>In this case, each state (T, R, P, S, see Results section) will have two associated conditional probabilities: to cooperate or not to cooperate given state.</s>
          <s>In an IPD game with an opponent using a Tit for tat strategy, a rational player should maximize the positive reinforcement and cancel the negative reinforcement.</s>
          <s>In this way, while the opponent performed a reciprocal behavior, the player follows an ALLC strategy with conditional cooperation probability near 1, independent of previous states (T, R, P o S).</s>
          <s>In a pay-off matrix with addable value (as for an example (P T = 6, P R = 4, P P = 1, P S = 0), it is possible to calculate the cooperative strategy through mathematical analysis <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref>

          <s>The strategy of the first group, (see <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 1E)</ref> , show that conditional probabilities to cooperation given previous state T, R, P or S were near 1 (0.760, 0.845, 0.929 and 0.870, respectively) and in this fashion after defected they immediately return to the mutual cooperation state, R.

            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32]</ref> and showed that conditional probabilities of cooperation were not high when facing a reciprocal opponent.</s>
          <s>In this protocol, with the matrix (P T = 2, P R = 1, P P = 4s, P S = 8s), there are two theoretical strategies that maximize appetite reinforcement: one is ALLC strategy and the other an alternating between cooperation (C) and defection (D) strategy.</s>
          <s>The latter, also maximizes positive reinforcement when alternating between cooperation and defection options, but it also increases negative reinforcement (timeout).</s>
          <s>In this case, ALLC strategy is the only one that maximizes positive reinforcement and minimizes the negative one (Pareto Optimum).</s>
          <s>Since negative reinforcement is timeout, ALLC strategy gives more food per unit of time.</s>
          <s>In this case, the role of the negative reinforcement appears.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, after animals adopted a strategy, we evaluated if a change in the payoff matrix could modify their behavior.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we studied the effect of modifying positive reinforcements (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig 2A and 2B</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Animals were pre-trained with a payoff matrix where alternating between C and D strategy gives more positive reinforcements than with an ALLC strategy, keeping the same negative reinforcement as in the first experiment.</s>
          <s>We observed that only half of the animals learned to cooperate although all of them obtained the same mean amount reward (pellet) (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig 2C and 2D</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The cooperative group was trained with a matrix where the pay-off T was increased <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig 2A)</ref> , then we observed that cooperative behavior decreased.</s>
          <s>Animals reduced frequency of R state and increased frequency of P state, proving that they preferred a small-immediate option instead of a large-delayed option.</s>
          <s>This behavior is similar to the one observed in birds ( <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In the second group, we applied a matrix that keeps the proportions of reinforcements in T and R similar to the most common matrix (P T = 3p, P R = 2p equal proportion to P T = 6p, P R = 4).</s>
          <s>It was observed that animals modified their behavior and became more cooperative <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig 2B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results show that rats that learned to cooperate with an appropriate matrix stop cooperating when a temptation payoff (T) is sufficiently increased (matrix with high contrast index).</s>
          <s>However, if non-cooperative animals are trained with a matrix that favors cooperation (matrix with low contrast index), they become cooperators.</s>
          <s>In the latter case, the achieved cooperation level was comparable to results shared in diverse bibliography.</s>
          <s>We observe that if an iPD matrix uses large positive reward, it improves less cooperation than one with small rewards, shown that satisfying the relationship among iPD reinforcement was not enough to achieve high mutual cooperation behavior.</s>

        <figDesc>Markov chain diagrams and contrast index. Markov chain diagrams are shown (the size of circle means of occupancy state rate and the arrow's width are proportional to the probability of cooperate given (A) occupancy state and transition probabilities for an animal that disrupted its cooperative behavior when contrast index CI ¼ 1 2 was changed to CI ¼ 2 3 and pay-off matrix was changed [P T , P R , P P , P S ] = [3p, 1p, 4s, 8s] to [5p, 1p, 4s, 8s] (p = pellet and s = seconds). The thickness of blue arrows (conditional probabilities of cooperation) become thinner after change (for values see</figDesc>

        <figDesc>. Scheme of dual operand conditioning chamber. Two operant boxes are placed, one in front of the other in such a way that transparent windows were aligned. In the front panel of each box, there are two light stimulus (green = on / black = off) on the top, two levers in the middle and two windows (red shadow) in down. In the subject box both lights are turned on at the same time when the trial starts, and in the opponent box only a light is on. The opponent was trained to choose the side where the light is on, but the subject has to learn which side maximizes reward.(EPS) S3 Fig. Abbreviations list. (EPS) S4 Fig. Dataset of all treatments.
