          <s>Mean dew point was highest in August (10 °C to 12 °C) and lowest in February (−2 °C to 3 °C).</s>
          <s>"Humidity-range" was larger in the summer months (40% to 44%), and least variable in winter (15% to 18%).</s>
          <s>Mean relative humidity however showed the opposite pattern, typically highest in December (88% to 91%) and lowest in June (70% to 74%).</s>

          <s>RSV and IAV have the largest seasonal peaks, appearing in November-December and December-January respectively.</s>
          <s>IBV (February-March), HMPV (March), and HPIV-3 (April-May) follow sequentially.</s>
          <s>IBV has a biennial distribution occurring every other year.</s>
          <s>HPIV-2 has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in July.</s>
          <s>A clear seasonality is not noticeable for HPIV-1.</s>
          <s>Adenovirus and rhinovirus are present throughout the year.</s>
          <s>Rhinovirus also has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in March.</s>

          <s>The average temperature during the study was 9.2 °C.</s>
          <s>In keeping with their year-round presence, the mean temperature when adenovirus and rhinovirus are present is closer to the annual mean at 8.8 °C and 8.9 °C respectively.</s>
          <s>A preference for colder temperatures is noticeable for RSV, IAV, and IBV (6.3 °C, 6.7 °C and 6.3 °C respectively).</s>
          <s>HMPV is most prevalent when the temperature becomes slightly warmer (7.4 °C).</s>
          <s>HPIV-3 is the only virus to prefer above average temperatures (9.4 °C).</s>

          <s>Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 °C), IAV (3.9 °C), IBV (3.3 °C) and HMPV (4.4 °C) preferring lower dew points.</s>
          <s>In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 °C).</s>

          <s>Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by "humidity-range" and relative humidity.</s>

          <s>Du Prel et al. have reported that air temperature and relative humidity were important factors affecting viral seasonality in Germany over a 6-year period <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>As in our study, air pressure did not have a significant correlation.</s>

          <s>Our data shows that all the viral agents of URTI show degrees of seasonal variation corroborated by the GLM.</s>
          <s>Based on similarity in structures and seasonality, there appear to be three groups.</s>
          <s>1: Non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus and adenovirus) which are present throughout the year.</s>
          <s>2: Enveloped viruses with winter preponderance (RSV, HMPV, IAV and IBV) and 3: Parainfluenza viruses 1-3, enveloped viruses with a preference for warmer temperatures.</s>

          <s>In our study, non-enveloped agents are present year-round with some seasonal variation.</s>
          <s>Adenovirus is known to be stable at high humidity levels (80%) <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since this is very close to the mean humidity for the study period (81%), this could explain the presence of adenovirus throughout the year.</s>
          <s>Davis GW showed that adenovirus survival is better at high humidity levels (89%) than at lower humidity (50%) <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>The peak in March found in our GLM for adenoviruses is different to the December peaks observed for enteric adenoviruses in Japan, though a peak in the winter months is seen when GLM was drawn for 2011, a year when visual peaks for all viruses were present ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1</ref> ) <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our results show that adenoviruses prefer temperatures around 9 °C.</s>

          <s>However, as these two peaks correspond to when children go back to school, it is possible that meteorological factors do not solely account for these peaks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As rhinovirus is present throughout the year, there appears to be no significant difference in meteorological factors on days rhinovirus is present or absent.</s>

          <s>This illustrates the complex interaction between different meteorological factors and hence the difficulty in understanding their specific effects on viral prevalence.</s>

          <s>Unlike HPIV-1 and 2, HPIV-3 increases when temperature is highest (9.4 °C) and when relative humidity is lowest (79.9%).</s>

          <s>Our results indicate that most viruses prefer stable humidity (i.e. a lower "humidity-range") through the day.</s>
          <s>This requires confirmation from further studies.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are some limitations to this study.</s>
          <s>There is a possibility that the samples tested may include those who do not live in the catchment area.</s>
          <s>As the data is anonymised, it is not possible to determine whether the individuals are tourists or residents of the area.</s>
          <s>However, since all samples tested over the time period were analysed we believe that it is as representative as it can be.</s>
          <s>And, as the incubation period in viral respiratory infections is relatively short, it is unlikely that a viral infection will have originated abroad unless the patient was infected just prior to travelling to Edinburgh, which should be a relatively small percentage of the overall population examined in this study.</s>
          <s>Another limitation is that our data only represents those who sought medical care and were then tested.</s>
          <s>Hence a time lag between the individual becoming infected, becoming symptomatic and subsequently becoming unwell enough to require medical attention is present.</s>
          <s>We have not corrected our data for incubation period or for duration of illness prior to sampling.</s>
          <s>We have analysed the proportion of positive results for each virus for each day.</s>
          <s>Since proportion depends both on the number of positive results and on the total number of samples tested, it does not directly reflect the number of positive cases.</s>
          <s>We did not analyse coronavirus seasonality as it was not part of the routine testing panel during that period.</s>
          <s>Since meteorological factors can be interlinked (e.g.</s>
          <s>dew point and relative humidity), examining the effects of individual meteorological factors on viral seasonality can lead to an incomplete picture <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s>
          <s>We hence attempted to tease this out by performing logistic regression on variables which showed an association in the univariate analysis.</s>
          <s>Since dew point was removed to prevent collinearity affecting the results of logistic regression, a new regression could in the future be performed to analyse the impact of dew point by removing temperature.</s>
          <s>There is a preference for stable "humidity-range" in most enveloped viruses except for HPIV-3.</s>
          <s>Following a visual inspection of the minimum and maximum for each variable and comparison with virus seasonality patterns for different viruses, there appeared to be a relationship between "humidity-range" and viral seasonality.</s>
          <s>Hence, we investigated the relationship between "humidity-range" and viral seasonality.</s>
          <s>It would be interesting to assess if a similar relationship is seen with other ranges such as "temperature-range", "dew point-range", etc in the future.</s>
          <s>Relationship with other variables appears to be virus specific.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we need models which can investigate multiple variables for each virus.</s>
          <s>Changes in weather, human behaviour and the immune system can all affect an agent's seasonality and are all interlinked, as seen in the decrease in vitamin D in temperate climates due to the decrease in daylight hours (shorter/cloudier days).</s>
          <s>This also makes it difficult to describe the effect of weather on viral seasonality in isolation.</s>
          <s>Finally, the GLM used in this study has some disadvantages.</s>
          <s>The GLM used does not account for the lag period between people becoming infected and then seeking medical help, and it also cannot model the multiple peaks seen for rhinoviruses.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, average data was used to calculate the GLM.</s>
          <s>This has led to some of the curves not being as smooth as when yearly data is analysed (for e.g. from 2011 a year when peaks were seen for all viruses ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The two steps seen in the curves correspond to the start and end date and probably reflect the lack of samples from January to March in 2009 and the month of December in 2015 as we have analysed data from April 2009 and November 2015.</s>
          <s>Despite this, the average data over the 6.5 years is very similar to that from 2011.</s>
          <s>This helps confirm the seasonality for most viruses.</s>
          <s>There may be differences in individual years as can be seen for adenovirus which had a peak seasonality in December in 2011.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Nonetheless, our findings on temperature, humidity and "humidity-range" could potentially help explain the variation in seasonality between temperate and tropical regions of the world.</s>
          <s>IAV is known to occur throughout the year in South East Asian countries closer to the equator (warm, humid environment) <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our findings on "humidity-ranges" need confirmation in a tropical setting.</s>
          <s>The order of occurrence of different viruses in tropical and temperate regions needs to be investigated in relation to the parameters highlighted.</s>
          <s>Additionally, whether these peaks in viral activity change depending on the age of the population analysed could also be a topic for future research.</s>
          <s>In conclusion, non-enveloped viruses were present throughout the year.</s>
          <s>Enveloped viruses were more seasonal starting from IAV in January to RSV in December with other viruses in between.</s>
          <s>RSV, HPIV-3 and IAV and IBV showing the clearest patterns.</s>
          <s>RSV, IAV and IBV show a clear preference for colder temperature and dew point, as well as consistent humidity.</s>
          <s>In contrast, HPIV showed a preference for higher temperatures.</s>
          <s>Additionally, HPIV-3 demonstrated a significant tolerance to low humidity.</s>
          <s>Hence, meteorological factors like temperature, humidity and "humidity-range" have a significant effect on the incidence of the causative agents of the common cold and changes in meteorological factors could potentially predict the decline of one virus and the emergence of the next.</s>

        <figDesc>Figure 2. Comparison of viral seasonality and mean relative humidity. X axis: Month/Year. Y axis: Monthly mean relative humidity (shaded area) over the study period and % positivity for each virus (coloured lines, scale differs between viruses). Horizontal line is the average relative humidity (81%) across the study period. The line representing the % positivity for each virus demonstrates viral seasonality through the year. It can be compared to the changes in mean relative humidity through the year. In November 2009, HMPV tests were positive 50% of the time, and hence that month's results are high in comparison to all other results. The high prevalence of rhinovirus and HMPV in 2009 may reflect selective testing for these viruses when the test was introduced.</figDesc>

We measured the mean of each meteorological factor on days when we received positive samples for a given virus and on days where we did not receive a positive sample for that virus. Hence a larger difference in means denotes that a virus is commonly present at an extreme of that meteorological factor: e.g. RSV more often being present when temperature is lower.</figDesc>
