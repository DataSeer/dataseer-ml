            <s>Background: Reliable interpretation of the Assessment of Physiotherapy Practice (APP) tool is necessary for consistent assessment of physiotherapy students in the clinical setting.</s>
            <s>However, since the APP was implemented, no study has reassessed how consistently a student performance is evaluated against the threshold standards.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the consistency among physiotherapy educators when assessing a student performance using the APP tool.</s>
            <s>Methods: Physiotherapists (n = 153) from Australia with a minimum 3 years clinical experience and who had supervised a physiotherapy student within the past 12-months were recruited.</s>
            <s>Three levels of performance (not adequate, adequate, good/excellent) were scripted and filmed across outpatient musculoskeletal, neurorehabilitation, cardiorespiratory and inpatient musculoskeletal.</s>
            <s>In the initial phase of the study, scripts were written by academic staff and reviewed by an expert panel (n = 8) to ensure face and content validity as well as clinical relevance prior to filming.</s>
            <s>In the second phase of the study, pilot testing of the vignettes was performed by clinical academics (n = 16) from Australian universities to confirm the validity of each vignette.</s>
            <s>In the final phase, study participants reviewed one randomly allocated vignette, in their nominated clinical area and rated the student performance including a rationale for their decision.</s>
            <s>Participants were blinded to the performance level.</s>
            <s>Percentage agreement between participants was calculated for each vignette with an a priori percentage agreement of 75% considered acceptable.</s>
            <s>Results: Consensus among educators across all areas was observed when assessing a performance at either the 'not adequate' (97%) or the 'good/excellent' level (89%).</s>
            <s>When assessing a student at the 'adequate' level, consensus reduced to 43%.</s>
            <s>Similarly, consensus amongst the 'not adequate' and 'good/excellent' ranged from 83 to 100% across each clinical area; while agreement was between 33 and 46% for the 'adequate' level.</s>
            <s>Percent agreement between clinical educators was 89% when differentiating 'not adequate' from 'adequate' or better.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: Consistency is achievable for 'not adequate' and 'good/excellent' performances, although, variability exists at an adequate level.</s>
            <s>Consistency remained when differentiating an 'adequate' or better from a 'not adequate' performance.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>In 1990, psychologist George Miller proposed a pyramid of hierarchy in the assessment of clinical competence.</s>
          <s>The levels ranged from knows, knows how (competence), shows how and does (performance) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Within health professional programs such as physiotherapy, direct assessment of authentic clinical practice at the 'does' level is required to certify fitness to practice.</s>
          <s>That helps to assure relevant accreditation bodies, registration authorities and the broader population that graduates have met the required standards to safely and effectively practice within their particular health discipline <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Students are required to complete workplace based assessments in conjunction with their academic assessment as part of that credentialing process.</s>
          <s>Given the high stakes of these workplace based performance assessments, it is essential that the assessment practices are valid, reliable and fair to all students <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Reliability of clinical assessment is the extent to which assessment yields consistent outcomes.</s>
          <s>During workplace based clinical placements, a student should expect a level of consistency between the assessors when rating their performance.</s>
          <s>While consistency in assessment is a reasonable expectation, there is a limited amount of research investigating this construct <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In physiotherapy programs across Australia and New Zealand, students are assessed on their competence to deliver entry-level physiotherapy services through completion of multiple longitudinal professional practice placements, commonly referred to as 'clinical placements'.</s>
          <s>The passing or minimally competent standard is defined within the Physiotherapy Practice Threshold Statements <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Across Australia and New Zealand, The Assessment of Physiotherapy Practice (APP) instrument is used in most programs as the measure for assessing student performance against the entry-level standard <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Aligned to the threshold standards, 20 items divided into seven domains of practice (professional behavior, communication, assessment, analysis and planning, intervention, evidence based practice and risk management) are assessed on a 5-point scale (0-4), where a score of two is defined as the minimally competent standard to enter the profession.</s>
          <s>In addition, overall performance is evaluated using a global rating scale (GRS) defined by four distinct categories to differentiate a student's overall performance, namely, not adequate, adequate, good and excellent.</s>
          <s>Rasch analysis has shown the APP to be both reliable and valid in measuring changes in physiotherapy student competence over time <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The APP was introduced in 2009 with empirical evidence to demonstrate strong validity and reliability among educators.</s>
          <s>However, more recently there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting a perceived variability in how educators interpret the APP.</s>
          <s>A recent study by Trede and Smith <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> supported this sentiment, demonstrating assessment practices among physiotherapy educators still relied on subjective factors despite their knowledge of the APP.</s>
          <s>It was observed that assessment practices were predominantly learnt in the workplace with little to no guidance on how to assess students despite training being available to educators <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is plausible that over time such practices have led to variability in the interpretation of the APP.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Reliable interpretation of the APP is necessary for consistent assessment of physiotherapy students in the clinical setting.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, physiotherapy programs and educators have a responsibility to ensure graduates meet the threshold standards by differentiating an inadequate (failing) performance from an adequate performance to ensure an appropriate standard of graduates are entering the profession.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since the implementation of the APP, no study has assessed how consistent student performance is evaluated against the threshold standards.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to determine what level of consistency is achieved between physiotherapy educators when assessing a student's performance via video footage using the global rating scale of the APP.</s>
          <s>Secondly, the study also aimed to identify key attributes that influence educator decisions when applying the global rating scale of the APP.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Based on the study findings, it appears that physiotherapy educators demonstrate consistency in assessing a student at the 'not adequate' and 'good/excellent' level regardless of clinical area.</s>
          <s>However, when assessing the 'adequate' performance, educators demonstrated greater variability and lacked consistency based on the parameters of this study (&gt; 75%).</s>
          <s>Importantly, when adjusted for identifying the 'not adequate' performance from the 'adequate' or better, educators again demonstrated consistency.</s>
          <s>This suggests that physiotherapy educators with a minimum of 3 years clinical experience are consistent at ensuring physiotherapy graduates are achieving at least the minimum entry standard during clinical placements based on the APP GRS.</s>
          <s>However, there is variability in the interpretation of an 'adequate' performance.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The ability for a physiotherapy educator to differentiate between a 'not adequate' and 'adequate' or better performance is a critical decision.</s>
          <s>The primary objective for assessing student performance in the clinical setting is to determine an acceptable level of professional competence, which aims to minimise risk to the community <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Importantly, our results suggest that adequately experienced educators are consistent in their interpretation of the APP GRS when comparing competent and not competent students.</s>
          <s>In contrast, a similar study by Cross, Hicks et al. <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> reported wide variability in clinical educator interpretation of practice based assessment with a tendency among clinical educators to regress to the mean resulting in a failure to fail unsatisfactory performances.</s>
          <s>The study also reported that training in assessment improved the consistency <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A possible rationale for such a discrepancy is the assumption that most participants had previous training in the use of the APP GRS.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, we did not collect data on the level of training undertaken by participants, so it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the impact of this on our findings.</s>
          <s>However, it is common practice among Australian Universities to provide training and support in the assessment and interpretation of the APP to all educators.</s>
          <s>As a result, this may have influenced the level of consensus observed in this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Based on our results, it appears the greatest source of variability occurred when differentiating the 'adequate' performance from the 'good/excellent'.</s>
          <s>A possible rationale for this finding could be the fact that some components of the student assessment are being performed at either a good/excellent level or in some cases a not-adequate level.</s>
          <s>The scripts were purposely written with such variability to reflect actual student performance.</s>
          <s>As a result, an educator's individual bias may have influenced the final decision of whether to award 'adequate' or 'good/excellent' when faced with an ultimatum.</s>
          <s>Analysis of the key behaviours outlined in <ref target="#tab_2" type="table">Table 3</ref> support this assumption, showing that individuals were focused on different aspects of the performance when watching the videos.</s>
          <s>A similar finding was reported by</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Trede and Smith <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , concluding that assessment practices among clinical educators were influenced by socio-material structures shaped through experience, indicating that different personal, professional and environmental factors influence decision making when conducting assessment.</s>
          <s>It is reasonable to conclude that when faced with a difficult decision, such as differentiating between assessment levels on the APP GRS, with limited information, participants within the current study reverted to past experience and context to influence their final decision, which may have resulted in the observed variability.</s>
          <s>Although in research studies, the influence of such bias is minimized by careful sampling, a lack of consistent training among the sample population may have meant that judgement bias had remained an issue <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The primary limitation to the current study was the recognition that the video vignettes created were a one-off student performance lasting on average 20 min.</s>
          <s>However, in practice the APP instrument was designed to be used for the assessment of student performance during longitudinal clinical placement blocks of 4-6 weeks where student assessment of performance can be done on multiple occasions across time and in a diverse range of patient presentations.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, it was not practical to include all assessable attributes of student performance that can be observed across time within a single vignette, limiting the assessor's ability to use a wide range of evidence on which to base their overall rating.</s>

          <s>The study found strong consensus between clinical educators when assessing a 'not adequate' and 'good/excellent' performance.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, consensus existed when differentiating a 'not adequate' from an 'adequate' performance based on the APP GRS.</s>
          <s>However, variability existed when assessing the 'adequate' performance with a lack of consensus in differentiating 'adequate' from 'good/excellent'.</s>
          <s>The resources developed for this body of research are freely available online (http://www.appeducation.com.au/</s>
          <s>videos/2015-video-vignettes.html).</s>
          <s>In recognition that training can improve consistency in clinical education assessment, it is hoped that the videos provide an evidence based resource for developing educator skills so that "we can progress to calibrated assessors who are able to rate student performance consistent with similarly calibrated colleagues" <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, strategies to standardise educator training will only serve to greater improve the consistency in the assessment of student performance using the APP and gain consensus among educators.</s>
