            <s>Background: Although there are public policies for eradicating congenital syphilis, they do not seem to be a routine in most health services.</s>
            <s>The objective of this study was to evaluate the management of sexual partners of pregnant women with syphilis in primary health care in northeastern Brazil.</s>
            <s>Methods: This is a qualitative assessment carried out from February to October 2014 in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, northeastern region of Brazil, through the observation of six primary health care centers and interviews with 21 professionals, six coordinators, nine women diagnosed with syphilis during antenatal care and four sexual partners.</s>
            <s>The data were submitted to thematic content analysis.</s>
            <s>Results: Important flaws were identified at the primary health centers studied regarding the management of syphilis during pregnancy.</s>
            <s>Accessing testing and treatment is difficult, and there are no standardized strategies to notify the partner.</s>
            <s>The responsibility for notifying them is transferred to the women, and counseling does not offer proper guidance nor sufficient emotional support to help them.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The management of pregnant women and their sexual partners in our region does not comply with global recommendations.</s>
            <s>Professional qualification, sensitization, and standardization of health professionals' conduct are necessary.</s>
            <s>Offering support to health professionals on their clinical practices by means of a supervision process may contribute to the adoption of the recommended guidelines and to the promotion of care based on privacy, respect, confidentiality of information, and awareness of the problems faced by women as a result of syphilis diagnosis.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>The reduction in the incidence rate of Congenital Syphilis (CS) to less than 0.5 cases per 1000 live births and its elimination as a public health problem in Latin American and Caribbean countries are goals of national <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> and international <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> health organizations.</s>
          <s>However, CS still remains a challenge for poor and developing countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, which still faced high incidence rates, 1.21, 2.90, and 6.49, respectively, in 2015 <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , mainly due to the poor quality of antenatal care <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In Brazil, national policy guides that pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first antenatal visit <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The test should be repeated during the third trimester of pregnancy and at delivery.</s>
          <s>Seropositive women and their sexual partners should be treated <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The non-treatment of sexual partners is one of the main factors hindering the control of CS <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> and remains a challenge for health professionals.</s>
          <s>Official statistics <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> show that between 1998 and June 2016 only 12.7% of the partners of syphilis seropositive pregnant women were treated.</s>
          <s>This fact emphasizes the importance of efforts to improve on timely and adequate treatment for pregnant women and their partners.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Brazil's Ministry of Health (MOH) states that the notification of sexual partners of persons with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including syphilis in pregnancy, should involve different strategies, which goes from the notification of an index patient to active search of this patient's partner <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These strategies can certainly help health professionals, but it is necessary to consider that the diagnosis of an STI brings to light some delicate situations such as the possibility of unfaithfulness, fear of communicating the diagnosis due to the risk of suffering violence, and fear of breaking off the relationship <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>All these facts can be considered barriers that difficult the treatment of the partners of syphilis-seropositive pregnant women.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite scientific evidence that contacting sexual partners of persons with STIs is difficult <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , it is believed that it is possible to locate partners of pregnant women with syphilis, as these women often live with the fathers of their babies and maintain a link with the primary health care centers <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, treatment should take place at this level of care <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there is a history of invisibility of men in these services <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , which are unattractive from the point of view of men and seen as distinctly feminine spaces <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">20]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In Brazil, some attempts have been made to attract men to health services -for instance, the implementation of the National Comprehensive Healthcare Policy for Men (Política Nacional de Atenção Integral à Saúde do Homem) <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, in order to achieve a better coverage of treatment to sexual partners of pregnant women with syphilis, it is necessary to properly train professionals to meet the subjective demands that arise from diagnosis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Given this context, the present study aims to evaluate the management [notification, testing, treatment and follow-up] of sexual partners of pregnant women with syphilis in primary health care in a metropolitan area of northeastern region of Brazil.</s>

          <s>It is worth highlighting the fact that only 53.4% of Brazilian families were attended to by FHS teams in 2013 <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The city has a population of 2.5 million inhabitants and, as far as health care is concerned, is divided into six Health Coordination Offices (HCO), whose function is to enforce sectoral policies, establish specific goals for each population group and provide articulated services within a social protection network.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The present research was conducted in six PHCs, one from each HCO, whose selection criterion was the number of notifications of syphilis in pregnant women in 2013.</s>

          <s>In the year 2013, 19 pregnant women with syphilis were notified at the evaluated centers.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In order to address the theme more naturally, establish a connection, and help the women feel more comfortable expressing themselves, the interviewers initially asked about the antenatal care and exams done during such period.</s>

          <s>Despite being frequently used in some countries in cases of urethral discharge <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[29]</ref> , patient-delivered prescription is not considered the most appropriate strategy in the case of syphilis because the drug should be injected, and this should be done in a health care facility.</s>

          <s>In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a previous study showed that such worry is mainly related to the fact that the CHA lives in the same area as the patient they serve and have personal relationships with them, which could compromise the uptake and confidentiality of patient's information <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the CHA is a member of the Family Health Strategy team and difficulties in dealing with issues arising from STI diagnosis are not specific to this category <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The concern for confidentiality within primary care may be related to the fact that men with STI's prefer to be treated at private centers or drugstores far from their home, as shown in other studies <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[32,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>In order to make the eradication of congenital syphilis a reality in Brazil, professional qualification, sensitization, and the standardization of health professionals' conducts are necessary.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, primary health care centers must undergo a supervision process offering support for the implementation of the recommended guidelines and for the promotion of care based on privacy, respect, and confidentiality of information.</s>
