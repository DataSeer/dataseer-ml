            <s>Neuropeptides play pivotal roles in modulating circadian rhythms.</s>
            <s>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is critical to the circadian rhythms in Drosophila locomotor activity.</s>
            <s>Here, we demonstrate that diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) complements PDF function in regulating free-running rhythmicity using male flies.</s>
            <s>We determined that Dh31 loss-of-function mutants (Dh31 #51 ) showed normal rhythmicity, whereas Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants exhibited a severe arrhythmic phenotype compared to Pdf-null mutants (Pdf 01 ).</s>
            <s>The expression of tethered-PDF or tethered-DH31 in clock cells, posterior dorsal neurons 1 (DN1ps), overcomes the severe arrhythmicity of Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants, suggesting that DH31 and PDF may act on DN1ps to regulate free-running rhythmicity in a hierarchical manner.</s>
            <s>Unexpectedly, the molecular oscillations in Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 mutants were similar to those in Pdf 01 mutants in DN1ps, indicating that DH31 does not contribute to molecular oscillations.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, a reduction in Dh31 receptor (Dh31r) expression resulted in normal locomotor activity and did not enhance the arrhythmic phenotype caused by the Pdf receptor (Pdfr) mutation, suggesting that PDFR, but not DH31R, in DN1ps mainly regulates free-running rhythmicity.</s>
            <s>Taken together, we identify a novel role of DH31, in which DH31 and PDF hierarchically regulate free-running rhythmicity through DN1ps.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>In Drosophila, pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is required for robust locomotor behavioral output 1 .</s>
            <s>PDF coordinates circadian networks and controls the timing of morning and evening peaks in locomotor activity 2-6 .</s>
            <s>In the absence of PDF (Pdf 01 ), flies show a loss of morning anticipation, an advanced evening activity peak, shorter free-running periods, and dampened molecular oscillations in clock cells 7-11 , suggesting that PDF is a main neuropeptide responsible for orchestrating the activity of each pacemaker neuron.</s>
            <s>However, the lack of PDF does not completely dampen free-running rhythm; approximately half of Pdf 01 mutants still maintain weak rhythmic locomotor activity under constant dark (DD) conditions 9,10 .</s>
            <s>The data suggest that PDF may not be the only molecule responsible for regulating free-running rhythmicity.</s>
            <s>Therefore, we sought to identify another neuropeptide that complements the role of PDF in free-running rhythmicity.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>In addition to PDF, diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) activates the PDF receptor (PDFR), which regulates locomotor activity 12 .</s>
            <s>DH31 is expressed in clock neurons in the brain.</s>
            <s>An RNA-seq analysis using sorted clock cells in the brain suggested that DH31 is expressed in lateral neurons (LNvs) and dorsal neurons 1 (DN1s) 13 , and DH31 antibody staining shows that DH31 is expressed in posterior dorsal neurons 1 (DN1ps) 14,15 .</s>
            <s>However, we and others have shown that Dh31 mutants exhibit normal locomotor activity rhythms <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
              <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Along with locomotor activity rhythms, DH31 plays roles in sleep and temperature preference rhythm (TPR).</s>
            <s>A recent study showed that PDF signaling is relayed to DN1s, which express DH31, to promote awakening at dawn 14 .</s>
            <s>We also recently showed that DH31 acts on dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) via PDFR to modulate TPR, particularly the decrease in preferred temperature at the transition from day to night 15 .</s>
            <s>Therefore, we hypothesized that normal locomotor activity rhythms in Dh31 single mutants might be a result of normal PDF signaling.</s>
            <s>To this end, we examined locomotor activity rhythms using Dh31-Pdf double mutants.</s>

          <s>To re-evaluate the function of DH31 in regulating the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, we focused on a double mutant of Dh31 #51 (a loss-of-function mutant) <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> and Pdf 01 (a null mutant) <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> and examined the phenotypes for rhythmicity, free-running period, morning anticipation and evening activity peaks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We determined that both w 1118 (WT) and Dh31 #51 mutant flies maintained a robust free-running rhythmicity (WT: 92% rhythmic, power = 1371.7,</s>
          <s>Dh31 #51 : 93% rhythmic, power = 678.2) <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1A</ref> ,F,G and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These data are consistent with previous reports using Dh31 #51 mutants <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> and another Dh31 mutant <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, the Pdf 01 mutants exhibited a weak free-running rhythmicity (40% rhythmic, power = 243.0)</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1A</ref> ,H and <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref> , which is also consistent with previous reports 9, <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, we determined that the free-running rhythmicity of Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants was strongly disrupted: 92% of the flies exhibited an arrhythmic phenotype, and only 8% showed weak amplitudes (power = 226.7)</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1A</ref> ,I and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These data indicate that the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double-mutant phenotype is more severely arrhythmic than either single mutant, suggesting that DH31 is involved in modulating free-running rhythmicity.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We also determined that the free-running period of the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants was 23.1 h ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1I</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ), which was slightly longer than that of the Pdf 01 mutants (22.5 h; <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1H</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ) and shorter than that of the Dh31 #51 mutants (24.4 h; <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1G</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These data indicate that the Dh31 mutation did not enhance the shorter period caused by the Pdf mutation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In terms of morning anticipation, compared to WT flies, both the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants and Dh31 #51 mutants exhibited abnormal morning anticipation ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, the anticipation indexes of the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants and Dh31 #51 mutants were not significantly different <ref type="table">(Table S2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, both the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants and Pdf 01 mutants similarly exhibited approximately one-hour advanced peaks in evening activity, which occurred at ZT 10.5-11 (Figs 1D,E and S1 and Tables S3, S4).</s>
          <s>Thus, the Dh31 mutation did not enhance the abnormal patterns of morning and evening anticipation caused by the Pdf mutation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In summary, we determined that the lack of DH31 strongly enhanced the arrhythmic phenotype induced by the Pdf mutation but did not affect the free-running period, morning anticipation or timing of the evening activity peak in Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we examined the functions of DH31 in regulating free-running rhythmicity, with a particular focused on the relationship between DH31 and PDF.</s>

          <s>DH31 in tim-Gal4-expressing neurons contributes to free-running rhythmicity.</s>
          <s>Given that Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double-mutant flies exhibited disrupted free-running rhythmicity and that Dh31 #51 mutants still showed normal free-running rhythmicity ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref> , it is likely that an abnormal Dh31 #51 phenotype might be invisible in the presence of normal PDF signaling.</s>
          <s>To examine this possibility, we asked whether DH31 expression in clock neurons could overcome the changes in rhythmicity identified in Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants.</s>
          <s>Because we and others showed that DH31 is expressed in a subset of circadian clock cells (DN1ps) <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> , we first expressed DH31 in DN1ps using R18H11-Gal4 (a DN1p driver) <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. S4B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, 73% of the rescued flies exhibited arrhythmicity (Figs S3G, S4B, and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> : R18H11-Gal4 &gt; UAS-Dh31, Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 ), which was similar to the results for the Gal4 and UAS control flies <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. S3D</ref> ,F and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> : R18H11-Gal4/+, Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 , +/UAS-Dh31, Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 ).</s>
          <s>These data suggest that DH31 expression in R18H11-Gal4-expressing neurons is not sufficient to restore free-running rhythmicity.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>R18H11-Gal4 is expressed in only ~ four to six DN1ps 14 , and we also found that DH31 is expressed in anterior DN1s (DN1as) (Supplemental <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. S5</ref> ).</s>
          <s>As such, DH31 expression from non-R18H11-Gal4-expressing DN1s might also play a role in regulating free-running rhythmicity.</s>
          <s>We therefore expressed DH31 using tim-Gal4 (a driver for all clock cells) in the Dh31 #51 ;Pdf 01 double mutants and assessed whether DH31 expression alone could prevent the severe arrhythmicity.</s>

          <s>These findings suggest that Dh31 #51 mutants maintain a robust free-running rhythm because the primary factor, PDF, can sustain a strong rhythm <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Figs 1 and 6)</ref> .</s>
          <s>We showed that ~40% of Pdf 01 single-mutant flies exhibited a preserved rhythmic state, which is because DH31 can partially support free-running rhythmicity.</s>

          <s>Several recent studies in Drosophila have identified the neuropeptides, including ion transport peptide (ITP) <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">37</ref> , neuropeptide F (NPF) <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38</ref> , allatostatin A 39 , short neuropeptide F 40 , leucokinin <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> and DH44 21 , that regulate locomotor activity and sleep.</s>
          <s>However, given that DH31 complements the function of PDF in regulating free-running rhythmicity in the same clock cells, DH31 not only serves as one of the neuropeptides that regulates circadian rhythms but also might selectively influence PDF function in the regulation of free-running rhythms.</s>
          <s>Thus, our findings shed new light on the next steps required to improve our understanding of the core neuropeptide regulatory mechanisms involved in the circadian rhythm.</s>
