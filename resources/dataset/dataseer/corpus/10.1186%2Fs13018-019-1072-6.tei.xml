            <s>Background: To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the curative effect of treating the full thickness tear of the rotator cuff using the arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (BMS) technology and provide the evidence for its extensive clinical application.</s>
            <s>Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to evaluate the studies on comparison of the curative effect of routine surgery with or without BMS on rotator cuff tear in the major medical databases.</s>
            <s>The literature was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion standards, and the quality assessment was conducted, then Review Manager 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis.</s>
            <s>Results: Eight articles were eligible for inclusion.</s>
            <s>There were no statistically significant differences between BMS and control groups for overall outcome scores (P &gt; 0.05).</s>
            <s>Except the Constant score of BMS group was significantly higher than that of the control group at the third follow-up month (P = 0.007).</s>
            <s>However, the postoperative re-tear rate of the BMS group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.001).</s>
            <s>Furthermore, we made a subgroup analysis and found that the postoperative Constant and UCLA score had no significant differences among all groups (P &gt; 0.05), and the re-tear rates of the BMS groups were lower than those of the control groups (P = 0.001, P = 0.0002).</s>
            <s>Conclusions: BMS technology has no significant influence on the postoperative clinical result of patients.</s>
            <s>However, it can obviously promote the tendon-to-bone healing of the rotator cuff and decrease the re-tear rate, which provides evidence for the clinical treatment.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>The rotator cuff tear is one of the common shoulder diseases.</s>
          <s>The incidence is rising with the increase of age, which could be approximately 50% of the over-60s and up to 80% of the over-80s <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Currently, arthroscopic surgery is the primary surgical treatment, with single-row or double-row anchor fixation suturing.</s>
          <s>The rotator cuff is composed of longitudinal collagen fiber and few blood vessels, leading to its poor self-repairing capability.</s>
          <s>While existing fixation methods are mostly making the tendon direct contact with bone, which results in the difficulty of healing, as lacking normal fibrocartilage structure, especially for the large-massive rotator cuff tear <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , literature reports that the re-tear rate of repaired large-massive rotator cuff tear is as high as 30-94% <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, more and more scholars have paid great attention to the biological repair of tendon-to-bone interface instead of only fixing with anchor so as to increase the fixation intensity.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are lots of reports on the biological repair technology promoting tendon-to-bone healing, such as the platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and autologous tendon cell transplantation <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the efficacy of these methods is unsatisfactory, especially for the large-massive rotator cuff tear.</s>
          <s>Bryan et al. made a systematic evaluation on the PRP-related META analysis of recent years and found that the highest evidence showed applying the PRP during the surgery generally cannot improve the re-tear rate and clinical function compared with the control <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>And some scholars considered that the adipose-derived MSCs or autologous tendon cells applied only to the small rotator cuff tear because of the too complicated operation <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Bone marrow stimulation (BMS) technology of subchondral bone has been confirmed by many scholars and is supposed to promote the biological repair of cartilage defect of the knee or ankle joint <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The "crimson duvet" was proposed to be applied to the shoulder rotator cuff repair by Snyder in 2009 for the first time, which could provide MSCs with the micro-fracture treatment on the footprint <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a simple, secure, and effective biological repair technology, it has received increasing attention from scholars in recent years.</s>
          <s>More and more evidence in animal experiments showed that the overflowing MSCs to the tendon-to-bone interface could rebuild the fibrocartilage structure so as to increase the ultimate force to failure <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, recent researches had the inconsistent result: applying the BMS did not show any clinical advantage over the control group <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, this study plans to make a meta-analysis on the related literature to evaluate whether the application of BMS in the rotator cuff neoplasty will impact the re-tear rate and the clinical consequence, which hopes to provide an evidence for the clinical treatment.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our hypothesis was that BMS would significantly improve outcomes or re-tear rates of patients with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair when compared with controls.</s>

          <s>However, the fibrocartilage layer of normal tendon-to-bone structure always is often unable to regenerate after the rotator cuff neoplasty, which is only filled up with the scar tissue formed by the collagen fiber.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the tensile strength is largely reduced, and re-tear occurs more easily under stress with normal intensity <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>The stem cells have huge potential in repairing the rotator cuff injury, which can differentiate towards the tendon tissue to achieve the purpose of repairing when stimulated by the endogenous or exogenous stress.</s>
          <s>The differentsource-derived stem cells have increasingly played an important role in the healing of tendon-to-bone interface, including the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and adipose-derived stem cell (ASC).</s>
          <s>Ouyang showed that the allogeneic BMSCs transplanted to the patellar tendon of the rabbit were differentiated into tendon-like cells 5 weeks later <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Chong found that injecting the BMSCs in the early period of tendon injury could effectively promote the healing and improve its biological mechanical property <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Beitzel made a retrospective analysis on applying the BMSCs to repair the rotator cuff injury.</s>
          <s>Seven articles demonstrated it could promote the healing and 1 showed no significant efficacy <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>

          <s>With the development of arthroscopic technology, some scholars have studied to apply the BMSCs during the arthroscopic repairing of rotator cuff injury.</s>
          <s>Hernigou injected the concentrated BMSCs into the tendon-to-bone interface, and after a 24-month follow-up, they found that the healing rate of the experimental group was significantly higher compared with the control group (100% vs 67%) and the re-tear rate was significantly lower (13% vs 56%) <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Yokoya applied the BMSCs combined with biological absorbable materials and demonstrated that BMSCs can increase the secretion of collagen I and enhance the mechanical strength of the regenerated rotator cuff <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The clinical application of the BMSCs has been limited by such factors as the following: (1) large cost and time consumption for BMSCs extraction, culture, and differentiation; (2) possible complications of severe pain and infection caused by bone marrow aspiration before the surgery; and (3) gradual decrease of BMSC quantity with aging and so on <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the "crimson duvet," one of BMS technology, was proposed by Snyder in 2009.</s>
          <s>He suggested drilling at the trochiter under arthroscopy to overflow the BMSCs and growth factors from the marrow cavity and repairing the rotator cuff routinely at the same time, which could improve the biological repair of the tendon-to-bone interface.</s>
          <s>This is a simple technology without the need for any special instrument, an increase of any additional injury or complication, showing its obvious advantages.</s>
          <s>Although there is little evidence for the efficacy of this technology.</s>
          <s>The latest related researches on rotator cuff injury model indeed have shown that BMSCs can effectively promote the tendon-to-bone healing.</s>
          <s>Mazzocca obtained the bone marrow from the anchor and separated it to confirm the existence of BMSCs, which have the osteogenic potential and can promote the healing of rotator cuff injury <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In the meanwhile, our result displayed that the BMS delivered a satisfactory short-term efficacy within 3 months after the surgery.</s>
          <s>Thus, we cannot hastily conclude that BMS cannot improve the clinical outcome of patients.</s>
          <s>The score of clinical outcome cannot entirely substitute the efficacy of BMS, while the regular and long-term follow-up is also very important.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Some clinical factors will impact the healing of the rotator cuff.</s>
          <s>One of the problems in BMS is the absence of a standard process.</s>
          <s>Different studies adopted different strategies.</s>
          <s>This meta-analysis reported the instruments, process, and the corresponding location of BMS in these studies ( <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The subgroup analysis showed that BMS groups in four retrospective cohort studies had a significant decline in postoperative re-tear rate compared with the control.</s>
          <s>BMS technologies they used were similar: using osteotome with 2.1 mm diameters to drill on the region from the edge of the cartilage defect site to the lateral border of trochiter at an interval of 4-5 mm and depth of 10 mm.</s>
          <s>But this might be not the best plan.</s>
          <s>Some defects exist when BMS treatment is conducted in footprint, such as uneven distribution of bone marrow.</s>
          <s>The treatment will be a failure if the drilling density in the unit area is too small, while too large density will significantly damage the cancellous bone of trochiter, which is not favorable for bone remodeling.</s>
          <s>In addition, the drilling being too near the anchor area is prone to reduce the fixation intensity of the anchor.</s>
          <s>Thus, Cai and Zhang improved the BMS technology by acquiring high drilling density using the diameter of 0.5 mm <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This method has an advantage of drilling at multiple points to widen and homogenize the distribution of MSCs in footprint and minimize the damage to the cancellous bone.</s>
          <s>Yet this makes MSCs to be drained from the footprint more easily.</s>

          <s>This study has some limitations: Firstly, 4 of 8 articles selected in our meta-analysis are RCT research, while the rest are retrospective cohort research.</s>
          <s>Although it has been found via the subgroup analysis that the final results of different types of research are almost the same, yet this will undoubtedly increase the selection bias of this study.</s>
          <s>Secondly, the included clinical researches have certain heterogeneity: single-row or double-row repair, different sizes of tear, and different schemes adopted for BMS.</s>
          <s>Thirdly, lack of literature has hindered us in sufficient subgroup analysis, including the position, size, time, fatty infiltration of the tear.</s>
