            <s>Background: Published data revealed that host genetic variants have a substantial influence on sepsis susceptibility.</s>
            <s>However, the results have been inconsistent.</s>
            <s>We aimed to systematically review the published studies and quantitatively evaluate the effects of these variants on the risk of sepsis.</s>
            <s>Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Knowledge, and HuGE databases to identify studies that investigated the associations between genetic variants and sepsis risk.</s>
            <s>Then, we conducted meta-analyses of the associations for genetic variants with at least three study populations and applied the Venice criteria to assess the association result credibility.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Results: A literature search identified 349 eligible articles that investigated 405 variants of 172 distinct genes.</s>
            <s>We performed 204 primary and 185 subgroup meta-analyses for 76 variants of 44 genes.</s>
            <s>The results showed that 29 variants of 23 genes were significantly associated with the risk of sepsis, including 8 variants of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), 14 variants of cytokines, one variant of an immune-related gene and 6 variants of other genes.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, the cumulative epidemiological evidence of a significant association between each variant and the risk of sepsis was classified as strong or moderate for 18 variants.</s>
            <s>For the 329 variants with fewer than three study populations, 63 variants of 48 genes have been reported to be significantly associated with the risk of sepsis in a systematic review.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: We identified several genetic variants that could influence the susceptibility to sepsis by systematic review and meta-analysis.</s>
            <s>This study provides a comprehensive overview of the genetic architecture of variants involved in sepsis susceptibility and novel insight that may affect personalized targeted treatment in the future clinical management of sepsis.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and it is a major, underrecognized health-care problem worldwide <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite modern resuscitating strategies and new anti-infective options, sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The international expert consensus is that the heterogeneity of patients with sepsis might be in part responsible for the failure of clinical trials of treatments for patients with sepsis <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, reliable markers that can identify high-risk patients are urgently needed to improve detection and preventive care.</s>
          <s>Sorensen and colleagues <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[4]</ref> reported that adult adoptees had a 5.81-fold increased risk of dying from infection if one of their biologic parents died of infection before the age of 50.</s>
          <s>This risk exceeded the relative risk (RR) of dying of cancer or cardiovascular disease, suggesting for the first time that host genetics might play an important role in the development of infectious diseases.</s>
          <s>Since then, increasing evidence has suggested that genetic variants, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are critical determinants of inter-individual differences in both inflammatory responses and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recently, many investigators have reported associations between host genetic variants containing SNPs, insertion/deletions (Ins/Del), and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in genes that regulate the host's immune response and sepsis susceptibility <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, due to power considerations in single variant studies with relatively small sample sizes, the outcomes of these studies remain contradictory, and no systematic review investigating all tested variants has been published thus far.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The present study applied a systematic review and meta-analysis approach with a predefined protocol to clarify the potential associations between host genetic variants and the risk of sepsis.</s>

          <s>Strong associations with sepsis risk were defined as ORs ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67.</s>

For rs5743708 Arg753Gln in the TLR2 gene, there was no significant association found in the overall analysis of 14 studies. However, the association between Arg753Gln and the risk of sepsis was significant in the adult population (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.11-2.75, P = 0.02 for the dominant model and OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.20- 3.48, P = 0.009 for the allelic model). In contrast, there was a marginally significantly decreased risk of sepsis as- sociated with Arg753Gln in pediatric studies (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.20-0.89, P = 0.02 for the dominant model and OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.21-0.90, P = 0.03 for the allelic model)</figDesc>

            <s>In summary, we performed the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence linking genetic variants to the susceptibility to sepsis.</s>
            <s>Several genetic variants were confirmed to be significantly associated with the risk of sepsis.</s>
            <s>We hope that this unprecedented collection of data might represent a useful platform for investigators involved in this research field.</s>
