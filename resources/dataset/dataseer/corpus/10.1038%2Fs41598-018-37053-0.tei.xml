            <s>High serum uric acid (UA) has been reported to be associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction; however, the relationship between UA and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a sensitive biomarker of heart failure, is still unclear.</s>
            <s>This study investigated their relationship to provide an accurate assessment of high UA.</s>
            <s>The study patients consisted of 3,077 subjects who underwent cardiac catheterization because of various cardiovascular disorders.</s>
            <s>Since the explanatory factors of multiple regression analysis were mostly confounding with each other, subgroup analysis was performed by quartering the study population using the respective risk factors and by covariance structure analysis.</s>
            <s>This analysis revealed that UA was almost always well associated with a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF), but generally not with BNP.</s>
            <s>UA was significantly associated with BNP in lean aged females, but not in obese adolescent males, although LVEF was significantly reduced in response to a high UA in both groups.</s>
            <s>A high UA is a direct risk factor for cardiac dysfunction from the perspective of BNP; however, augmentation of BNP in response to a high UA would likely be restricted among obese adolescent males.</s>
            <s>On the other hand, the observed LV systolic dysfunction, such as LVEF, reflects a high UA on an almost constant basis.</s>

            <s>High serum uric acid (UA) has recently been discussed not only as a gout culprit but also as a cause of cardiovascular disorders.</s>
            <s>According to previous studies, serum UA levels predict the progression of chronic kidney disease and the development of stroke 1-3 .</s>
            <s>Additionally, high serum UA is associated with the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome 4-8 .</s>
            <s>High serum UA levels also predict an increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure 3,9-13 .</s>
            <s>Recently, we reported that high UA is causally associated with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with ischemic heart disease.</s>
            <s>Importantly, the effect of high UA on LV dysfunction is exerted not only through an atherosclerotic process in the coronary arteries (cardiac ischemia) but also directly, as represented by a possible cause-and-effect relationship 14 .</s>

          <s>This study was planned to revalidate the harmful effects of high serum UA on LV function from the perspective of plasma BNP, which is regarded as a sensitive biomarker of LV dysfunction.</s>
          <s cert="0.9915478825569153" id="dataset-4" type="Tabular data">Thus, the precise relationship among serum UA, plasma BNP and LVEF was examined in a large number of patients with cardiovascular diseases.</s>
          <s>First, we performed a multivariate analysis, which showed that high serum UA was a significant cause of reduced LVEF but did not affect plasma BNP.</s>
          <s>This result represents a curious consequence because serum UA, LVEF and plasma BNP were closely linked in the single regression analysis.</s>
          <s>We then hypothesized that some surrounding factors mediate high serum UA and high plasma BNP, blunting their authentic relationship.</s>
          <s>By reference to the single regression analysis including surrounding factors, we proposed hierarchical equation models in the respective subgroups.</s>
          <s>Importantly, the models clearly demonstrated that 1) high serum UA was sharply associated with reduced LVEF and that 2) plasma BNP authentically responded to high serum UA, but only under the appropriate conditions, such as among lean aged females but never among obese, adolescent males.</s>

        <p>
          <s cert="0.974083662033081" id="dataset-5" type="Tabular data">As observed above, we reaffirmed that high serum UA is a risk factor for cardiac dysfunction, which can be evaluated not only by LVEF but also by plasma BNP, even under some limitations.</s>
          <s>Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the unfavorable effects of high serum UA on the heart have not been precisely examined, potential mechanisms are as follows.</s>
          <s>The UA level is elevated with subsequent upregulation of the xanthine oxidase (XO) enzymatic pathway, which accounts for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[26]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[27]</ref>

          <s>High XO-induced ROS production would be significant throughout the whole body, but the precise mechanism in the local heart has not been well clarified.</s>
          <s>However, it has recently been reported that cardiac function is reduced in accordance with energy deficiency, which is linked to possible cardiac UA production and XO activity <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>If XO enzymatic activity is sufficiently upregulated for a local increase in oxidative stress in the heart, BNP production may also be activated under such circumstances 32 .</s>
          <s>As outlined above, high serum UA, high plasma BNP and low LVEF would be mutually related in heart failure by oxidative stress, which is probably activated not only throughout the whole body but also locally in the heart.</s>
          <s>The possible reasons or mechanisms for blunting the close linkage between serum UA and plasma BNP under a given set of conditions are as follows.</s>
          <s>First, we briefly describe the possible reasons for the beclouded linkage between serum UA and plasma BNP from the perspective of obesity.</s>
          <s>The molecular mechanisms have just started to be examined; however, it has recently been reported that natriuretic peptide reduces body mass by improving the biological function of adipocytes and accelerating fat burning <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, free fatty acid suppresses the production of BNP <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>These pathological actions would lead to a close linkage between low fat content and high plasma BNP or between high fat content and low plasma BNP.</s>
          <s>However, it is quite natural that high body mass would be substantially linked to high UA, suggesting that adipose tissue or FFA has different effects on serum UA (raising) and plasma BNP (lowering).</s>
          <s>Thus, the authentic correlation between serum UA and plasma BNP becomes less visible in obesity.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Second, it is well accepted that serum UA is higher in youth because of increased metabolic activity, high physical activity and a high level of food intake without a relationship to heart failure status.</s>
          <s>Additionally, the plasma BNP level would generally be low in the young population compared with the aged population 24 .</s>
          <s>Ageing then likely has different effects on serum UA (raising) and plasma BNP (lowering); thus, the authentic correlation between serum UA and plasma BNP becomes less apparent in the adolescent population.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Third, the strong linkage was absolute between serum UA and plasma BNP in females; however, the linkage disappeared in males.</s>
          <s>It is difficult to proceed with a discussion of the precise mechanism(s).</s>
          <s>Sex steroid hormones may be associated with serum UA <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[36]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, a close linkage between serum UA and plasma BNP was hardly observed in any stage of renal dysfunction.</s>
          <s>The reasons or mechanisms are unknown; however, other risk factors including ageing, male gender and obesity, which are highly correlated with renal dysfunction, would have substantially affected the values of UA and BNP in diverse ways.</s>
          <s>Importantly, the close correlation between serum UA and reduced LVEF was mostly recognizable in advanced stages of renal dysfunction in this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The direct effect of high serum UA on cardiac damage would be definite based on the results of the current and our previous study <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, this study clearly demonstrated that the adverse effect of high serum UA on heart failure status would likely be underestimated only by measuring plasma BNP, which must be dealt with carefully in clinical practice.</s>
          <s>It is important to search for factors or clinical parameters that are strongly associated with serum UA.</s>
          <s>For example, oxidative stress markers may be conceivable.</s>
          <s>Additionally, the direct measurement of XO activity in the circulation enters the picture.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the harmful effects of high serum UA are almost always demonstrated by the observed cardiac function such as the LVEF.</s>
          <s>In a further study, we should investigate whether high serum UA is more likely linked to patients with heart failure with an reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or to those with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Limitations of this study.</s>
          <s>This was a cross-sectional study, and regarding the underlying diseases of the patients in this study, most had ischemic heart disease (84.2%).</s>
          <s>Further analysis is warranted to determine the adverse effect of high UA prospectively in a large number and various kinds of patients with heart failure.</s>
          <s>Additionally, in the present study, we did not directly examine the biological interaction between BNP and UA.</s>
          <s>Therefore, there may be a limitation to determining whether UA affects BNP or whether BNP affects UA as a definitive conclusion.</s>

        <figDesc>Figure 4. Single regression analysis between UA and LVEF and between UA and Log BNP among obese, adolescent males, and among lean, aged females These upper and lower panels demonstrate a single regression analysis between UA and LVEF, and UA and Log BNP among each group, divided into obese, adolescent males (upper panels: age &lt;67 years and BMI ≥ 24.2 kg/m 2 ) and lean, aged females (lower panels: age ≥67 years and BMI &lt; 24.2 kg/m 2 ). Scatter plots and a simple regression line (orange straight line) with the regression equation demonstrate the correlation between the two values among UA, plasma BNP, and LVEF. BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; UA, uric acid.</figDesc>
