        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>There have been many research works devoted to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).</s>
          <s>The studies include measuring the attention level of the user <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , the workload <ref type="bibr">[2; 3; 4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>BCIs, have, for example, been used for activity recognition <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , to explicitly interact with applications <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> and games as well as to control the movement of real objects <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Combining BCIs with the additional sensors such as eye-tracking <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , gyroscope <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> added more degrees of freedom for the user (e.g.</s>
          <s>selection of the object is done via eye-tracking and the command is performed using BCIs).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The domain of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) itself has emerged and motivated different studies on different levels of abstraction <ref type="figure">(Fig 1)</ref> , either related to hardware development <ref type="figure">(Fig 1, level 1)</ref> , to the signal processing and classification algorithms <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig 1, level 2)</ref> , studying the underlying neural mechanisms <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig 1, level 3)</ref> or the actual applications which use BCIs as an interaction modality <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig 1, level 4)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, despite all this technological progress, the adoption of BCIs as an input modality is still quite moderate aside from more « proof-of-concept » applications.</s>
          <s>We argue that it is in part related to the fact that the BCIs and its commands are not self-revealing <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> : both users and designers should know which commands are available and how to trigger them.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is currently a gap as no design space on BCIs exists that would help the users, designers and researchers to better understand, compare and reason about the appropriate solutions the BCIs could provide to them.</s>
          <s>The challenge is to propose a design space, which would be a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 simple to use by the researchers and users who may not be familiar with the full state of the art on BCIs.</s>
          <s>Our goal is to provide a useful and general framework for defining the conceptual space that could be used for comparing works in this space, and to generalize and unify the preceding proposed classifications.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To address this issue we decide to inspire ourselves from the taxonomies that already exist in HCI by proposing a conceptual space that has descriptive, comparative and generative objectives.</s>
          <s>This space will:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• Group the existing interaction techniques for BCIs • Facilitate their comparison • Facilitate the generation of new techniques.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We introduce a conceptual space, as taxonomy of different features used in EEG-based BCI applications.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To demonstrate the coverage of the conceptual space, we have classified 40 existing BCI systems.</s>
          <s>The analysis of our conceptual space per se reveals directions for future research.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our manuscript is organized as follows: although the main contribution of this work is a design space, we begin our paper by defining what BCIs are and provide examples of the great variety of systems that use BCIs.</s>
          <s>This analysis is done to clarify the terminology for the researchers and users who will read this paper.</s>
          <s>We also provide a short summary in the beginning and in the end of each section.</s>
          <s>We then present our conceptual space for BCI applications.</s>
          <s>We discuss future directions for research in the form of case scenarios that our conceptual space has supported.</s>
          <s>Our expectation is to propose new insights for facilitating the design of novel BCI systems and to further elicit their use and acceptance by the broader public.</s>

          <s>For this reason our conceptual space rests on the notions both from HCI and BCI.</s>
          <s>In order to facilitate the reading of this document, we introduce in the following section the necessary background on BCIs to better understand the choices behind our design space.</s>
          <s>This is not an extensive state of the art about BCIs (for example, invasive BCIs are not mentioned at all in this paper), but this section provides the necessary basics on BCIs in order to better understand their advantages and drawbacks.</s>

        <head>Defining BCIs. BCI vocabulary</head>
        <p>
          <s>Here is a broad definition of Brain-Computer Interfaces: "BCIs allow capturing the brain activity of users by processing and/or classifying their brain signals with the purpose of controlling any system".</s>
          <s>A crucial component for BCIs is ability of users to produce stable brain signal patterns in order to facilitate their recognition.</s>
          <s>Here, we define this skill as "BCI training/learning".</s>
          <s>BCI training could require days of training and repetitive practice.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>BCI systems nowadays are mostly designed to be a "closed loop between a user and the system.</s>
          <s>Generally, the user interacts with the system and the system gives feedback about its state after the interaction" <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, a BCI system can also be an open loop, where a user is unaware of the way the system uses their recorded brain activity <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The notion of BCI loop was first introduced by <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> and contains the following main steps <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref> : signal acquisition (recording of brain activity); signal processing (to remove artefacts); classification (to identify the control signal); feedback/application (to provide information on the outcome of the command and/or brain activity).</s>
          <s>The research in BCIs nowadays is focused over all steps of this loop.</s>
          <s>The steps of the loop correspond to different levels of abstractions to study BCIs we introduced on <ref type="figure">Fig 1.</ref>
          </s>
          <s>We now review these abstractions levels.</s>

        <head>Abstraction level 1: Signal acquisition</head>
        <p>
          <s>In this subsection we show, that there are several different mechanisms to measure the brain activity of the person, and each of them has the advantages and the drawbacks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Signal acquisition is based either on invasive or non-invasive methods.</s>
          <s>Invasive acquisition methods imply opening up or drilling the cranium in order to insert sensors that measure the electrical activity of a restricted area directly on the brain.</s>
          <s>One of the most common invasive acquisition techniques is Electrocorticography (ECoG), where electrodes are implanted in the desired cortex of the brain where the activity occurs <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In contrast, non-invasive methods rely on measuring brain activity by placing sensors on the scalp or around the head without the need of surgical intervention.</s>
          <s>Non-invasive modalities are more sensitive to noise and measure an attenuated signal compared to invasive acquisition methods.</s>
          <s>We briefly review some of the main non-invasive acquisition modalities.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Electroencephalography (EEG).</s>
          <s>EEG is the most commonly used technique to measure this activity: electrodes are placed on the scalp and can be used in pairs to measure the electrical differential.</s>
          <s>The EEG technique is one of the most studied non-invasive interfaces as it has a fine temporal resolution.</s>
          <s>The main advantages of EEG lie in the relatively low setup price, possibility of portability and relative ease of use.</s>
          <s>Among the main drawbacks of EEG is the quality of spatial resolution that tends to be poor.</s>
          <s>With scalp EEG, the activity recorded by one channel corresponds to the averaged activity of millions of neurons.</s>
          <s>Only certain types of activity in the superficial layers of the brain can be measured and the amplitude of the electrical activity is in the microvolts.</s>
          <s>The signal measure for each channel is hooked to an amplifier that amplifies the signals 1000 to 100,000 fold.</s>
          <s>In a digital acquisition system the analog signal is digitized and typically sampled at a rate of 256 to 512 Hz and then filtered to remove undesirable frequencies (high frequencies correspond to motor noise, low frequencies contain artifacts from heart activity, 50-60Hz signals correspond to artifacts at the frequency of alternative current, the artifacts will be discussed later in the section).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).</s>
          <s>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique to visualize internal structures of the brain through nuclear magnetic resonance.</s>
          <s>Functional MRI (fMRI) is a type of MRI scan that measures the hemodynamic response (change in the ratio of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) related to neural activity in the brain <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A limitation of this approach is that it has a low temporal resolution (up to 8 seconds) because the inflow of blood is not an immediate phenomenon.</s>
          <s>The development of real time fMRI has allowed fMRI to be used to build BCI systems and to produce neurofeedback, the latter being the more popular application given the low temporal resolution of fMRI.</s>
          <s>We refer the reader to <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> for an exhaustive review of fMRI applications to BCIs and neurofeedback.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).</s>
          <s>fNIRS measures the relative concentration of oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin by emitting near-infrared photos from an emitter placed on the skull and by measuring the spectrum shift of the photons that cross through a few centimeters away.</s>
          <s>Compared to other modalities that measure blood oxygenation levels (fMRI), fNIRS has a relatively higher temporal resolution (10Hz vs. 0.5Hz for fMRI).</s>
          <s>Thus fNIRS allows building BCIs with a reasonable latency between the stimulation onset and the classification output.</s>
          <s>Moreover, another advantage is that fNIRS is not affected by artifacts from muscle activity and allows to produce BCIs that function in an ambulatory setting <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>All these advantages and the development of portable fNIRS sensors have prompted significant recent work on developing fNIRS BCIs, especially in HCI, where the ability to move is essential.</s>
          <s>However, fNIRS is also limited: it has a shallow penetration of no more than 2 cm on average and it is affected by skull thickness and noise from the activity of the vascular system.</s>
          <s>Thus, fNIRS BCIs also suffer from signal to noise ratio problems.</s>

        <head>Magnetoencephalography (MEG).</head>
        <p>
          <s>Magnetoencephalography or MEG captures brain activity through measurements of the magnetic fields created by the natural electric currents generated in the brain through sensitive magnetometers <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most common types of sensors are called Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID) as they are extremely compact and allow the reduction of the size of the acquisition devices.</s>
          <s>The brain generates the magnetic fields that are very faint compared to ambient electromagnetic fields and thus shielding is critical.</s>
          <s>Although sensors are compact, the shielding requires large enclosing bodies and requires users' heads to be immobile (although movement elsewhere is not an issue).</s>
          <s>MEG has a greater spatial resolution than EEG and promises to offer high temporal resolutions (~1ms per sample).</s>
          <s>MEG is mostly used to study neurocognitive phenomena (e.g. the study of feature processing <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , but successful BCIs have been developed as well <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Positron Emission Tomography (PET).</s>
          <s>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measures the spatial distribution and movement of a radioactive chemical ("tracer") injected into the tissue of a human.</s>
          <s>PET scans are expensive (see <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Another disadvantage for using PET lies in the fact that it involves injection of a radioactive material into the blood.</s>
          <s>The other problem is that although PET, similarly to fMRI has excellent spatial resolution, the delay between the shift in activity and the resulting change in blood flow is between 6 and 9 seconds (one can interpret where the event occurred but not be sure of exactly when it occurred, which makes statements about the relative order of activations problematic) <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Summary of the state of the art on acquisition techniques for BCIs</head>
        <p>
          <s>As we can conclude from <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> , that wraps up this subsection, 3/5 neuroimaging tools described in this section, place restrictions on the user, PET, MEG and FMRI require sitting/ laying down in the scanner, which may not be realistic for some human-computer interaction settings.</s>
          <s>Most of these acquisition tools are quite expensive, and not portable, which also limits the interaction and may not be suited for some HCI applications (depends on the context of use).</s>
          <s>In our work we will mainly focus on the description of EEG-based BCI systems as the most affordable ones for most research labs and centers nowadays.</s>

        <head>Abstraction Level 2: Aspects related to signal processing and classification</head>
        <p>
          <s>Why this subsection is interesting for HCI researchers?</s>
          <s>In this subsection we explain, that in BCIs the commands are not always issued by the person at his/her will, but are very often system-paced, e.g., imposed by the system.</s>
          <s>This property of BCIs may require particular design choices when proposing an interaction based on BCIs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Classification of brain states.</s>
          <s>Brain signals are very variable both between people and within a single person.</s>
          <s>This is due to the low spatial resolution of scalp EEG and to the fact that the measurement of EEG is indirect.</s>
          <s>This means that averaging is required to obtain reliable measurements, which in turn slows down the speed at which EEG can be processed and used to detect phenomena and results in a low bitrate.</s>
          <s>The bitrate represents the amount of information transmitted by the BCI per minute.</s>
          <s>In most cases this is the number of actions performed per minute.</s>
          <s>The person, who wants to use a BCI-based system should be trained to produce the stable brain patterns The more training the user undergoes or the more training trials are captured, the faster the detection can be made <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This training can require hours and days of repetitive practice.</s>
          <s>Nowadays, we distinguish synchronous and asynchronous systems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In synchronous (or system-paced) BCIs the commands are imposed by the system.</s>
          <s>These systems include two stages.</s>
          <s>First stage requires the subject to perform mental tasks (e.g.</s>
          <s>imagination of tongue movement), in order for the system to collect a sufficient amount of supervised data.</s>
          <s>At this stage no feedback is provided to the user.</s>
          <s>The acquired data is processed offline, and allows defining features, classifiers and their parameters.</s>
          <s>Once the classification accuracy is sufficient from the offline learning, a second, supervised stage is proposed: the user is cued on the tasks to perform and now receives feedback on the result of the classification.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In contrast, in asynchronous (self-paced) BCIs the commands are issued at any time whenever the user decides.</s>
          <s>This helps in achieving real-time systems <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , though the training examples are also required for these systems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Still, the synchronous setting remains common, as the performance of such BCIs can easily be evaluated, thus making this setting desirable for experiments and for comparing system in an in-the-lab setting.</s>
          <s>Moreover, a continuous classification (required for asynchronous systems) greatly increases the computational requirements towards achieving a real-time BCI system.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Training in BCIs takes from 10 minutes to several hours (at most).</s>
          <s>However, compared to the inexistent training required for tactile tablets or keyboard based interactions, training a BCI system is a tedious process.</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the main differences between the presented machine learning approaches: synchronous and asynchronous.</s>
          <s>Although the synchronous BCI systems are easier to design and evaluate, they offer less degrees of freedom to the user due to their cue-based nature.</s>

        <p>
          <s>1. Event related de/synchronization (ERD/ERS) indicates changes in rhythmic activity of the brain, often within 8-12 Hz.</s>
          <s>These changes are observed over primary sensory or motor cortical areas.</s>
          <s>The synchronization (ERS, increase in brain rhythm) occurs while processing sensory information or producing motor output.</s>
          <s>The desynchronization (ERD, decrease in brain rhythm) occurs while performing the movements, movement (motor) imagery or movement preparation.</s>
          <s>Motor imagery (MI) is one of the well studied paradigms used in BCI applications nowadays.</s>
          <s>During MI the user imagines moving various body parts, e.g.</s>

          <s>Actual motor activity is not necessary, merely imagining or mentally rehearsing a motor activity generates similar activations as real movement.</s>
          <s>This makes paradigms such as MI possible.</s>
          <s>The location of the activations depends on the limb involved in the motor activity or imagined motor activity, given that each limb is mapped to a different location of the sensory motor cortex.</s>

          <s>In general, event related potentials are either positive or negative (positive or negative amplitude of the potential).</s>
          <s>The name given to ERPs often starts by P or N depending on whether they are positive or negative, followed by a number in milliseconds that characterizes how much time the potential appears after the stimulus.</s>

          <s>ERNs are often used to produce adaptive BCI systems that can detect when the user perceives a classification error and adapt the classifier in accordance <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>

          <s>When the user consciously produces a mental action, the input is considered as being explicit.</s>

        <head>Evaluation of conceptual space</head>
        <p>
          <s>In order to evaluate our conceptual space, we consider the three dimensions proposed by <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[62]</ref> to evaluate a design space:</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1. descriptive power: "the ability of the design space to describe a significant range of existing interfaces"; 2. evaluative power: "the ability of the design space to help assess multiple design alternatives"; 3. generative power: "the ability of the design space to help designers create new designs".</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The fullness of the conceptual space cannot be definitely proven, but we propose two solutions that facilitate the description and evaluation of our conceptual space.</s>
          <s>First of all, we have chosen one system from each of eight applicative domains presented in section "Abstraction Level 4" of this paper, in order to address the descriptive power of our conceptual space.</s>
          <s>We then have chosen to zoom into two of the domains in more depth and describe 32 state of the art systems coming from two applicative groups: house control and games.</s>
          <s>For our gaming analysis we inspired ourselves with the table from chapter 10 of <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[65]</ref> , where 37 games based on BCIs are classified regarding which paradigm was used, which type of sensors, how many commands were achieved and with which level of accuracy.</s>
          <s>The authors point out that "due to differences in the number of classes and trial lengths, these accuracies cannot be used to compare individual studies".</s>
          <s>As for the second solution, it could be complicated to find some unexplored zone in our conceptual space, when more systems will be added; as well as classification and evaluation of the new systems that would be added to the conceptual space may not be an easy task.</s>
          <s>In order to facilitate the usage of our conceptual space, we will propose an interactive webpage, where we describe the functionalities of our conceptual space, and where the other researchers will be capable to add the new systems or visualize the systems they would like to compare.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, the generative power of our conceptual space will be discussed in details in the following section, with the conception and experimental evaluation of the two new interaction systems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To illustrate the descriptive power of our conceptual space, we will now project several existing BCI systems in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7. <ref target="#tab_2" type="table">Table 4</ref> includes the systems from the 8 applicative domains we described in Section "Abstraction Level 4" of this paper.</s>
          <s>We take one system from each application domain and project it in our conceptual space in order to address the descriptive power of our conceptual space.</s>
          <s>We then have chosen to take the BCI systems within two domains (home control, <ref target="#tab_5" type="table">Table 5</ref> ; and gaming, Tables 6 and 7) in order to check, if some tendencies could be seen if the systems are analyzed via one domain.</s>
          <s>The cross ("X") in the tables indicates the presence of the feature.</s>
          <s>Each axis could contain as many features as there are in each of the projected systems.</s>
          <s>For example, if we consider an SSVEP-ERD system of <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[75]</ref> , where alpha-ERD is used to change avatar speed while SSVEP is used to destroy the enemy, we will select ERD and SSEP in "Neural mechanism axis".</s>

          <s>John, a PhD student in HCI would like to see some generic tools of the existing BCI systems.</s>
          <s>Although some domains concerned by BCIs such as signal processing, propose the state of the art papers about the classification algorithms like <ref target="#b86" type="bibr">[99,</ref>
            <ref target="#b87" type="bibr">100]</ref> , no works exist to the general classification of BCI systems.</s>
          <s>By using our tool, John gets a starting point of the list of the BCI systems.</s>
          <s>After reading the proposed references, John forgets some details or does not see any particular difference between some systems, but our conceptual space helps him to see all the systems at a glance.</s>
          <s>The supervisors of John work in ambient intelligence and suggest him to investigate the works related to home control, as the PhD of John is made in partnership with a company, working on smart sensors for the apartments.</s>
          <s>John selects two works of <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[78]</ref> and <ref target="#b66" type="bibr">[79]</ref> suitable for his project.</s>
          <s>He wants to further investigate the main difference between the works of <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[78]</ref> and <ref target="#b66" type="bibr">[79]</ref> , and he discovers that Edlinger et al. are using 2 types of BCI systems, otherwise the systems are very similar, and John finds the implementation of Edlinger more beneficial, as it uses 2 types of BCIs and its pragmatism is close to direct.</s>
          <s>Scenario 2: Creating a new system.</s>
          <s>Jane, an HCI researcher, decided to explore the usage of BCIs.</s>
          <s>Using our conceptual space, she is able to find the unexplored zones in it.</s>
          <s>It shows her that there are not a lot of systems that apply BCIs in physical space, and no system actually proposes a mixed interaction.</s>
          <s>Jane considers that it could be of interest, as nowadays BCIs are still considered as additional interaction techniques that are not reliable enough to be used for critical control, and using BCIs to provide some additional information in an augmented reality is potentially an application to be tested.</s>
          <s>If Jane wants to move on, by checking the adaptive interfaces, she will be able to notice, that no system is proposed today that uses syntactic future changes.</s>
          <s>Moreover, in HCI, adaptation to the user needs is an important property for some systems.</s>
          <s>She checks the reference of the study that initially proposed the theoretical concept of this approach and considers the further investigation of this axis in her own study.</s>

          <s>In order to further validate our conceptual space, we performed a focus study with 8 HCI researchers, who all has 5+ years of research experience and publishing in top HCI journals and conferences.</s>

            <ref target="#tab_5" type="table">Tables 5 to 8</ref> and to come up with a new system for BCIs that would fill in the gap and preferentially would build on previous, existing works and systems.</s>
          <s>The researchers focused on the smart home applications and they proposed a new system based on <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[76]</ref> with the following reasoning: "we have already known that BCIs are error-prone systems but using the proposed conceptual space we have discovered that a lot of works couple BCIs with gaze tracking.</s>
          <s>As we focused on smart home applications, we have found out that <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[76]</ref> uses gaze to select an object in the house to be controlled, and then suggests imagining an action to be performed with an object.</s>
          <s>We were intrigued that no other system uses gaze and a "simpler" to be trained BCI, like SSEP.</s>
          <s>Although flickering might not be the most pleasant interaction, it seems to be a more robust way of communication based on BCIs than using ERD/ERS.</s>
          <s>Moreover, in the use case of the home control, there are tens of objects to be controlled and thus SSEP will be easier to control and to use than ERD/ERS".</s>

        <head>General discussion and limitations of conceptual space</head>
        <p>
          <s>The analysis of the conceptual space by representing 32 BCI systems reveals several interesting facts: the majority of the systems are applied and used in virtual (numerical space), most of the systems use ERD/ERS as neural paradigm, and in most of the cases the user needs to wait the system trigger to start any mental activity.</s>
          <s>ERD/ERS as neural paradigm.</s>
          <s>This is an interesting finding, as ERP/SSEP paradigms tend to show almost no training needed and it is possible to achieve 100% accuracy with those.</s>
          <s>This finding could be explained by the convenience of use of ERD/ERS paradigms, as they do not require any additional stimuli in the environment to be measured.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The system trigger.</s>
          <s>BCIs that use system triggers, only takes into consideration the brain activity during predefined time windows.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the user can manipulate the system only during these predefined time windows.</s>
          <s>The advantage of such BCI systems is in their relative robustness, as the system knows in advance the type of activity to be expected from the user and the precise moment of time this activity could happen.</s>
          <s>This simplifies the design and evaluation of such systems.</s>
          <s>These systems are computationally less demanding and complex, but they are also restricting the interaction between the user and the system.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>More generally, there are some tendencies within the sub-axes.</s>
          <s>For example, if we choose the "Interaction Task" we can see the clear difference for each of the tables: the most common tasks for smart homes are "on/off", "position" and "select"; for the games-"path", "orient".</s>
          <s>These trends exist through the whole conceptual space within each axis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition to these main observations, the conceptual space could be used as a tool to understand intrinsic differences even among very similar systems such as, for example, between <ref target="#b69" type="bibr">[82]</ref> and <ref target="#b70" type="bibr">[83]</ref> which both look very similar at the first sight but one system uses hybrid interaction and not the other one.</s>
          <s>Moreover, as we can notice, in the case of smart home control, several systems use hybrid interaction in conjunction with the BCIs mostly for selection task, which is not the case for the gaming domain, where almost no systems use hybrid interaction in conjunction with the BCIs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The conceptual space proposes a first state of the art classification framework, where each system is represented with the respect of already existing BCI taxonomies but also applying the HCI considerations to the input devices.</s>
          <s>Typically, reference BCI taxonomies such as [56] do not consider the command initiative (cf.</s>
          <s>user-triggered or system-triggered), nor do they cover the interaction space (physical or virtual).</s>
          <s>The proposed approach allows the classification of a wider range of interaction techniques that could be presented in future.</s>
          <s>Moreover, it considers a fine grain analysis of the implemented user control (cf. the decision about the command, command initiative and pragmatic axes) allowing the unique integration of original interaction techniques such as the one proposed by ourselves to show the generative power of the conceptual space.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The conceptual space can be also used as a framework for decision making about new applications.</s>
          <s>For example, by proposing an application, that uses a new neural paradigm for the tasks from Foley's taxonomy while designing an application, the researchers will be able to test a new user experience with BCI.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We tried to include the axes that span across different levels of descriptions and come from different fields of expertise (BCI and HCI), as we consider that it actually provides the framework to merge the expertise of two different areas and to help in thinking "outside of the box".</s>
          <s>We would like to point out, that also we grouped the 9 sub-axes into 4 axes, they could be seen as separate dimensions, as the importance of the axes and sub-axes depends on the end user of the framework (e.g. a BCI researcher or a HCI researcher) and on the aim of using the tool at first place (descriptive of the state of the art, or generative of new lines of research).</s>
          <s>As an example, we would like to cite one of the experts of the domain who reviewed our conceptual space: "for a BCI expert the sub-axis "Representation Space" might not be as important as the sub-axis "Interface Adaptation".</s>
          <s>For a BCI developer/programmer, it might indeed be less important to know if the considered system is used for controlling a real-world object (e.g. a flying drone) or a virtual object (e.g. a cursor on the screen), as a BCI researcher might be rather interested in developing/optimizing the underlying algorithm for recognition of the different mental states, which would control the object independently of its nature.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, it might be more important for the same BCI researcher to classify the type of adaptation (i.e. the categorization "semantic" or "syntactic", with "immediate" or "future changes"), to propose new adapting schemes not imagined before".</s>
          <s>The current paper does not take into account or explore by any mean the training and feedback in BCIs as there is a design space already published which tackle these aspects of BCI systems <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our conceptual space the "classical" taxonomies for input devices in HCI have been used as a basis to provide researchers and designers from HCI with an overview of BCIs close to the one of the "classical" GUIs.</s>

        <head>Future work: Towards a conceptual space for any BCI applications?</head>
        <p>
          <s>Our conceptual space only takes into account EEG as an acquisition technique for BCI applications.</s>
          <s>But as we presented in section "Abstraction Level 1: Signal Acquisition" of this paper, we distinguish 5 more acquisition techniques that are mainly used nowadays: (f)NIRS, (f)MRI, ECoG, PET and MEG.</s>
          <s>We hypothesize that it could be possible to include the other acquisition methods as well.</s>
          <s>For instance, given that the phenomena measured by EEG and MEG are the same, the study of ERPs is similar, and thus we do not need to make any particular modifications in our conceptual space.</s>
          <s>We analyzed 9 papers from CHI proceedings and presented the results in <ref target="#tab_8" type="table">Table 8</ref> , where the acquisition techniques that are often presented include fNIRS.</s>
          <s>For this we added "Acquisition Axis" to our conceptual space, and we did not do any further modifications to our conceptual space.</s>
          <s>We highlight the new axes in dark grey color.</s>
          <s>We have chosen CHI conference, as this work aims on facilitating the accessibility of BCIs for HCI at the first place.</s>
          <s>As we can see after projecting these studies on our conceptual space, for the papers published at CHI, there is a clear tendency towards the systems that use interface adaptation, so the mental activity that is demanded from the user is implicit.</s>

          <s>Going further, as we have mentioned in section 2.1.3</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Nowadays, the adoption of BCIs as an input modality is still quite moderate aside from more « proof-of-concept » applications.</s>
          <s>We argue that it is in part related to the fact that the BCIs and its commands are not self-revealing: both users and designers should know which commands are available and how to trigger them.</s>
          <s>There is currently a gap as no design space on BCIs exists that would help the users, designers and researchers to better understand, compare and reason about the appropriate solutions the BCIs could provide to them.</s>
          <s>The challenge is to propose a design space, which would be simple to use by the researchers and users who may not be familiar with the full state of the art on BCIs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this paper we proposed a novel conceptual space that describes the EEG-based BCI systems.</s>
          <s>Our conceptual space contains 4 axes which represent 4 questions: When (temporal aspects), What (content aspects), How (medium aspects) and Where (spatial aspects).</s>
          <s>These 4 axes contain 9 sub-axes.</s>
          <s>The conceptual space consists of 41 options in total as well as their different combinations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The analysis of the conceptual space by representing 32 existing BCI systems revealed several interesting facts: the majority of the systems are applied and used in virtual environment, most of the systems use ERD/ERS as neural paradigm, and in most of the cases the user needs to wait the system trigger to start any mental activity.</s>
          <s>In addition to these main observations, the conceptual space could be used as a tool to understand intrinsic differences even among very similar systems.</s>
          <s>The conceptual space can be also used as a framework for decision making about new applications.</s>
          <s>Although our conceptual space is built around EEG-based BCIs, we further demonstrated a possibility to generalize our conceptual space to cover other acquisition techniques like fNIRS.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Brain-Computer Interfaces have received much attention over the last years.</s>
          <s>We believe this is because, at core, they are leaving the labs, and taking steps into the "real" world.</s>
          <s>We hope that our conceptual space will encourage the development of novel BCI applications, and make the fusion between BCIs and HCI more fluid.</s>

Usually referred to as yes/no communication, one of the first applications where BCIs were used. A famous example is a system called "Right Justified Box", in which motor imagery was used to choose one of two targets [35].</figDesc>

        <figDesc>Manipulating. In this category of applications we refer to the applications that are used to directly manipulate (change speed, send a command to turn left) the virtual and/or physical objects, e.g. moving forward a wheelchair, selecting an item in a video game and so on. Here are two examples: A. Real robot piloting task. From [38]. A user is able to control a real robot drone by perform- ing mentally the following tasks: rising it up by imagining both hands movement; going down by imagining both feet movement and so on. The system achieved around 95% accu- racy after 2 months training period. Other examples of robot control include [39].</figDesc>
