          <head>UVR8 (UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8) is a UV-B photoreceptor responsible for initiating UV-B signalling in plants. UVR8 is a homodimer in its signalling inactive form. Upon absorption of UV radiation, the protein monomerizes into its photoactivated state. In the monomeric form, UVR8 binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 (CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1), triggering subsequent UV-B-dependent photomorphogenic development in plants. Recent in vivo experiments have shown</head>
          <p>
            <s>that the UVR8 C-terminal region (aa 397-423; UVR8 C27 ) alone is sufficient to regulate the activity of COP1.</s>
            <s>In this work, CD spectroscopy and NMR experiments showed that the UVR8 C27 domain was non-structured but gained secondary structure at higher temperatures leading to increased order.</s>
            <s>Bias-exchange metadynamics simulations were also performed to evaluate the free energy landscape of UVR8 C27 .</s>
            <s>An inverted free energy landscape was revealed, with a disordered structure in the global energy minimum.</s>
            <s>Flanking the global energy minimum, more structured states were found at higher energies.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, stabilization of the low energy disordered state was attributed to a proline residue, P411, as evident from P411A mutant data.</s>
            <s>P411 is also a key residue in UVR8 binding to COP1.</s>
            <s>UVR8 C27 is therefore structurally competent to function as a molecular switch for interaction of UVR8 with different binding partners since at higher free energies different structural conformations are being induced in this peptide.</s>
            <s>P411 has a key role for this function.</s>

            <s>Although UV-B (280-315 nm) is only a small fraction of the total solar radiation at the earth's surface, it has a significant impact on life on our planet.</s>
            <s>In plants, UV-B serves as an inducer, evoking critical physiological responses ranging from photomorphogenesis and photoprotection to circadian rhythms.</s>
            <s>This includes both molecular and intracellular changes 1-4 , such as induction of expression of at least 100 different genes, the accumulation of flavonoid-derived pigments 5 and antioxidants, DNA repair, as well as alteration of plant morphology 6 .</s>

            <s>UVR8 exists as a homodimer in the absence of UV-B.</s>
            <s>It is only upon the absorption of UV-B radiation that UVR8 monomerizes and is activated as a signalling molecule 7 and tryptophan residues of the Trp-rich UVR8 polypeptide have been shown to be chromophores for the UV-B absorption 7,8 .</s>
            <s>It has been shown that closely stacked tryptophan residues W285, W233, and W337, located at the interface of the UVR8 dimer, are responsible for the perception of UV-B radiation 9,10 .</s>

            <s>Most likely, a proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction triggered by the UV-B absorption results in the neutralization and breakage of some essential interfacial salt-bridges, leading to the dissociation of the UVR8 dimer complex 11,12 .</s>

          <s>In fact, this peptide had to be removed before the UVR8 protein lent itself to crystallization.</s>

          <s>After absorption of UV quanta and monomerization of UVR8, UV-B signalling is further transmitted by the activated UVR8 monomer through its direct interaction with COP1 3 .</s>

            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, in a recent study by Yin et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> , the UVR8 C27 domain was shown to be sufficient on its own in mimicking the action of the full size UVR8 monomer with regards to its action on COP1, i.e. being able to modulate the activity of COP1 and downstream signalling in vivo, including HY5 expression.</s>
          <s>Thus, from a signalling point of view, the bulk of the UVR8 protein is not needed to accomplish further activity once it has formed the heterodimer together with COP1 and been transported into the nucleus.</s>
          <s>Instead, the UVR8 C27 peptide is now the active entity.</s>
          <s>In plants, the COP1 protein acts as a switching hub orchestrating several different light-induced developmental processes <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>

          <s>In the processes in Homo sapiens, interactions of COP1 with several other proteins are linked to a specific VP amino acid residue motif of the interaction partners <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previously, we have in fact also in plants shown <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> that UVR8 C27 , in addition to other COP1-binding proteins <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> , contains a conserved VP motif (V410 and P411).</s>
          <s>These two hydrophobic residues were later shown to be essential for the COP1 binding to occur <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>In summary, the functional aspects of COP1, such as its activities, and its interactions with different upstream and downstream components therefore is of broad scientific interest, from plant biology to medicine.</s>

          <s>The fact that the UVR8 C27 domain and the rest of the UVR8 protein are functionally distinct (i.e. the UVR8 C27 domain is not needed for the initial UV absorption and monomerization processes and UVR8 C27 is on its own sufficient for inducing downstream signalling through COP1; see above), we used the isolated UVR8 C27 peptide for these studies, which considerably simplifies procedures.</s>

          <s>Structural characterization of the UVR8 C27 domain.</s>
          <s>UVR8 is in its inactivated homodimer form not able to bind COP1.</s>
          <s>Upon absorption of UV radiation, the UVR8 homodimer undergoes conformational rearrangements that ultimately lead to dimer disruption and formation of activated UVR8 monomers.</s>
          <s>In its monomeric state, UVR8 is able to initiate UV-signalling through the interaction of the UVR8 C27 domain with COP1.</s>
          <s>Upon return to dark conditions, COP1 is replaced by a RUP monomer and the inactivated UVR8 homodimer is later re-established.</s>
          <s>These sequential monomerization/dimerization events can most likely be explained by the conformation/availability of the UVR8 C-terminus for binding to the different interaction partners (COP1, RUP1/2, or a second UVR8), and how the UVR8 C27 domain is structurally rearranged during these different states.</s>
          <s>In this paper, a structural and dynamic characterization of this domain was performed to ascertain the functional role of UVR8 C27 , including the implications this has for modulation of the interactions with COP1 and the RUPs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As a first step in the pursuit of understanding this complex sequence of events, we focused our attention to the UVR8 C27 peptide and characterized this domain by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.</s>
          <s>Since protein interactions are strongly coupled to the structure of the interacting partners, it was highly desirable to establish the structural behaviour of the UVR8 C27 domain.</s>
          <s>The capability of UVR8 C27 to specifically interact with several different interactions partners suggests the presence of different conformations of the peptide.</s>
          <s>Thus, by probing its structural changes using far-UV CD with increasing temperatures, clues to such conformations could potentially be obtained.</s>
          <s>Increases in temperature is one way of increasing the free energy of the peptide.</s>
          <s>This high energy state may mimic the structural precursor of UVR8 C27 that is involved in establishing the "encounter complex" formed between the peptide and a possible interactive protein (e.g.</s>
          <s>COP1).</s>
          <s>Our measurements showed characteristic intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)-like features for the UVR8 C27 peptide, with a strong negative peak at 198 nm and a negative shoulder around 220 nm <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1A)</ref> .</s>
          <s>A gradually more shallow negative peak at 198 nm and a more pronounced negative shoulder around 220 nm was found at increasing temperatures (10-98 °C), <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1A</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, a slight but distinct shift towards longer wavelengths for the negative peak around 198 nm occurred.</s>
          <s>As indicated by the difference spectrum <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref> , spectral features consisting of a strong positive peak around 193 nm and a broad negative dip around 223 nm were gradually obtained with increasing temperature.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the difference spectrum is consistent with a gain in β-sheet structure as the temperature increased.</s>
          <s>However, it is not possible to rule out the presence of other structural elements due to regional overlap.</s>
          <s>It is worth noting that the characteristic IDP spectrum recorded at 10 °C could be fully recovered after thermal annealing, thus excluding any tendency of aggregation of the UVR8 C27 domain at high temperatures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A single isodichroic point at 209 nm could be observed for UVR8 C27 during the temperature scan.</s>
          <s>Reconstructions of data sets recorded at 10 °C and 98 °C <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1C,D)</ref> show the distribution of secondary structure elements of the UVR8 C27 peptide.</s>
          <s>The average measured secondary structures are 3% α-helix, 9% β-strand, 6% turns and 82% disordered structure at 10 °C, and 6% α-helix, 15% β-strand, 11% turns, and 67% disordered structure at 98 °C (SI Appendix, <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The largest structural changes were observed in the content of β-structure, increasing from 9 to 15%.</s>
          <s>This is also evident from the difference spectrum <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The second largest change is observed in turns increasing from 6 to 11%.</s>
          <s>The α-helix content doubled from 3 to 6%.</s>
          <s>Our data imply that, as the temperature is raised (i.e. as the free energy of the peptide increases), the disordered peptide transiently access conformations containing ordered secondary structure.</s>

          <s>From this spectrum it is obvious that all 24 backbone NH-groups (not counting prolines and the N-terminal residue) can be found within the same narrow spectral window (8.6 ppm-7.7 ppm) in the 1 H-dimension.</s>

          <s>However, we are also aware that, in addition to attaining a PPII structure in the VP motif, it is difficult to separate such a secondary structure from the fact that the proline may provide extensive contacts with the C27 binding site on COP1 that would be difficult for other amino acids to replicate.</s>

          <s>Interestingly, since both the low energy and the high energy states are represented by ensembles of many conformations, the single isodichroic point noted in CD experiments and supported by metadynamics simulations, indicate that UVR8 C27 may readily switch between the more structured high energy conformations via the disordered global energy minima.</s>

          <s>Previous data on the relationship between dimer dissociation and exposure of the C-terminus of UVR8 is somewhat equivocal and two hypotheses have been proposed: first, the UVR8 C-terminus may be located distal to the interaction surface of the UVR8 dimer, as suggested by small angle X-ray scattering data 10 ; secondly, a β-sheet structure of the C-terminus may be formed by interaction with the UVR8 N-terminus as indicated by analysing the UVR8 sequence using Weblogo <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, our present study shows that the UVR8 C-terminal domain is highly tuneable to its surrounding environment.</s>
          <s>Hence, it is very likely that the C-terminus exists in different conformations in the hidden and the exposed states, and when binding to the different interaction partners (COP1 or RUPs).</s>
          <s>We thus suggest that upon absorption of UV radiation, the UVR8 homodimer dissociates and the C-termini that are exposed to solution are in their non-structured unrestricted states, but in thermal equilibrium with more ordered high energy conformations that facilitate binding to the COP1 WD40 domain.</s>
          <s>Through the UVR8 interaction with COP1, the transcription factor HY5 is protected from COP1-dependent degradation and is thus able to induce downstream expression of UVR8-responsive genes (including RUP1/2 gene expression <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Down-regulation of the UV response is thereby induced by the newly synthesized RUPs as they interact with the UVR8 monomer C-termini, most likely at higher affinity than that of COP1, subsequently "tuning" the UVR8 C-termini to a specific structure that promotes the reassembly of the UVR8 homodimer complex.</s>
