          <s>Optimal expansion of NHBE cells was achieved with PneumaCult-Ex Plus (M3) or BEGM (M1) medium with ROCK inhibitor.</s>
          <s>Primary NHBE cells were originally expanded in three different growth media at passage one -BEGM (M1), PneumaCult-Ex (M2) or PneumaCult-Ex Plus (M3) ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1 and Fig. S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Cells readily proliferated; however, it was noticeable that cells grown in M3 medium appeared to form typical cobble stone-shaped clustered 'colonies' , contributing to a higher density of cells when reaching 70-80% confluency <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. S2A,B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>From passage two, NHBE cells were either expanded in media alone, or with the addition of ROCK inhibitor or 3T3 Swiss albino feeder cells (3T3).</s>
          <s>ROCK inhibitor and 3T3 feeder cells were only tested with M1 and M2 media.</s>
          <s>We chose to only test the ability of M3 medium to proliferate cells by itself since clustered colonies were observed in absence of 3T3 cells or ROCK inhibitor.</s>
          <s>NHBE cells grown in M2 media, or variations thereof, were only grown until passage four (P4) since it was already clear that M1 + ROCK and M3 were more proficient for cell growth and expansion.</s>
          <s>Beyond passage five (P5), NHBE cells were only grown in either M1 + ROCK or M3 media <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Various differences in proliferation emerged depending on the growth medium and the additional factors, for example NHBE cells proliferating in M1 medium appeared to excel with the addition of ROCK but not 3T3 feeder cells <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. S2A,B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>NHBE cells were expanded up to eight passages in M3 medium, whereas NHBE cells continued up to passage twelve in M1 + ROCK medium <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. S3A,B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the ability for these passaged NHBE cells to form 3D epithelial cultures needed to be determined.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Optimal differentiation of NHBE cells was achieved from PneumaCult-Ex Plus (M3) grown cells.</s>
          <s>Despite successful growth of NHBE cells in M1 + ROCK, M2 or M3 media, the ability for the cells to differentiate into 3D epithelial cultures was best achieved with growth-expansion M3 medium prior to culturing at ALI in PneumaCult-ALI (ALI) medium for 4 weeks <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Histology of the 3D cultures demonstrated that M1 + ROCK and M2 media only resulted in a 2-3 multi-layered epithelium with sparse differentiated cells within 4 weeks ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Cells grown in M2 medium eventually formed a thicker epithelium with differentiated cells when time at ALI was extended to 8 weeks <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. S4</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, cells grown from M3 medium differentiated into goblet and ciliated cells, forming a thick 4-6 multi-layered epithelium within 4 weeks at ALI. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which is a strong indicator of epithelium integrity, indicated the polarization of cells grown from M3 but not M1 + ROCK nor M2 media <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2B</ref> ).</s>
          <s>M3 medium was therefore used to expand NHBE cells from three different donors <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3A,B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>From passage two to six, cells reached about 75% confluence in less than 6 days per passage.</s>
          <s>After passage six, the number of days to reach confluence increased, indicative of a decline in cell growth <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Overall, primary NHBE cells could be cultured up to 8 times within 30 days for most donors <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3B</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We next evaluated the effect of cell density on 3D cultures prior to ALI (M3 growth medium used for seeding cells).</s>
          <s>Optimal seeding density of cells onto transwells was determined at 50,000 cells/well in M3 growth medium ( <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. S5B</ref> ).</s>
          <s>At higher seeding densities (100,000 cells/well), very thick epithelial layers were formed <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. S5A)</ref> , possibly due to overcrowding of cells in transwell.</s>
          <s>Lower seeding densities (25,000 cells/well) could still form epithelial layers, although epithelial multilayer was only 2-3 cells thick <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. S5C</ref> ).</s>

          <s>Pseudostratified, fully differentiated epithelial layers were formed within 4 weeks from NHBE cells passaged up to 4 times from three different donors.</s>
          <s>Beyond passage four, the epithelial layers began to lose their columnar ciliated cell structure in most of the donors despite presence of cilia and goblet cells.</s>
          <s>3D epithelial cultures could still be grown from passage eight NHBE cells from one donor (Donor A) but not the other 2 donors.</s>

          <s>However, significant declines in TEER were observed for 3D cultures grown from these NHBE cells expanded beyond passage six.</s>

        <p>
          <s>For the first time, this study demonstrates that normal epithelial phenotypic characteristics are maintained in passaged primary NHBE cells, including crucial CFTR ion channel function.</s>
          <s>The ability to expand primary NHBE cells and form 3D epithelia for in vitro models is an important factor that can be implemented to a wide range of airway epithelial studies.</s>
          <s>In addition, we were able to compare different conditions to expand primary human airway cells and found that PneumaCult-Ex Plus (M3) medium did not require presence of feeder cells or ROCK inhibitor.</s>
          <s>Currently, in in vitro studies, passage one primary NHBE cells pose a limitation on resources and study design.</s>
          <s>Beyond passage one, primary cells begin to lose differentiation capabilities (ciliated and goblet cells) and fail to form 3D cultures.</s>
          <s>However, the ability to expand primary cells that can still form fully differentiated epithelium comparable to passage one cultures enables supplementary research that can be conducted for disease modeling, drug discovery and development of robust airway epithelial models from patients where samples are difficult or limited, such as infants/neonates and diseased patients <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>The use of primary human cells as an in vitro/organotypic model increases the predictability of cellular responses to pollutants and onset of disease (e.g.</s>
          <s>COPD, CF), as well as drug efficacy and toxicity before moving into clinical trials <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
          <s>By comparing three different expansion media conditions, we identified that PneumaCult-Ex Plus (M3 medium) gave the best conditions for expanding primary human bronchial epithelial cells which retained differentiation properties when grown at ALI.</s>
          <s>Primary NHBE cells could be passaged up to 7-12 times (within 30 days) with M1 + ROCK or M3 before significant declines in growth was observed.</s>
          <s>Fully differentiated epithelial layers were consistently grown from cells passaged up to four times from 3 different donors (4 weeks ALI in PneumaCult-ALI differentiation medium).</s>
          <s>Crucial phenotypic and functional characteristics were maintained in the epithelial layers derived from passaged cells, including TEER &gt; 400 Ohms.cm 2 , presence of ciliated and goblet cells, as well as CFTR function, ASL, and CBF similar to passage one.</s>
          <s>These endpoints are crucial factors in experimental design and investigating variability, particularly when studying the airway epithelium in vitro.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The added benefits of using Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCK) and mitotically inactivated 3T3-J2 feeder cells have been observed in another study when expanding sufficient numbers of primary tracheal airway cells for airway tissue engineering <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>They also observed and characterized the decline of cell growth and differentiation capability when passaging cells in BEGM medium only, indicating that the self-renewal capabilities begins to be lost after 1-2 passages.</s>
          <s>Another study similarly used ROCK and conditioned BEGM media from irradiated inactivated NIH-3T3 feeder cells to conditionally regulate pediatric cells, passaging cells up to 5-6 times over 30 days and maintaining robust immune responses in differentiated passage five cells <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, M3 medium (without addition of ROCK or 3T3 feeder cells) could similarly be used to expand primary human NHBE cells up to 7-9 passages in less than 30 days, further and faster than other published findings thus far.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this study, 3D cultures were only achieved within 4 weeks at ALI from primary NHBE cells passaged in M3 medium (not M1 + ROCK medium).</s>
          <s>The M1 + ROCK medium grown NHBE cells may not have grown successfully at ALI due to the media change to PneumaCult-ALI (manufactured by a different company than BEGM).</s>
          <s>B-ALI medium (LONZA) was not commercially available due to a heavy backlog; hence, NHBE cells were only airlifted in PneumaCult-ALI medium.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately as of today, B-ALI is still not available.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Differences in the ability to grow 3D cultures were also observed between different donors; however, 3D cultures were optimally grown from cells up to passage six.</s>
          <s>Key differences between donors were observed in 3D cultures derived from NHBE cells beyond passage six, for example, donor A maintained the ability to form a pseudostratified epithelium with differentiated goblet and ciliated cells, optimal TEER and functioning CFTR ion channels ( <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Figs 5A,B and 7B</ref> ).</s>
          <s>On the other hand, donors B and C failed to form a pseudostratified epithelium with passage eight NHBE cells, indicating the variability between donors.</s>
          <s>It is therefore crucial to understand that different donors may retain variation in differentiation capabilities.</s>
          <s>However, importantly, epithelium integrity (TEER), ASL, CBF and cilia length did not significantly differ between passages one and six in 3D cultures among all three donors.</s>
          <s>CFTR ion channel function also remained stable.</s>
          <s>It is also theorized that various harvesting protocols and cryogenic storage of passage zero harvested donor cells will play an important factor in the success of using cells for expansion.</s>
          <s>These factors, such as cryogenic preservation media and cell harvesting protocols were not investigated in this study as the original focus was on characterizing the differentiated cells.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we have been able to observe a gradual disintegration of the airway epithelium grown from passaged cells beyond passage six, particularly with columnar epithelial structure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5A), cilia length (Fig. 8C</ref> ) and epithelial integrity <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5B)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This highlights the limitation of using higher passage number primary cells in in vitro models compared to cell-lines which can be technically passaged indefinitely <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, primary cells are <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> , 3D cultures in this study demonstrated an estimated 70-80% ciliated cells and 15-26% goblet cells (MUC5B and MUC5AC) <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. S6)</ref> .</s>

        <note type="other">optimal models to represent the native and original cells with their ability to differentiate into ciliated cells, goblet cells and club cells. Similar to what has been described in 'normal' lungs 1,</note>
        <p>
          <s>Although CFTR ion channels did not appear to significantly change in our 3D cultures from passaged cells, a significant decline in ENaC was observed beyond passage one.</s>
          <s>ENaC has been attributed to the pathology of cystic fibrosis (CF), and there has been suggestions that ENaC and CFTR are "functionally interrelated" due to the close proximities of these epithelial ion channels <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> .</s>
          <s>Impaired function of ENaC and CFTR can result in dehydration of the airway surface fluid, often seen in CF patients.</s>
          <s>We, however, have not detected a decline in airway surface fluid <ref target="#fig_7" type="figure">(Fig. 8A)</ref> but it could be due to the decrease in ENaC function as sodium hyper-absorption through ENaC has been reported in CF.</s>
          <s>In addition, ENaC has also been shown to be expressed on the cilia of the airway epithelium <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, we did not detect any change in CBF or ASL.</s>
          <s>Future studies will be required to determine whether the decline in ENaC function is due to decreased expression of ENaC subunits or reduced activation of ENaC channels from the surface of ciliated cells and/or in cilia since this channel is activated after cleavage of the Î± and Î³ subunits by proteases <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, depending on the experimental design it is important to determine whether passaged primary cells will affect certain aspects of the 3D cultures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Future investigations into the use of passaged primary human airway cells for airway-on-a-chip models as well as co-culture conditions may also be of interest <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, the combination of primary passaged cells and automated cultivation systems could further enhance the large-scale expansion of primary airway cells for high-throughput screenings <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>In conclusion, the phenotypic endpoints evaluated in this study are critical for the development of in vitro lung models.</s>
          <s>It is necessary to optimize and choose appropriate culture characteristics for consistent results.</s>
          <s>This study has demonstrated primary NHBE cells can be passaged up to 6-8 times, and that normal epithelial phenotypic characteristics are maintained in passaged primary NHBE cells up to passage four, including crucial CFTR ion channel function which is important for airway mucociliary clearance.</s>
