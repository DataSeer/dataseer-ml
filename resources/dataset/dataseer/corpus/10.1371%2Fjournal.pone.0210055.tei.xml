          <p>
            <s>Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer.</s>
            <s>However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide.</s>
            <s>We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria.</s>

          <head>Methods</head>
          <p>
            <s>The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual 4PS ) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor.</s>
            <s>Cohen's κ coefficient (κ) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual 4PS .</s>
            <s>The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (Qual BK ), maximal standardized uptake values (SUV max3.4 , SUV max2.5 ), relative change of SUV max between pre-and post-CRT FDG PET (ΔSUV max ), mean standardized uptake values (SUV mean ), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG).</s>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Results</head>
          <p>
            <s>Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual 4PS criterion was excellent (κ: 0.95).</s>
            <s>Except the Qual BK , SUV max2.5 , and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS).</s>
            <s>Multivariable analysis showed only Qual 4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables.</s>
            <s>The 2-year OS rates of Qual 4PS (-) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual 4PS (+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1%).</s>

          <head>Conclusions</head>
          <p>
            <s>The Qual 4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival.</s>
            <s>It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the 5-year survival rate rarely exceeds 40% <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Most patients with esophageal cancer have advanced disease at the initial diagnosis, and are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as the standard therapy <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A robust stratification of patient responses to CRT based on non-invasive tools has not yet been well developed.</s>
          <s>After neoadjuvant treatment, neither clinical parameters nor endoscopic ultrasonography or CT scans can reliably predict outcome.</s>
          <s>The post-CRT FDG PET, however, has emerged as a promising predictor of long-term survival, and it can be used to tailor individualized treatment for poor responders after neoadjuvant treatment <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Patients whose FDG PET results were a complete response might not benefit from added resection given their excellent outcomes without resection <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One study <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> reported that the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for a complete metabolic response (CMR) versus no response for OS was 0.51 (95% confidence interval <ref type="bibr">[CI]</ref> , 0.40-0.64)</s>
          <s>and for disease-free survival was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.38-0.57),</s>
          <s>respectively.</s>
          <s>Despite its utility for predicting outcomes, the lack of uniform and reliable criteria for post-CRT FDG PET interpretation appears to be the major drawback to using the reported criteria universally.</s>
          <s>Methods to improve the predictive value of PET include a qualitative approach, e.g., comparing the tumors with healthy surrounding tissue <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> ; and quantitative approaches, e.g., comparing standardized uptake values (SUVs) with reported optimum SUV cut-off values, which vary from 2.5 to 4.5 <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> , or comparing the relative reduction in SUV between pre-and post-CRT FDG PET (ΔSUV) with reported optimum cut-off values, which vary from 35% to 70% <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Wide ranges of sensitivities and specificities have been reported.</s>
          <s>The variations appear to depend upon the different sets of criteria-which are a matter of ongoing debate-used for FDG PET interpretation.</s>
          <s>Using a qualitative interpretative criterion for response assessment of FDG PET is well established and internationally recognized as the standard of care in FDG-avid lymphoma (referred to as Deauville criteria) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> and useful in other malignancies including head and neck cancer <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , lung cancer <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> and cervical cancer <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similar harmonization guidelines for interpretive criteria are needed for esophageal cancer to compare results from different studies, to perform multicenter trials, and to assist clinical practice in different sites.</s>
          <s>We developed a simple, qualitative, interpretive criterion of FDG PET to assess esophageal cancer therapy.</s>
          <s>We validated its reader reproducibility, determined its value for predicting survival, and compared it with other visual-based and quantitative SUV-based assessment criteria.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>We found that using the proposed Qual 4PS qualitative interpretation criterion for post-CRT FDG PET to assess treatment response of ESCC provided good predictive value for survival outcome and yielded excellent interobserver agreement between reviewers from different hospitals.</s>
          <s>Additionally, it might offer a guide for deciding on post-CRT surgery.</s>
          <s>FDG PET has been evaluated to optimize monitoring therapeutic response of ESCC and other malignancies.</s>
          <s>Widely available and easy-to-use SUV is the method of choice in most studies.</s>
          <s>However, the reliability of SUV measurement is affected by many factors, such as inter-scanner variability, calibration errors, image acquisition and reconstruction parameters, attenuation correction, scatter correction, respiratory motion, and the partial volume effect, all of which make proper comparisons between different cohorts problematic <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One aim of this study was to determine whether a qualitative scoring system is practical and sufficiently robust to enable standardization of reporting across different hospitals.</s>
          <s>The major problems of a qualitative visual interpretation are the necessity of suitable criteria for interpretation and of reproducibility between different observers.</s>
          <s>Using the liver cut-off as a reference target seemed appropriate for post-therapy FDG PET interpretation.</s>
          <s>After they had studied a serial example of the scoring system <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig 1)</ref> , five reviewers from four different hospitals showed excellent agreement (Randolph's kappa: 0.95).</s>
          <s>Various analytic models have been published for predicting outcome and optimal discrimination between responders and nonresponders by defining (a) a cut-off level for the residual tumor FDG uptake on the post-therapy scan, or (b) a percentage decrease of SUV level between pre-and post-therapy scans.</s>
          <s>There is, however, no consensus about which post-therapy FDG PET cut-off criteria are the best predictors of the outcomes of ESCC patients or which most accurately identify patients who benefitted from surgery.</s>
          <s>Jeong et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> qualitatively defined PET-CR as a decreased FDG uptake to a level indistinguishable from that of the surrounding normal tissue.</s>
          <s>Moreover, SUV max levels � 3.0 <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> and &lt; 2.5 <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> have been used quantitatively for PET-CR.</s>
          <s>All of them verified that post-therapy PET-CR was a significant independent predictor of improved outcomes for CRT.</s>
          <s>There has been growing interest in using ΔSUV as a robust method of measuring metabolic response for predicting good and poor outcomes <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A large part of these studies chose the median value of their cohort data for the cut-off.</s>
          <s>Thus, a wide range of SUV reduction cut-offs, from 35% to 70%, have been reported <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The variance suggests a lack of standardization and might be explained by factors such as the spectrum of disease severity, and differences in the clinical features and therapy of each selected patient group.</s>
          <s>In this study, we also tested (a) the adjusted cut-off of SUV max3.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> , because of its optimal ability to detect post-CRT viable residual tumors in our institution <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> , and (b) the adjusted cut-off of ΔSUV max 71.6%, which was the median reduction value in this cohort.</s>
          <s>As expected, the adjusted cut-off of SUV max3.4 was better than the reported SUV max2.5 , and the adjusted cut-off of ΔSUV max71.6% was better than the reported ΔSUV max50% for predicting good and poor outcomes.</s>

        <p>
          <s>An optimal treatment strategy should balance improved survival with minimized therapyrelated morbidity, mortality, and quality-of-life deterioration.</s>
          <s>The necessity of surgical resection after CRT remains controversial.</s>
          <s>We found equivalent survival for patients in the CRTalone and trimodality groups, which was consistent with the results of other randomized trials in which most patients had ESCC <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>

          <s>Post-CRT esophagectomies are associated with an approximately 50% postoperative morbidity rate and a 10% postoperative mortality rate <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As in this cohort, the 1-and 2-month postoperative mortality rates were 9.3% and 14.0%, respectively.</s>
          <s>A non-invasive surrogate marker after CRT is needed to indicate that additional surgery can be delayed, or even omitted, or that is can be requested.</s>
          <s>An endoscopic biopsy for pathologic responses might not be the best predictor of outcomes after CRT in esophageal cancer; the association of PET-CR with outcomes is believed to be more clinically relevant <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Retrospective studies which evaluated the potential of PET response-adapted strategy to identify patients for whom surgery might be avoided reported that the OS of PET-CR patients treated with CRT alone were equivalent to those treated with trimodality therapy <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>

          <s>In a prospective multicenter study of 43 patients, tailoring treatment based on post-CRT FDG PET scans for selective surgical resection showed promising efficacy <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our study, the additional post-CRT esophagectomy significantly improved the OS of post-CRT Qual 4PS (+) patients, but it did not significantly improve the OS of post-CRT Qual 4PS (-) patients.</s>
          <s>After CRT, using FDG PET with the Qual 4PS interpretation criterion might be useful for determining the need for additional surgery.</s>
          <s>Large randomized multicenter studies to further evaluate this organ-preserving approach of individualized therapy are still required, however.</s>
          <s>We believe that the harmonious interpretation criterion "Qual 4PS " presented here is suitable for post-CRT FDG PET scans of future multicenter trials to identify patients who benefit from CRT and, therefore, have a favorable outcome.</s>
          <s>The study was retrospective and thus prone to a selection bias.</s>
          <s>Our results are not sufficient enough to change routine clinical practice for all esophageal cancer and should be interpreted cautiously.</s>
          <s>Six of the 19 patients (31.6%) with an SUV max between 2.9 and 3.8 were given discordant classifications by the reviewers.</s>
          <s>For tumor uptake within the relatively challenging SUV max range, we recommend that multiple reviewers be required for reaching a comprehensive consensus.</s>
          <s>It is necessary to include prospective trials that evaluate FDG PET response based on the Qual 4PS criterion to predict outcomes of esophageal cancer and that is embedded in a randomized treatment algorithm.</s>
