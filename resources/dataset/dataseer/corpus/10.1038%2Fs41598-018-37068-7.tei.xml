            <s>Few demonstrations have shown its potential from the aspect of nonlinear photonics; therefore, the mechanisms of momentum conservation among interacting light waves have been concealed by the restricted configuration under the phase-matching condition of periodically poled structures.</s>
            <s>Here, we unveil a tunable mechanism in the terahertz region by active control of the phase-matching condition.</s>
            <s>The tunability of backward terahertz-wave parametric oscillation is investigated using a quasi-collinear phase-matching model and its frequency range from the sub-terahertz to terahertz region is identified.</s>

            <s>Moreover, the cascading terahertz-wave generation enhances the photon conversion efficiency, thus making nonlinear optics and its applications more promising.</s>
            <s>The results highlight new capabilities for using modern ferroelectric materials and encourage further research on nonlinear optics.</s>

          <s>A single-longitudinal-mode sub-nanosecond Nd:YAG laser was used as a master oscillator for pumping the crystal.</s>
          <s>The pulse width and wavelength were 660 ps and 1064.34 nm, respectively.</s>
          <s>The wavelength linewidth was 0.01 nm measured by an optical spectrum analyser with spectrum resolution of 0.01 nm.</s>
          <s>The corresponding frequency bandwidth was limited to 3 GHz due to the resolution.</s>
          <s>The pulse energy of the pump beam was amplified up to 8.9 mJ by a master oscillator power amplifier consisting of a diode pumped Nd:YAG amplifier with a four-pass configuration.</s>

          <s>Polarisation of the pump beam was aligned along the z-axis of the PPLN crystal by a half-wave plate.</s>
          <s>For separation of the backward THz wave from the pump beam, an off-axis parabolic mirror (PM) with a hole for the pump beam was used with different beam divergence between the two.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the generated idler propagating forward was spatially separated from the pump beam under the QCPM condition.</s>

          <s>A shorter grating period is necessary to obtain frequencies higher than 1.2 THz.</s>
          <s>However, a crystal with a grating period less than 35 μm innately satisfies the phase-matching condition for conventional OPG <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>

          <s>The idler wavelengths of 1065.33 nm, 1065.51 nm, and 1065.70 nm were measured using the PPLN with a poling period of 53 μm at angles of 64.2°, 67.0°, and 69.8°, respectively.</s>

          <s>Narrowband oscillation is an inherent characteristic of backward-wave OPO, which can be explained by phase-matching condition between counter-propagating photons.</s>
          <s>Counter-propagating parametric photons, where the signal and idler waves propagate in the opposite directions, enforces strong constraints on the momentum mismatch.</s>
          <s>Thus, severe constraint on the spectrum provides narrowband oscillation.</s>

            <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (a) presents the spectra of the pump and idlers given by the optical spectrum analyser at a spectral resolution of 0.01 nm.</s>
          <s>Generally, the spectrum width of the generated idler is wide in a typical OPG process because of a broadband gain, even though a narrow-band pump beam is used.</s>
          <s>However, in backward oscillation, a narrow bandwidth comparable to that of the pump would be generated because of the inherent feedback effect.</s>
          <s>In the experiment, the narrow-band pump spectrum below 0.01 nm was irradiated into the PPLN and similar bandwidths of the idlers were measured as presented in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2(a)</ref> .</s>

          <s>The variation in the displacement of one silicon plate produced a clear interference pattern with peaks, which was fitted into the calculation curve.</s>
          <s>The result shows a wavelength of approximately 1000 μm (0.3 THz in frequency) and a narrow bandwidth of less than 7 GHz at a free spectral range of 37 GHz, with finesse of 6 for the etalon.</s>

          <s>The strong suppression of back-conversion and absence of other competing parasitic processes except for the forward TPG allow further rise in pump intensity, thereby reaching high efficiencies.</s>
          <s>Efficient backward TPO can be expected with high pump intensity up to the optical damage threshold, which was approximately 5 GW/cm 2 for MgO doped LN crystals.</s>
          <s>In comparison to an injection-seeded THz-wave parametric generation (is-TPG) using bulk LN, backward TPO has the significant advantage of a simple scheme combining a microchip laser as a pump source and a nonlinear crystal.</s>
          <s>The photon conversion efficiency was also equivalent to that of the is-TPG system because of the inhibit feedback effect.</s>
          <s>The advantage makes backward TPO a suitable field deployable source for highly demanding real-world chemical sensing applications.</s>
          <s>Moreover, THz-wave parametric generation in the sub-THz region using bulk LN would be difficult because of the low parametric gain.</s>

          <s>The observation of backward THz-wave frequency of 300 GHz pumped by the narrowband pump source with the maximum frequency bandwidth of 3 GHz demonstrates backward TPO occurring in the PPLN crystal.</s>
          <s>The significant threshold intensity and the non-collinear phase-matching condition were completely different behaviours compared with those of backward THz-wave generation based on the DFG process, which should satisfy the collinear phase-matching condition <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on the above facts, our work presents a completely different physical process from the conventional backward THz radiation.</s>
          <s>Moreover, backward TPO as a novel physical phenomenon was achieved.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The frequency tunability supported by theoretical calculation and experimental results is wide enough to consider applications such as non-destructive inspection, trace gas sensing, and THz spectroscopy.</s>
          <s>Backward TPO also shows excellent potential for compact and high conversion efficiency.</s>
          <s>These advantages make backward TPO a suitable field deployable source for most demanding real-world chemical sensing applications.</s>
