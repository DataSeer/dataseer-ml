            <s>Here, we unveil a tunable mechanism in the terahertz region by active control of the phase-matching condition.</s>
            <s>The tunability of backward terahertz-wave parametric oscillation is investigated using a quasi-collinear phase-matching model and its frequency range from the sub-terahertz to terahertz region is identified.</s>
            <s>Transform-limited terahertz-wave pulse is achieved simply by installing a device on the pump propagating line with no cavity.</s>
            <s>Moreover, the cascading terahertz-wave generation enhances the photon conversion efficiency, thus making nonlinear optics and its applications more promising.</s>
            <s>The results highlight new capabilities for using modern ferroelectric materials and encourage further research on nonlinear optics.</s>

            <s>The investigations have fascinated scientists in nonlinear optics and material science and enabled the realization of promising nonlinear phenomena.</s>

          <s>A single-longitudinal-mode sub-nanosecond Nd:YAG laser was used as a master oscillator for pumping the crystal.</s>
          <s>The pulse width and wavelength were 660 ps and 1064.34 nm, respectively.</s>
          <s>The wavelength linewidth was 0.01 nm measured by an optical spectrum analyser with spectrum resolution of 0.01 nm.</s>
          <s>The corresponding frequency bandwidth was limited to 3 GHz due to the resolution.</s>

          <s>The frequency shift in this experiment mainly originates from the angular shift between the pump vector and the 1 st idler vector, as shown in the inset of <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3(a)</ref> .</s>

          <s>In general, the efficiency of the backward OPOs does not exhibit saturation or roll-off caused by back-conversion to the pump, which typically occurs in conventional OPOs with co-propagating interactions.</s>
          <s>The strong suppression of back-conversion and absence of other competing parasitic processes except for the forward TPG allow further rise in pump intensity, thereby reaching high efficiencies.</s>
          <s>Efficient backward TPO can be expected with high pump intensity up to the optical damage threshold, which was approximately 5 GW/cm 2 for MgO doped LN crystals.</s>
          <s>In comparison to an injection-seeded THz-wave parametric generation (is-TPG) using bulk LN, backward TPO has the significant advantage of a simple scheme combining a microchip laser as a pump source and a nonlinear crystal.</s>
          <s>The photon conversion efficiency was also equivalent to that of the is-TPG system because of the inhibit feedback effect.</s>
          <s>The advantage makes backward TPO a suitable field deployable source for highly demanding real-world chemical sensing applications.</s>
          <s>Moreover, THz-wave parametric generation in the sub-THz region using bulk LN would be difficult because of the low parametric gain.</s>
          <s>For example, the parametric gain at 0.3 THz was almost a quarter of that at 2 THz, which was the frequency with the maximum parametric gain in bulk LN <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>

          <s>The observation of backward THz-wave frequency of 300 GHz pumped by the narrowband pump source with the maximum frequency bandwidth of 3 GHz demonstrates backward TPO occurring in the PPLN crystal.</s>
          <s>The significant threshold intensity and the non-collinear phase-matching condition were completely different behaviours compared with those of backward THz-wave generation based on the DFG process, which should satisfy the collinear phase-matching condition <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on the above facts, our work presents a completely different physical process from the conventional backward THz radiation.</s>
          <s>Moreover, backward TPO as a novel physical phenomenon was achieved.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The frequency tunability supported by theoretical calculation and experimental results is wide enough to consider applications such as non-destructive inspection, trace gas sensing, and THz spectroscopy.</s>
          <s>Backward TPO also shows excellent potential for compact and high conversion efficiency.</s>
          <s>These advantages make backward TPO a suitable field deployable source for most demanding real-world chemical sensing applications.</s>
