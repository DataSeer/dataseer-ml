            <s>Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China.</s>
            <s>A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Îœurr.</s>
            <s>(Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect.</s>
            <s>However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood.</s>
            <s>In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro.</s>
            <s>At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis.</s>
            <s>Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells.</s>
            <s>Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier.</s>
            <s>These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC.</s>

            <s>Cancer is currently one of the most important public health problems in the world.</s>
            <s>Despite improvements in diagnosis, surgical techniques, health care, and adjuvant therapy in recent years, which are all aimed at decreasing cancer mortality, carcinomas greatly attribute to human death.</s>
            <s>Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1 , and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year are diagnosed in China 2,3 .</s>
            <s>However, most GC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and are no longer indicated for curative treatment 3,4 .</s>
            <s>Moreover, recurrence and metastasis are recognised as the most important obstacles to the therapeutic effects and poor patient survival of GC, and most deaths result from metastatic gastric carcinomas that are resistant to conventional therapies.</s>
            <s>Therefore, studies on the mechanism of GC metastasis and clinical trials of new drugs that could provide more effective therapy have attracted increasing attention.</s>

            <s>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of three millennia in Asia 5 .</s>
            <s>Due to its synergistic therapeutic effects and non-significant toxicity in cancer therapy, an increasing number of TCM components have been explored as alternative or complementary anti-cancer agents.</s>

          <s>However, the use of a high concentration reduces the effectiveness and universality of aqueous Huaier extract.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the efficiency of water extraction depends on the polarity of the targeted compounds.</s>
          <s>The bioactive compounds isolated by water extraction are mainly anthocyanins, tannins, saponins, and terpenoids <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>

          <s>Many active components are not water-soluble and are thus difficult to extract.</s>
          <s>In addition, temperature influences the bioactivity and composition of water extracts, including the loss of volatile components and the destruction of heat-sensitive ingredients.</s>
          <s>Therefore, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during extraction with water is unavoidable.</s>
          <s>In light of these issues, we improved the extraction method and performed the extraction using different solvents, yielding five organic phases: petroleum ether, ethylacetate, n-butanol, an ethanol phase, and a water phase.</s>
          <s>In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that Huaier extract inhibits the proliferation of human GC MKN-45 cells.</s>
          <s>The most effective site is the locus of n-butanol, which inhibited GC MKN45 cell proliferation at a lower concentration than aqueous Huaier extract <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>

          <s>Flavonoids play important roles in cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy.</s>

            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example, flavonoids from licorice extract may be useful chemopreventive agents for peptic ulcers or GC in Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>Sophoranone, extracted from the TCM Shan Dou Gen, inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, including human stomach cancer MKN7 cells and human leukaemia U937 cells <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>Generally, more than 50% of a certain component in the extract of TCM can be considered the main component of the extract.</s>

(B) Quantitative analysis of migration speed using the migration index (n = 3, bar graphs are plotted as the mean Â± SD, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, Student's t-test). (C) Detection of cell invasion using high-throughput screening multi-well insert 24-well two-chamber plates. White bars represent 100 Î¼m. (D) Quantitative analysis of invaded cells (n = 3, bar graphs are plotted as the mean Â± SD, ***p &lt; 0.001, Student's t-test). (E) Immunoblot analysis of the expression of vimentin, c-Myc, and Bmi1 using the corresponding antibodies.</figDesc>
