          <head>Sigma class GST (Prostaglandin D synthase), FhGST-S1, is present in the excretory-secretory products (ES) of the liver fluke parasite Fasciola hepatica as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the parasite.</head>

            <s>FhGST-S1 has a well characterised role in the modulation of the immune response; a key fluke intercession that allows for establishment and development within their hosts.</s>
            <s>We have resolved the three-dimensional structure of FhGST-S1 in complex with its co-factor glutathione, in complex with a glutathione-cysteine adduct, and in a glutathione disulfide complex in order to initiate a research pipeline to mechanistically understand how FhGST-S1 functions within the host environment and to rationally design selective inhibitors.</s>
            <s>The overall fold of FhGST-S1 shows high structural similarity to other Sigma class GSTs.</s>
            <s>However, a unique interdomain disulfide bond was found in the FhGST-S1 which could stabilise the structure within the host gastro-intestinal environment.</s>
            <s>The position of the two domains of the protein with respect to each other is seen to be crucial in the formation of the active site cleft of the enzyme.</s>
            <s>The interdomain disulfide bond raises the possibility of oxidative regulation of the active site of this GST protein.</s>

            <s>Following ingestion, metacercariae excyst from their dormant stage and penetrate the intestinal wall before migrating to the liver and subsequently the bile ducts where they develop into their mature form 5 .</s>

            <s>Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice for humans and domesticated animals as it targets both pathogenic juvenile and adult fluke.</s>
            <s>TCBZ failure and resistance is increasingly being reported in many countries, raising concerns of how to control the disease in the absence of new flukicides and vaccines 6 .</s>

          <s>Several DMSO molecules were located in the GSSG complex structure, where this organic solvent was added to increase the solubility of the inhibitor TCBZ.</s>

          <s>The electron density was of high enough quality to differentiate several main chain second positions and multiple alternative side chain positions in both structures.</s>
          <s>The disulfides in both structures were partially formed and the cysteines were refined both as disulfide and free thiols.</s>
          <s>In both structures Pro54 of each subunit is in the cis conformation.</s>

          <s>The sheet is flanked by helices α1 (residues 15-26) and α3 (residues 71-81) on one side and on the other by α2 (residues 41-51) including the short 3 10 helices α2 and α2′.</s>

          <s>The formation of the dimer buries 2922 Å 2 of the solvent accessible surface area.</s>
          <s>This means that 13% of the subunit solvent accessible surface of 11189 Å 2 is buried upon oligomerization.</s>
          <s>Interaction between the two subunits is by 11 hydrogen bonds and 151 non-bonded contacts between 21 amino acid residues from each chain.</s>

The second glutathione molecule bound to both active sites of the GSSG-structure does not occupy the same site as the cysteine ligand in the CGL complex. The second glutathione makes few direct interactions, forming bonds to Arg 52 of the same subunit and Glu 108 of the other subunit. Non-binding interactions are made from the side chains of amino acids Tyr 110 from the same subunit and Asn 131 and Leu 135 from the other. No interactions are made from the half of the molecule that protrudes away from the active site, and this part of the glutathione is seen to occupy different spaces in each of the monomers. Comparison of holo, GSSG-structures and CGL complex. Superposition of the two subunits of the holo-structure reveals that there are very few changes in response to the binding of the cysteine ligand. There is a small movement of the Tyr10 side chain, resulting in a movement of 0.7 Å between the OH atom positions.</figDesc>

It also has hydrogen bonds to three main chain atoms (Val 53 N and O, Ser 71 N) and three hydrogen bonds to amino acid side chain atoms (Tyr 10 OH, Trp 41 NE2, Ser 71 OG). The Sγ atom of the GSH is modelled in two positions, A and B. In position A this atom is at a distance of 4.6 Å from the Tyr10 OH, and 2.77 Å from a water molecule (HOH 2155). In the alternative conformation, position B, the Sγ atom is 3.1 Å from the Tyr10 OH atom and 2.9 Å from the same water molecule. The interactions of GSH are the same as those above in both subunit A of the holo-structure and in both subunits of the GSSG-structure, with the exception of the distance of the Tyr10 OH atom to the Sγ atoms of the CGL and GSSG complexes. In the CGL complex the Tyr10 OH is 2.89 Å from the Sγ atom position of the free GSH and 4.15 Å from the Sγ atom in the CGL complex. There are no water molecules closer than 4.9 Å. In the GSSG complex subunits the Tyr10 OH atom is closer to the Sγ atoms of the GSSG complex than the Sγ atom of the GSH. In subunit A Tyr10 OH is at a distance of 3.35 Å and in subunit B 3.19 Å from the Sγ atom of the GSSG complex. In the case of the GSH, the distances are 4.25 Å for subunit A and 4.45 Å for subunit B and again there are no water molecules closer than 3.6 Å. The altered position of the Tyr10 side chain may be influenced by the presence of a DMSO molecule in the active site of each subunit. The oxygen atom of the DMSO in subunit A (DMS 1214) is 2.67 Å from the Tyr10 OH, and in subunit B (DMS 1212) 2.37 Å from the OH group.</figDesc>
