          <head>Mass balance analysis of ice sheets is a key component to understand the effects of global warming. A significant component of ice sheet and shelf mass balance is iceberg calving, which can generate large tsunamis endangering human beings and coastal infrastructure.

            <s>Calving icebergs interact with the surrounding water through different mechanisms and we investigate five; A: capsizing, B: gravity-dominated fall, C: buoyancy-dominated fall, D: gravity-dominated overturning and E: buoyancy-dominated overturning.</s>
            <s>Gravity-dominated icebergs essentially fall into the water body whereas buoyancydominated icebergs rise to the water surface.</s>
            <s>We find with unique large-scale laboratory experiments that iceberg-tsunami heights from gravity-dominated mechanisms (B and D) are roughly an order of magnitude larger than from A, C and E. A theoretical model for released iceberg energy supports this finding and the measured wave periods upscaled to Greenlandic outlet glaciers agree with field observations.</s>
            <s>Whilst existing empirical equations for landslide-tsunamis establish estimates of an upper envelope of the maximum iceberg-tsunami heights, they fail to capture the physics of most icebergtsunami mechanisms.</s>

            <s>Iceberg calving accounts for most of the mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 6 and for 32% of the Greenland Ice Sheet 8,14 between 2009-2012 of its overall ice mass loss of approximately −269 ± 51 Gt/year 12 .</s>

            <s>This type of waves, called iceberg-tsunamis hereafter (short for iceberg-generated tsunamis), is the focus of this work.</s>
            <s>Iceberg-tsunamis are typically observed in the summer season at grounded glaciers such as Helheim 5 and Eqip Sermia 15 and also for mountain glaciers including the Tasman Glacier 16 .</s>

            <s>Recorded iceberg-tsunamis include an amplitude of 50 m at Eqip Sermia, Greenland, destroying infrastructure in 2014 15 and a 24 cm large wave approximately 25 km from the Helheim outlet glacier in east Greenland 21 .</s>

            <s>Nevertheless, such an event destroyed a harbour in Greenland in 1995 24 .</s>
            <s>Such observed extreme events raise the question which magnitude iceberg-tsunamis may reach and how dangerous they are for human beings and our coastal infrastructure.</s>

          <s>The blocks interacted with the surrounding water through five iceberg calving mechanisms A: capsizing, B: gravity-dominated fall, C: buoyancy-dominated fall, D: gravity-dominated overturning and E: buoyancy-dominated overturning.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The tsunami heights generated by mechanisms B and D (gravity-dominated) were roughly an order of magnitude larger than from mechanisms A, C and E. A theoretical model for the capsizing case was applied to the remaining mechanisms to compute the released iceberg energy, supporting that gravity-dominated iceberg calving generate the largest waves.</s>
          <s>However, only between 0.6 to 56.9% of the released energy is transferred into the wave train with the rest lost in other processes.</s>
          <s>Results were upscaled to Greenlandic outlet glaciers and the wave periods agree well with field observations.</s>
          <s>The iceberg-tsunamis were also predicted with empirical equations for landslide-tsunamis resulting in a good match for some gravity dominated cases and estimates of an upper envelope of the maximum iceberg-tsunami heights over all mechanisms.</s>
          <s>However, these equations fail to capture the physics of most iceberg-tsunami mechanisms such that the new research field of iceberg-tsunamis requires more attention.</s>

For our iceberg-tsunami experiments 2,033,835 ≤ R ≤ 3,131,294 and 75,552 ≤ W ≤ 134,315, based on a kinematic viscosity ν w = 10 −6 m 2 /s and surface tension σ w = 0.073 N/m at the water temperature of 19.3 °C in our experiments. The kinematic viscosity for a sea temperature of 0 °C approximately observed around Greenland is with ν w = 1.8 × 10 −6 m 2 /s lower than in the laboratory, improving the laboratory experiments to field similarity further as the lower temperature reduces R observed in nature by nearly a factor of two to R ≈ 2 − 39 × 10 9 (at h = 125 to 800 m). Scale effects are therefore expected to be insignificant and the figures in Fig. 5b may directly be transferred to field conditions based on Froude scaling 29 . For a water depth h ≈ 125 m observed in the fjord of the Eqip Sermia Glacier 15 , the investigated scenarios result in maximum wave heights of up to 20.0 m (mechanisms B and D) and 2.5 m for the three remaining mechanisms. The measured wave periods of the maximum wave heights are 0.36 to 2.09 s at laboratory scale (Fig. S1) corresponding to a period of up to 23.4 s in nature after Froude scaling 29 (at scale 1:125). This results in a wavelength of 694 m by using the linear wave dispersion relation (Supplementary Methods).For a scale of 1:800 matching a water depth h ≈ 800 m for typical Greenlandic settings such as the Helheim Glacier 5 and Jakobshavn Isbrae 27 , the maximum wave height of mechanisms B and D is unlikely to be reached due to the limited iceberg thickness above water. However, mechanisms A, C and E would be predicted to result in a maximum wave height of up to 16.0 m. The corresponding maximum period is 59.</figDesc>

Mechanism B (Figs 1c, 2b and 3a, Supplementary Movie S2): the blocks were held in position with an electromagnet via a winch system supported with a purpose-built steel frame which was fixed to the basin wall. Mechanism C(Figs 1c and 2c, Supplementary Movie S3): the blocks were pulled under water with a rope attached to the centre of the block bottom. In addition, the blocks were stabilised with a steel beam from above for some of the tests. Mechanisms D and E(Figs 1c and 2d,e, Supplementary Movies S4 and S5)</figDesc>
