            <s>Previous studies have suggested that exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD).</s>
            <s>The data from the Mayak nuclear worker cohort have indicated enhanced risk for IHD incidence.</s>
            <s>The goal of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced IHD by integrating proteomics data with a transcriptomics study on post mortem cardiac left ventricle samples from Mayak workers categorized in four radiation dose groups (0 Gy, &lt; 100 mGy, 100-500 mGy, &gt; 500 mGy).</s>
            <s>The proteomics data that were newly analysed here, originated from a label-free analysis of cardiac samples.</s>
            <s>The transcriptomics analysis was performed on a subset of these samples.</s>
            <s>Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to correct the age-dependent changes in protein expression, enabling the separation of proteins, the expression of which was dependent only on the radiation dose, age or both of these factors.</s>
            <s>Importantly, the majority of the proteins showed only dose-dependent expression changes.</s>
            <s>Hierarchical clustering of the proteome and transcriptome profiles confirmed the separation of control and high-dose samples.</s>
            <s>Restrictive (separate p-values) and integrative (combined p-value) approaches were used to investigate the enrichment of biological pathways.</s>
            <s>The integrative method proved superior in the validation of the key biological pathways found in the proteomics analysis, namely PPAR signalling, TCA cycle and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.</s>
            <s>This study presents a novel, improved, and comprehensive statistical approach of analysing biological effects on a limited number of samples.</s>

          <s>To elucidate biological mechanisms behind the increased heart disease risk, Azimzadeh et al. used a different approach <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A proteomic study was conducted using post mortem samples of cardiac left ventricle tissue from Mayak workers who were exposed to different external doses of ionizing radiation during their lifetime.</s>
          <s>Non-exposed individuals of the same area were used as the control population.</s>
          <s>Both controls and exposed workers died of ischemic heart disease <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study clearly showed adverse dose-dependent alterations in the heart energy consumption that were strongly linked to the deactivation of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) alpha, a key regulator of cardiac metabolism <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, one of the main observations of the study was a dose-dependent increase in the number of downregulated mitochondrial proteins <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>It is known from previous studies that, in ischemic conditions, the preferred energy source of the heart is glycolytic ATP derivation rather than the usage of fatty acid sources <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>

          <s>Interestingly, in the radiation-induced ischemic heart disease, a large number of proteins involved in glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were down-regulated, indicating deactivation of both energy pathways <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , an exceptional situation in the cardiac energy paradigm <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>

          <s>This study aims to deepen further the knowledge of potential molecular mechanisms related to radiation-induced human heart pathology.</s>
          <s>It is firstly achieved by expanding the basic statistical analyses performed on raw proteomics data in <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , secondly by performing a gene expression analysis using whole-transcript cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methodology from a subset of the Mayak samples, and thirdly by integrating the newly generated proteomics and transcriptomics data sets.</s>
          <s>Using stepwise regression analysis, this study could separate the differentially regulated proteins in two categories: those that were deregulated only by the radiation dose and those that were dependent only on the age, which is an important development with regard to the study in <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The correlation test between BMI and age showed a p-value of 0.722 and between BMI and dose a p-value of 0.814.</s>
          <s>Therefore, multiple stepwise linear regression analyses with external dose and worker age as explanatory variables were conducted for each protein to identify those for which abundance variation was only dose dependent as opposed to proteins with age-only dependent variation or those for which none or both of the factors explained the existing variation.</s>
          <s>Additionally, BMI was also examined as a factor in the regression analysis.</s>
          <s>Smoking habits and alcohol consumption could not serve as explanatory variables due to the lack of variation among the studied individuals, all of whom were smokers and drinkers.</s>

          <s>A total of 582 proteins (of 1, 281 identified) fell into the dose-only dependent ("dose-only") category, 225 being only age-only dependent ("age-only").</s>

        <p>
          <s>The substantial contribution of this study compared to the previous proteomics analysis <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> was the use of custom statistical methods to distinguish dose-only dependent protein expression changes from the age-only dependent changes.</s>
          <s>By the use of an integrative statistical analysis approach, adapted to the nature of the analysed data, the discovered proteomic processes could be verified by the gene expression study.</s>
          <s>Pathways such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, citric acid cycle and, importantly, PPAR signalling were confirmed using a novel p-value integration technique, as opposed to the use of a conventional restrictive result comparison procedure.</s>
          <s>This non-standard pipeline for merging data sets opens the door for new statistical methodologies and emphasises the importance of careful planning in the stepwise analysis in order to obtain valid conclusions.</s>
