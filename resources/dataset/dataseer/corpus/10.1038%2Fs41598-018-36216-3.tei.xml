          <s>The transmitted part of the x-ray pulse through the gratings acted as a 'pump' , whilst those diffracted by the gratings 'probed' the sample at precise time delays determined by their extended optical paths relative to the transmitted pulse.</s>
          <s>On the sample, half of the probe beams are spatially overlapped with the pump pulse, while the other half was separated by 70 μm from the pumped region.</s>
          <s>The uniqueness of the setup has been demonstrated previously <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>The two major differences from the previous work in this experiment are: finer time steps of 20-50 fs for an overall coverage of 300 fs, allowing higher probing time resolution, and, 2-5 times higher grating diffraction efficiency resulting in better signal-to-noise ratio.</s>

          <s>To ensure the spatial overlap, spot sizes of the pump and the probe pulses were focused to a FWHM of 35 ± 5 μm and 12.5 ± 2.5 μm, respectively.</s>

          <s>The fluence levels are 2.46 J/cm 2 , 1.48 J/cm 2 , and 0.91 J/cm 2 , corresponding to the average absorbed dose values of 3.5 eV/atom, 2.1 eV/atom, and 1.3 eV/atom, respectively.</s>

          <s>We emphasize here that the signal dynamics seen in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> cannot be due to x-ray intensity and spectral fluctuations, or due to any crystal imperfections, since the time sequences were taken from the same pulse in single shot and from the same region of the crystal.</s>
          <s>The dynamics at the lowest absorption dose of 1.3 eV/atom (at 0.91 J/cm 2 ) in our case could be considered similar to the highest dose cases presented in ref. <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13</ref> (1.2 eV/atom for Bi) and in ref. <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23</ref> (0.35 eV/atom for Sb) -implying that the PES map at this x-ray dose should be highly anharmonic and described by a single-minimum-well.</s>
          <s>For such a case, it is expected that the disordering of the lattice follows a relatively direct path, possibly by a direct anharmonic coupling of the initially excited A 1g motion coordinate to that of the degenerate E g optical mode <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">8,</ref>

          <s>Our signal decays in less than half a picosecond ruling out the possibility of a thermal melting process.</s>
          <s>We also note that the observed femtosecond transition triggered by 10 13~1 0 14 W/cm 2 pump intensity excludes the possibility of fast collisional heating through photoexcited electrons <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">24</ref> as a dominant heating process.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>In the thermal melting regime, dramatic changes in the crystal structure can only be observed after significant atomic heating due to the electron-ion energy exchange.</s>
          <s>This process takes time typically of the order of ps <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> at the pump pulse fluences considered here.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the complete signal drop within 300 fs, seen in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> , casts out the lattice disorder through its thermalisation as a possible cause.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>If, on the other hand, the diffraction signal drop is due to strong ionisation only, one would expect a significant change of the Bi atomic scattering factor due to ionisation of core-electrons.</s>
          <s>However an ionisation degree estimated with the non-local thermodynamic-equilibrium (non-LTE) radiation transfer code, CRETIN <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> , points to less than 1 electron per atom being excited in the first 100 fs after the pump, at our highest intensity of 10 14 W/cm (equivalent to 3.5 eV/atom) (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. (ii)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Indeed, an estimate of the scattered intensity based on XATOM code <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31</ref> suggest that, to realise the observed signal drop, the normalised scattering factors of Bi should be at least ~0.8.</s>
          <s>This corresponds to an average ionisation degree of more than ~10 per atom in the initial state (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. (i)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>To reach such a degree of ionisation would require orders of magnitude higher x-ray intensity than we have in this experiment, which would push the sample into a plasma state.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This leaves a non-thermal melting process as the most likely interpretation of the observed transition, where a modification of interatomic potential due to high electronic excitation induces a lattice instability <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>Given the average absorbed pump doses (1.3~3.5 eV/atom) in our cases, we conclude that 0.3~1.4</s>
          <s>atoms for every 1000 atoms underwent photoabsorption.</s>
          <s>Therefore, ~0.1% of the atoms have one inner-shell hole due to photo-excitation, which is immediately filled through an Auger process occurring in a sub-fs timescale <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>Immediately after photo-excitation, this process creates only ~0.1% holes in the valence or conduction bands, and the core holes are promptly filled.</s>
          <s>We can then assume that in the first instants after photoexcitation the interatomic potential is not significantly perturbed.</s>
          <s>Meanwhile the free energy of the sample increases by the amount of the absorbed energy, which is stored in high energy (&gt;keV) photoelectrons.</s>
          <s>In a conventional non-thermal melting processes, the following dynamics has been discussed, especially for the case of semiconductors <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>A fast electron distributes its energy through collisional interactions repetitively until it settles down into bound states.</s>
          <s>At the same time the electron cascading processes further excite electrons from the valence to the conduction band, altering the electron density distribution and thus the interatomic potential, and consequently leading to lattice disorder.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Given that x-ray diffraction is mainly sensitive to the changes in core electron density, it should be noted that Bragg diffraction signal is, in principle, not directly sensitive to the PES.</s>
          <s>Indeed, for hard x-ray excited Si with similar absorbed doses to our case <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , the start of the Bragg diffraction signal decay was observed after ~110 fs from the incidence of the pump.</s>
          <s>The similar excitation condition in Bi in our case also implies a significantly low ionisation degree, thus low photoelectron population, despite the absorbed dose is up to a few times higher than its damage threshold <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>For reflections insensitive to optical modes, similarly to the Si or diamond cases <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> , one could expect a short period of delay until the onset of signal drop can be observed.</s>
          <s>However, from Bi (111) the onset of the signal decay is almost immediate, especially for the highest excitation case.</s>
          <s>It indicates an atomic dislocation process occurring in parallel to non-thermal melting process.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The fluence dependence of our measurements (as seen in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> ), carries additional information on the possible phenomena occurring upon photoexcitation.</s>
          <s>Scenarios such as thermal excitation of the lattice (Debye-Waller) would exhibit a fluence dependence only in the amplitude of the exponentially decreasing diffracted intensity.</s>
          <s>In contrast, here both the amplitude and the gradient leading to the normalised intensity of ~0.5 in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> show fluence dependence -an observation compatible with the displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP) <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">12</ref> .</s>
          <s>Theoretical modelling of the DECP process is primarily dependent on the pump pulse duration (shorter than the phonon oscillation period) and on the absorbed power density.</s>
          <s>Presence of energetic excited electrons leads to excitation of many outer electrons, thus a coherent motion of the lattice is induced as a result of changes of PES, likely contributing to the building up of a non-thermal melting process.</s>
          <s>Assuming that DECP process is initiated, the potential implication following here is a strong anharmonic coupling between the A 1g and the E g optical modes leading to a phase transition on the timescale less than one period of the A 1g mode, as discussed also in ref. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">8</ref> .</s>
          <s>We therefore speculate that this coherent lattice motion could be the precursor to the observed non-thermal melting process on such a rapid timescale.</s>
          <s>These stages of transition dynamics initiated by hard x-rays are thus most likely relevant for materials with A 1 optical modes in general.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, we have performed the first-time observation of x-ray induced lattice disordering in Bi occurring within less than 300 fs.</s>
          <s>The (111) Bragg peak dynamics indicates that the phase transition proceeds as a complex multistep process.</s>
          <s>Our data set an important benchmark for future experiments and modelling of the hard x-ray induced ultrafast phase-transition in Bi, which should reproduce the observed fluence dependence.</s>
          <s>For that purpose, there is a strong need for a development of dedicated theoretical models capable of following such complex non-equilibrium dynamics in time.</s>
          <s>Promising candidates currently being developed are time-dependent Density Functional Theory or Hartree-Fock based schemes.</s>

Each of these gratings diffracts a small portion of the incoming x-ray pulse in the y-z plane, at varying angles defined by their pitch. The diffracted pulses are then rediffracted back by the G2-gratings, to overlap with the transmitted primary pulse within ±3 μm precision. (b) X-Z plane view of the setup. All the transmitted and diffracted pulses satisfy the Bragg condition of the sample in the x-z plane. The pulses that diffract from the sample are separated along the y-axis and aligned along the x-axis. They are then recorded on a 2D detector (JUNGFRAU).</figDesc>
