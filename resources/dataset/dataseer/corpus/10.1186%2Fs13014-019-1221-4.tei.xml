          <s>IPF is a pulmonary disease associated with a dismal prognosis.</s>
          <s>The median survival of patients with IPF ranges from 2.5 years to 3.5 years and the 5-year survival ranges between 20 and 40% <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The condition can be acutely exacerbated by a range of triggering factors, including infection, surgery, and RT.</s>
          <s>Yamashita et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> demonstrated that severe pulmonary toxicity was observed in nine out of thirteen patients with IPF after SBRT, and seven of these cases were fatal.</s>
          <s>The presence of IPF shadow on CT was found to correlate well with the severe pulmonary toxicity.</s>
          <s>However, there was no correlation between the DVH parameters and the severe pulmonary toxicity.</s>
          <s>This may imply that even a small volume of RT including SBRT is not safe.</s>
          <s>Accordingly, PS performance status, PY pack-year, FEV 1 forced expiratory volume in 1 s, DLCO diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, RT radiation therapy, 3DCRT 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, SBRT stereotactic body radiation therapy, TRC treatment-related complications they suggested that pre-screening for an IPF pattern on CT should be performed before SBRT in patients with lung cancer and underlying IPF. Lee et al. <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> evaluated the relationship between interstitial lung changes in the pre-radiotherapy CT and symptomatic pulmonary toxicity.</s>
          <s>The risk of pulmonary toxicity grade ≥ 2, ≥3, or ≥ 4 was higher in patients with interstitial lung change than patients without (grade 2, 15.6 to 46.7%, p = 0.03; grade 3, 4.4 to 40%, p = 0.002; grade 4, 4.4 to 33.3%, p = 0.008).</s>
          <s>Four out of the five patients with grade 5 pulmonary toxicity had diffuse interstitial changes on pre-radiotherapy CT.</s>
          <s>Recently, Ono et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> reported the clinical results of proton RT in patients with IPF.</s>
          <s>The cumulative incidence of pulmonary toxicity was 19.8%, including one case of treatment-related death.</s>
          <s>This study was the first report on the incidence of pulmonary toxicity after proton RT in IPF patients.</s>
          <s>They showed that grade 4 or 5 pulmonary toxicity occurred at a rate of 6.3%, which was lower than that reported in previous studies with X-ray treatment.</s>
          <s>This result suggests that proton RT may reduce the incidence of life-threatening pulmonary complications in patients with IPF compared to that with X-ray irradiation.</s>
          <s>Current study has several limitations.</s>
          <s>First, it is a retrospective analysis and there may be some selection biases.</s>
          <s>Second, the sample size is too small to show a statistical significance of difference between the two groups.</s>
          <s>Despite the lack of statistical significance due to small number of cases, our preliminary analysis is the first one to directly compare X-ray and proton therapy for lung cancer patients with IPF, and shows a promising result that is concordant with previous studies (summarized in <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">Table 5</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Although patients that received proton therapy had poorer diffusing capacity and higher GAP stages compared to X-ray, the incidence of severe treatment-related pulmonary complications was observed less frequently in the proton group (40.9% in X-ray vs. 12.5% in proton), and the incidence of treatment-related death occurred in four patients (18.2%) treated with X-ray <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> but none with proton therapy.</s>
          <s>In addition, patients treated with proton therapy showed a tendency of better overall one-year survival compared to X-ray.</s>
          <s>Especially, proton therapy showed significantly increased survival outcomes compared to X-ray in patients with higher GAP stage (II and III) subgroups (1-year OS rate; 50.0%</s>
          <s>versus 26.4%, p = 0.036).</s>
          <s>These promising results with proton therapy may be because proton therapy could affect a smaller lung volume than X-ray irradiation.</s>
          <s>However, there were no statistically significant differences in the dosimetric factors of the patients, including MLD, V 5 , V 10 and V 20 of lung although CTV was significantly larger in the proton RT group.</s>
          <s>We hope our ongoing prospective study with a large number of patients and systematic evaluation of pre-and post-treatment lung functions could confirm the benefit of proton therapy for patients with severely compromised pulmonary function and/or IPF.</s>
