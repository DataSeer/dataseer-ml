            <s>Background: The Parent Infant Feeding Initiative (PIFI) was a factorial, randomised controlled trial that aimed to prolong exclusive breastfeeding by targeting expecting fathers.</s>
            <s>One of the intervention strategies evaluated was a father-focused breastfeeding class facilitated by a male peer facilitator.</s>
            <s>The aim of this mixed-methods descriptive study was to 1) evaluate the feedback provided from participants of the class and 2) explore the motivations and experiences of volunteer male peer facilitators trained to deliver the class.</s>
            <s>Methods: Father-focused breastfeeding antenatal (FFAB) classes were conducted in six Western Australian hospitals between August 2015 and December 2016.</s>
            <s>Following each peer facilitated FFAB class, expecting father participants completed an evaluation form to assess their satisfaction with the format, facilitation and content, in addition to whether their expectations and confidence to manage breastfeeding problems had changed.</s>
            <s>Feedback to open-ended questions was analysed using content analysis to identify learnings and suggestions for improvements.</s>
            <s>At the completion of PIFI, individual telephone interviews were undertaken with 14 peer facilitators to gain insight into their motivations for volunteering and experiences of conducting the classes.</s>
            <s>Transcripts from interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six phases for thematic analysis.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>There is convincing empirical evidence that the positive attitudes and support of her partner exert a strong influence on a woman's decision to breastfeed, and are critical to the successful initiation and duration of breastfeeding <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The importance of getting the 'right help at the right time' has been acknowledged by Australian breastfeeding mothers <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> and during times of need, individuals turn to social relationships for social support when they are unable to access the health-care system or when they find it deficient <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Given the ready availability of fathers to support their breastfeeding partners, failing to recognize and capitalize on the father's role as a key support person represents a lost opportunity.</s>
          <s>International researchers have already established that women who have strong social support from their partner are more likely to initiate and continue breastfeeding <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A qualitative study of Swedish fathers' experiences of their prenatal preparation identified their desire to acquire knowledge and form realistic expectations around parenthood that included developing strategies to adjust to being a father and being supported as a new father <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, a meta-synthesis of 23 qualitative studies involving fathers' encounters during childbirth suggests that although fathers feel they are a partner and parent, experiences within maternity care contribute to their feeling excluded and fearful <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These findings are replicated in studies specific to the perceptions and experiences of fathers with regards to their role as breastfeeding supporters <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Research suggests that fathers are generally supportive of breastfeeding but that they lack knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding, the risks associated with formula feeding, and the knowledge and skills to support their partner to breastfeed <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, fathers are generally unaware of how challenging breastfeeding can be and want more information and preparation with a focus on problem solving, so they are better able to support their partner <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, while they are encouraged to attend antenatal classes with their partners, these classes are generally directed at the mother, focused on the birthing process with limited discussion of breastfeeding, and in general do not directly acknowledge or address the support role that the father can provide <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Resolving this issue is paramount given that fathers' participation across the childbearing continuum is associated with long-term involvement and improved child development outcomes <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The perinatal period provides an opportunity for connecting with fathers at a time when they are experiencing change, highly motivated and looking for support <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, father engagement in parenting programs is often low with a commonly cited reason being the lack of a male presence in these programs <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Maternity services are staffed predominantly by females and entering this environment can be an intimidating experience for fathers <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Father-led peer support programs provide a means of addressing this barrier to active engagement.</s>
          <s>The underlying rationale for father-led peer support breastfeeding programs has been succinctly expressed by Stremler and Lovera: "peer dads become role models and can share information and suggestions in a non-authoritative manner that allows fathers to gain information and confidence in their ability to make decisions and care for their families" (p418) <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Fathers are likely to feel less intimidated in sharing their concerns and asking questions of a peer-father compared to a female health professional <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Relatively little attention has been paid to the effectiveness of breastfeeding peer support programs which target the father <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, while peer support is acknowledged as an effective strategy to supplement the services of health professionals, the experiences of the peer support personnel are generally not explored.</s>
          <s>In particular, the experiences of the male facilitators in providing support to expectant fathers have not been investigated.</s>
          <s>The aim of this study therefore, was to: 1) evaluate the feedback provided from participants of a father-focused antenatal breastfeeding class (FFAB class); and 2) explore the motivations and experiences of the volunteer male peer facilitators who were trained to deliver the FFAB class.</s>

          <s>All but two facilitators either had a university degree or were current students enrolled in a health related degree such as physiotherapy or nursing.</s>
          <s>In July 2015, 18 potential facilitators received a total of 4 hours of training over two evenings, 1 week apart, to become FFAB class peer facilitators.</s>

          <s>Oliver spoke about his engaged conversations with participants: I actually enjoyed the conversations with the guys, that opportunity to have that conversation pretty much was the reason I kept going back.</s>
          <s>Equally the facilitators spoke of the benefits of the dads making connections with each other: How they (the dads) felt it was a really good thing, and that they got a lot out of it… you know that the dads enjoyed it and were able to engage with other dads.</s>

          <s>Oliver's self-encouragement was also derived from a belief that positive change was being created: You know that breastfeeding is a good… there's nothing better than being able to share that… to make sure that these babies get that advantage in life.</s>

          <s>Alex voiced his difficulties with time pressures: The time factor was difficult for me, just with work and Uni [university] and family.</s>
          <s>So that probably just made it a bit difficult for me at times, to just sort of work around.</s>
          <s>For one participant, Matthew, the time commitment made it impossible to continue as a facilitator: Just the reality of my situation and my time just didn't really make it feasible.</s>
          <s>Being away from home was also mentioned by several participants: It was difficult to be away during dinner time, the witching hour as some people call it... leaving my wife at home to go out and do this <ref type="bibr">[Brian]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Creating a positive learning environment in which all were equally engaged proved to be challenging at times.</s>
          <s>Brian suggested that some dads were probably coerced into being there: I really knew we had one or two participants who were probably there because their wife told them to and they weren't really interested.</s>
          <s>Damien shared how drawing out the quiet dads was a concern: Some would stay very quiet and some would not be too interested.</s>
          <s>Facing a session that didn't proceed as planned was described as exhausting but contributed to facilitators reflecting on how they could have responded differently: By the time I kind of left … I'm so exhausted after that … Things just weren't going my way and by the end of the session I was just, oh God I wish I could do that one over again (Alex).</s>

          <s>Not only was a personal loss felt but also a loss for the community which was described by Derek: It's a shame it can't continue forever I know, but it would be good for something similar to continue in some vein.</s>
          <s>Justin revealed his personal loss by stating his wish to be involved in any future projects: I'd like to still be involved with this sort of stuff...if there's any opportunity I'm happy to be contacted.</s>

          <s>Support for their peer facilitator role included the research team demonstrating availability, flexibility and understanding of personal issues that need to be considered when rostering them to FFAB class: they were understanding of my personal needs (Alex).</s>

          <s>I think they were very well accommodating of the team and they did seem to go out of their way to make sure that we were looked after (Derek).</s>
          <s>This was further demonstrated when the research team developed options of either flip chart or a PowerPoint presentation in response to issues with audio-visual equipment availability in some hospital settings: One of the good things was that they changed from doing … a PowerPoint presentation to actually doing a flip, a flip chart … being able to rock up and have everything ready to go, I felt a bit more in control (Justin).</s>

          <s>Generalisability cannot be assumed across different international or culturally unique contexts.</s>
          <s>However, we anticipate that readers may find the content, class activities and training process for the peer facilitators useful to inform development of a father-focused class that is tailored to their particular context.</s>
          <s>Interview questions to facilitators were focused upon their overall experiences; a direction for further study could be the inclusion of peer facilitators' perceptions of how participant fathers received the specific information discussed and what aspects they found most useful.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Breastfeeding education classes for fathers by fathers provided an interactive environment which assisted in understanding the value and importance of breastfeeding.</s>
          <s>Practical information and advice around providing breastfeeding support for their partners was important to fathers, including learning to deal with potential problems during the early weeks.</s>
          <s>Fathers also appreciated acknowledgement of their important role in the ongoing success of breastfeeding.</s>
          <s>Peer father facilitators valued being well prepared by program coordinators to lead the classes and for the ongoing support throughout their role in conducting the classes.</s>
          <s>The facilitators acknowledged the negative aspects of providing this service, such as the burden of ongoing commitment within their busy lives, however, felt these were outweighed by the positive aspects such as the sense of giving back to society.</s>
          <s>This process evaluation revealed that father-focused breastfeeding classes are a feasible and acceptable way of engaging fathers as breastfeeding supporters.</s>
