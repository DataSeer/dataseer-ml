            <s>IL-6 and IL-1β actions were blocked using IL-6 antibody (300 ng/ml) and IL-1β antibody (15 μg/ml), respectively.</s>
            <s>Potential anti-inflammatory effects of 1α,25(OH) 2 D 3 were investigated by pre-treatment and treatment of 1α,25(OH) 2 D 3 (0.01 to 10 nM) for 48 h in MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes.</s>
            <s>In parallel, western blotting was used to determine inflammatory signaling molecules including relA of the NF-κB pathway and p44/42 MAPK modified during these processes.</s>

          <p>
            <s>Results: MacCM enhanced the secretion and gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES by increasing the phosphorylation levels of relA and p44/42 MAPK in preadipocytes, whereas blocking IL-6 and IL-1β action inhibited the inflammatory responses by decreasing p44/42 MAPK and relA phosphorylation, respectively.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, 10 nM of 1α,25(OH) 2 D 3 generally inhibited the IL-6 and IL-1β-mediated inflammatory responses, and reduced both p44/42 MAPK and relA phosphorylation in MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes.</s>

          <s>Infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue induces metaflammation <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , which may contribute to metabolic syndrome <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the initial experiments, we treated human white preadipocytes with MacCM (25%) to elicit inflammatory responses.</s>
          <s cert="0.8266908526420593" id="dataset-7" type="Tabular data">Cytokine release was screened using proteome array and the results revealed that <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a</ref> , b) pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES were secreted from MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes, compared to controls.</s>
          <s>Surprisingly, IL-1β, which is vital in initiating and sustaining metaflammation in adipose tissue <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23]</ref> , was not detected.</s>
          <s>However, (Figs. 1c-g and 2) further ELISA results (unnormalized and normalized) show that besides IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES, the secretion levels of IL-1β were also markedly increased, but relatively lower, possibly too low to be detected by the array.</s>
          <s>In contrast, the secretion level of serpin was mildly decreased from MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes.</s>
          <s>Similarly, <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref> ) the qPCR results show that the mRNA levels of these pro-inflammatory factors were generally enhanced in MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes, especially IL-1β and IL-6, which were approximately 767 and 404-fold higher, compared to the control.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The plasma level of IL-6 is almost exclusively determined by whole-body adiposity and thus closely associated with metabolic syndrome <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, IL-6 has been found to stimulate the synthesis of C-reactive protein, which is one of the strongest indicators of metabolic risk <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence, we speculated that IL-6 might mediate inflammatory responses in MacCMstimulated preadipocytes.</s>
          <s>To test this, we blocked IL-6 action from MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes using IL-6 antibody.</s>
          <s>In preliminary work, a range of IL-6 antibody doses were tested based on calculations using the manufacturer's instructions, and (Additional file 1: <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. S1PA</ref> and S1PB) the results show that 300 ng/ml was the optimal dose to inhibit cytokine secretion and gene expression.</s>
          <s>In accordance with this, <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> the ELISA results (normalized) show that the secretion of IL-8 was considerably decreased by IL-6 antibody, which was 0.6-fold lower compared with MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes.</s>
          <s>Likewise, the levels of MCP-1 and RANTES were moderately decreased by 0.3-and 0.2-fold, respectively.</s>
          <s>Although the concentrations of IL-1β were numerically lower, this did not reach statistical significance.</s>
          <s>The secretion of IL-6 (and IL-1β later) is not presented, since additional IL-6 (IL-1β) antibodies in the supernatant will affect the accuracy of the ELISA results.</s>
          <s>Moreover, blocking IL-6 action exerted potent inhibitory effects on cytokine gene expression, <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref> ) as the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES were all significantly lowered by 0.4-to 0.7-fold.</s>
          <s>Therefore, IL-6 propagates and maintains inflammatory responses during adipose tissue metaflammation, since blocking IL-6 action inhibits the secretion and gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES in MacCM-stimulated preadipocytes.</s>
          <s>A recent study from our group demonstrated that IL-1β could target preadipocytes to induce adipose tissue metaflammation <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
