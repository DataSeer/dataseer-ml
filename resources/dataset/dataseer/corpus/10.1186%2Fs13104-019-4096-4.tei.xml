        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Smoking and alcohol intake are growing public health concerns.</s>
          <s>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are more than 1 billion users of tobacco worldwide, more than 80% of whom are males <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Africa in particular, the gap between male and female smokers is narrowing with more women smoking than before <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there are gender variations in the prevalence of smoking in different countries; in Malawi, a study has reported that more males (25.9%) compared to females (2.9%) are smokers <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, Malawi is one of the sub-Saharan African countries with a higher prevalence of smoking <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Concerning alcohol intake, WHO estimates almost 2 billion consumers, 76 million of whom are already experiencing alcohol use disorders <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The rate of alcohol consumption in Africa is predicted to be on the increase owing to the emergence of new consumers like young people and women <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has also been noted that the increase in alcohol consumption is high in underdeveloped countries and such increases are likely to hinder further development <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Malawi, a developing country in Africa, has little or no available information about alcohol consumption among its population.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Smoking and alcohol intake both have multiple causes.</s>
          <s>For tobacco use, some documented factors can be grouped into social and physical environmental factors such as religious activity, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, peer influences and cognitive decision-making factors about tobacco use and its consequences <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A study has also found parental smoking and the associated nicotine dependence as a risk factor for adolescent smoking <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, other studies have reported personality factors, cognitive factors, coping resources, family influences, media influences, tobacco availability, occupational stress, peer pressure and domestic stress as factors underlying smoking habits <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>For alcohol intake, a study has reported that the presence of high antisocial behavior, high impulsivity and high externality are factors related to alcohol dependence specifically for women <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Yet, another study has highlighted genetic risk factors, biological markers, childhood behaviors and psychiatric disorders to be associated to alcohol intake <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, some studies found that students who dropped out of high school were more than 6 times as likely to resort to alcohol use/abuse in adulthood.</s>
          <s>The studies thus concluded that education as well as race were associated with higher alcohol consumption behaviors <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Besides education, wealth index has been often cited as a factor related to smoking and alcohol consumption.</s>
          <s>In one study, an increased risk of drinking in wealthier individuals was found with a rather lower risk of smoking <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In another study, the rise in wealth inequity was independently associated with alcohol drinking problems only <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, not only is there uncertainty about factors driving smoking and drinking, literature on this topic is also limited especially in a developing country like Malawi with likely fewer and less paid jobs but larger families.</s>
          <s>It was thus necessary to investigate if satisfaction with job and family life has any connection with smoking and drinking behaviors among young men in Malawi.</s>

          <s>Prevalence of smoking and drinking across participants' characteristics are presented in <ref target="#tab_3" type="table">Table 2</ref> .</s>
          <s>Smoking and drinking was more prevalent among participants who ended their education at primary school level.</s>
          <s>While participants with the poorest household wealth were more likely to smoke, those with the richest household wealth were more likely to drink.</s>
          <s>Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis indicate that compared to men who were unemployed, those who were dissatisfied were <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">(Table 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, these findings were not statistically significant.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study examined the connection between satisfaction with job and family life and smoking and drinking among men in Malawi.</s>
          <s>Results show that when compared with those without a job, young men who had a job and were satisfied were relatively more likely not to resort to cigarette smoking.</s>
          <s>However, those who had a job but were dissatisfied were more likely to resort to smoking than those who were without a job.</s>
          <s>This finding is consistent with those of previous studies which found that the odds of smoking among those who were unemployed were greater compared to higher managers and professionals <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although the precise mechanism by which unemployment is related to smoking has not been well explored in studies, the possible role of psychosocial factors underlying this relationship such as one's inability to control emotions have been hinted <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Regarding the association of satisfaction/dissatisfaction with job and smoking, this study revealed that those who were dissatisfied with their job were more likely to smoke than those who were unemployed.</s>
          <s>This is also consistent with results of previous studies demonstrating that the impact of working conditions/job dissatisfaction is related with smoking <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>

          <s>Our study also revealed that dissatisfaction with overall family life was associated with higher smoking prevalence.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study observed no increase in drinking behavior related to unemployment but only changes in the drinking patterns.</s>
          <s>This is similar to observations from other studies arguing that unemployment does not lead to alcohol consumption <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, we found no significant relationship between drinking and overall satisfaction with life.</s>
          <s>However, it has be suspected that both dissatisfaction with life and unemployment are associated with low socio-economic status which might lead to actual reduction in drinking habit due in part to the economic situation <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>

          <s>Education and wealth status were consistently associated with both smoking and alcohol consumption.</s>
          <s>More educated participants were less likely to resort to both smoking and alcohol consumption.</s>
          <s>Previous studies have reported similar findings, with low education being noted as an independent risk factor for smoking and alcohol intake <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>

            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>With regards to wealth index and association with smoking and drinking behavior, non-linear relationships were observed.</s>
          <s>While the poorest are more likely to resort to smoking and alcohol consumption compared to the poor and middle-income individuals, the relationship changes when wealth index quintile improves; the rich and richest are more likely than middle income and poor household individuals to resort to smoking and drinking.</s>
          <s>Similar studies have reported these same findings <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31,</ref>
