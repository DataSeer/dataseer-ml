          <s>Human error is a major source of air traffic control (ATC) accidents or incidents <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>

            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Luo <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> showed that 74.3% of accidents related to ATC of China are caused by air traffic controllers, or controllers for simplicity, instead of ATC equipments.</s>
          <s>The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) indicated that the aviation accidents are closely related with the visual attention performance (VAP) <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The objective of the controller is to resolve flight conflicts and ensure flight safety management subject to dealing with a large amount of visual and auditory information and making decisions accurately, rapidly and stably <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When there is hazardous weather, communication failures and/or aircraft mechanical failures, controllers will commit unsafe acts which lead to human errors, like "error/mistake", "forgetting" and "omission".</s>
          <s>It is necessary for controllers to concentrate and allocate attention so as to avoid flight accidents or incidents <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The history of ATC shows that controllers' misidentification may cause severe aviation accidents or incidents.</s>
          <s>On 11th October 2016, a serious runway incursion incident during takeoff occurred because of the controller's erroneous operations in Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport of China <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This incident was due to controller's forgetting runway state and commanding mistake.</s>
          <s>It should be pointed out that there are two main factors for this incident: lapse of attention and lack of expertise as a novice in ATC.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A key issue for the cause of operational errors by novice controllers is the inadequate VAP <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the applied attention theory <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> , visual misidentification may occur due to individual factors and attentional slips.</s>
          <s>Visual misidentification usually engenders errors in visual detecting and searching.</s>
          <s>There are quite a number of references about human perception processing <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>

          <s>There are two categories of factors influencing VAP: extrinsic factors (EF), which refer to the impersonal factors that affect attention or the factors that are not related to individual and affect attention, and intrinsic factors (IF), which refer to the personal-related factors that affect attention.</s>
          <s>Our emphasis is put on the IF influencing VAP and their systematic assessment.</s>
          <s>The inadequacy of VAP may cause serious human errors in civil aviation.</s>
          <s>The descriptions of the EF influencing VAP are abundant such as budget of search, complexity of task, noise or dark environment <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21,</ref>

          <s>Moreover, these IF are conceptual and there is no quantitative method to analyze them mathematically.</s>
          <s>It is necessary to analyze the VAP quantitatively by converting the conceptual IF into the computational counterparts, i.e., intrinsic qualities (IQ).</s>
          <s>Intuitively and empirically, the controllers can be classified reasonably into four levels, i.e., excellent, good, moderate and unqualified.</s>
          <s>Theoretically, this classification can be implemented by clustering the features constructed from the IQ and evaluated with statistical inference.</s>
          <s>The determination of specific level which the control belongs to has a potential application in selecting air traffic controllers subject to detecting human errors and reducing the operation risk.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1. Modeling: Based-on the response sequences, the feature space is constructed with measurable parameters proposed for IF with psychological experiments, mathematical and statistical theories.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>2. Clustering: The ATC students characterized by the 2-dim or 3-dim features are classified via the K-means clustering algorithm automatically.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>3. Assessing: Different clusters are evaluated by statistical inference in order to control the risk of human errors in aviation safety management by selecting potential professionals of ATC.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In civil aviation, the clustering method has been successfully applied in intelligent classification of air traffic controllers <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> and aeronautical information network intrusion detection <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>On account of worldwide aircraft accidents between 1950s and 2010s, Christopher <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> and Olja <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> adopted the clustering method to predict the warning level of aircraft components and constructed an accident predictive models respectively.</s>

          <s>In 2013, Monechi <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> analyzed the interrelation of safety data with flight trajectories and network metrics.</s>
          <s>In 2017, anomalous flight operations are identified from energy-based metrics and clustering <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref> and Li et al. <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref>

            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref> studied the clustering and classification of IQ influencing the VAP of controllers.</s>

          <s>In this paper, we propose systematic assessment on individual's IF via the computational IQ by analyzing the response sequence with R/S analysis <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> , K-means clustering algorithm <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> and statistic inference so as to identify the relation of human error and information processing level specified by the IF.</s>
