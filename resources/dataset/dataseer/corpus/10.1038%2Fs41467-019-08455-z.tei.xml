            <s>Manipulation of grain boundaries in polycrystalline perovskite is an essential consideration for both the optoelectronic properties and environmental stability of solar cells as the solution-processing of perovskite films inevitably introduces many defects at grain boundaries.</s>
            <s>Though small molecule-based additives have proven to be effective defect passivating agents, their high volatility and diffusivity cannot render perovskite films robust enough against harsh environments.</s>
            <s>Here we suggest design rules for effective molecules by considering their molecular structure.</s>
            <s>From these, we introduce a strategy to form macromolecular intermediate phases using long chain polymers, which leads to the formation of a polymer-perovskite composite cross-linker.</s>
            <s>The cross-linker functions to bridge the perovskite grains, minimizing grain-to-grain electrical decoupling and yielding excellent environmental stability against moisture, light, and heat, which has not been attainable with small molecule defect passivating agents.</s>
            <s>Consequently, all photovoltaic parameters are significantly enhanced in the solar cells and the devices also show excellent stability.</s>

          <s>Since the first efficient solidstate perovskite solar cell was reported in 2012 <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , a lot of attempts to understand the photophysical properties of perovskites and to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite-based solar cells have been made.</s>
          <s>Recent improvements achieved via compositional <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> , morphological <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> , and interfacial engineering <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> have resulted in a rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of metal halide perovskite solar cells, making them a strong candidate to compete against the more welldeveloped inorganic semiconductors based on high-vacuum processes, such as silicon, gallium arsenide or copper-indiumgallium-selenide <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>

          <s>Manipulation of defective grain boundaries in polycrystalline perovskite films is crucial to maximize both the optoelectronic properties and stability of the film and the corresponding devices <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>The superior optoelectronic properties of single crystal perovskites over widely adopted polycrystalline perovskite thin films imply that grain boundaries play a critical roles on the optoelectronic properties of the film.</s>
          <s>For example, carrier diffusion lengths of single crystal perovskites and polycrystalline thin films are more than 100 μm and less than 10 μm, respectively, whereas trap densities for single crystal perovskites are between 10 9 and 10 10 cm −3 as compared to 10 16 to 10 18 cm −3 for polycrystalline thin film <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>The characteristic grain boundaries of the polycrystalline thin films were found to function as trap states and further act as vulnerable spots to trigger the degradation of the materials and its physical properties <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because metal halide perovskite films are deposited via solution processes and crystallizes at low temperatures, a lot of structural defects exist along the grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films.</s>
          <s>Grain boundaries that have dangling bonds can provide migration paths for ions and can become charge carrier trap centers and cause non-radiative recombination, which can significantly degrade charge carrier transport and the photophysical properties of the perovskite film <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, defective grain boundaries are more vulnerable to heat and moisture degradation which propagates inwards into the grain interiors from the boundaries to induce the physical and electrical decoupling of individual grains, thus reducing device performance.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is important for polycrystalline perovskite films to meet several requirements for optoelectronic applications: (1) high crystallinity and largesized crystal growth to minimize grain boundaries and structural defects at both grain interiors and boundaries, <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">(2)</ref> effective defect passivation at grain boundaries, and (3) cross-linking of individual crystal grains for high stability against harsh environmental stresses.</s>

          <s>The improved V OC and FF with EC and PC possibly originated from the reduced charge carrier recombination as confirmed by the PL studies.</s>

          <s>Most of the devices showed rapid initial decay followed by slower degradation with an almost linear profile, but the devices with PPC demonstrated a less severe initial decay.</s>
          <s>Given that the initial rapid decay can be related to the migration of ion and charged defects <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">47</ref> , the reduced initial decay regime can be attributed to a decreased charged defect density and an increased activation energy for ion migration as a result of the PPC-mediated crystallization.</s>

          <s>Furthermore, the addition of PPC slowed down the subsequent linear decay regime as well.</s>
          <s>From this, we extracted the T 80 (time with which the PCE decays to 80% of its initial value) from the post-burn-in regime (linear decay regime) for all the solar cells fabricated in this work and summarized this in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S4</ref> .</s>
          <s>All the calculated T 80 lifetimes of the devices with PPC were significantly elongated.</s>
          <s>Especially, the formamidinium-cesium-based solar cells with PPC decreased its initial decay to 1.8%, and after 500 h illumination, maintained 95.0% of initial PCE, from which the expected T 80 was approximately 10,800.1 h.</s>
          <s>The slower decay has been related to a permanent degradation of the perovskite layer accompanied by a chemical reaction and morphological change <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">51</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the inter-grain cross-linking of the perovskite, induced by the macromolecular intermediate phase, could very well have retarded the irreversible degradation of the perovskite as well.</s>

          <s>The polymer facilitated the formation of a long-range, molecularly ordered intermediate phase via a series of Lewis base adduct formations with the perovskite precursors.</s>
          <s>The formation of such a macromolecular adduct increased the activation energy for nucleation and diffusion of the precursor molecules, such that the subsequent perovskite films were fabricated with high crystallinity and significantly enlarged grains.</s>
          <s>Remnant polymeric Lewis bases in the perovskite films also effectively passivated the defect sites at the grain boundaries with high-binding energies.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the long-range ordering of the perovskite precursor molecules along the polymer backbone enabled inter-grain crosslinking to form a polymer-perovskite composite bridges between perovskite grains, which minimizes inter-grain electrical decoupling and greatly improved the stability of the perovskite films against harsh environmental conditions.</s>

A total of x mmol of EC or PC (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8) was added in the perovskite precursor solution. PPC was separately dissolved in DMF and added into the perovskite solution before spin coating for the polymermediated perovskite film. After 15 min UVO treatment, the perovskite solution was spin coated on glass/ITO/SnO 2 . A total of 0.3 mL of DE was dropped during spin coating (after 10 s) of the perovskite solution. The transparent adduct film was annealed at 65°C for 1 min, and then 100°C for 30 min. A spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated onto the perovskite film. Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared with the following composition: 85.8 mg of spiro-MeOTAD (1-Material), 33.8 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 19.3 μl of Li-TFSI (99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich, 520 mg mL −1 in acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). For the top electrode, 80 nm-thick Ag was thermally deposited at an evaporation rate of 0.5 A s −1 .</figDesc>
