        <p>
          <s>In the era of refractive cataract surgery, the achievement of a desired refractive outcome begins with intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation based on accurate biometry.</s>
          <s>The refractive status after cataract surgery is affected by various factors such as measurement error of the axial length (AL), measurement error of the corneal power, and the estimation of the pseudophakic anterior chamber depth (ACD) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Of these, AL measurement accounts for 54% of the sources causing error in the refractive outcome in cataract surgery <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>At present, the advent of partial interferometry (PCI) has reduced the effect of AL measurement errors by 36%, but ultrasonography (US) AL measurements still accounts for more than 50% of the total error in cataract surgery refraction results <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For many years, US had been the only technique used to measure AL in clinical practice <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> ; however, recently, the use of optical biometry has increased due to advantages pertaining to non-invasiveness and inter-operator reproducibility.</s>
          <s>Introduced in 1999, IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) is known to provide reliable measurements based on PCI with a 780-nm laser diode infrared light <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Introduced in 2009, the Lenstar LS 900 (Haag-Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland) is based on the principle of optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) using 820-nm super-light emitting diodes.</s>
          <s>Lenstar LS 900 provides measurements of AL, keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth, and white-to-white, as well as central corneal thickness, pupil size, and lens thickness <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the major limitation of these optical biometries is that measurement is impossible in patients with severe lens opacity.</s>
          <s>In previous studies, the AL measurement failure rates of PCI and OLCR in rural Chinese populations were reported as 37.84 and 35.47, respectively <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, accurate measurement of AL in patients with posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) remains a challenge <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The devices most recently introduced in clinical practice, e.g., Argos (Movu, Santa Clara, CA), IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany), OA-2000 (Tomey, Nagoya, Japan), and others, are optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems based on swept source (SS) and are currently receiving attention because of their high-tissue penetration power.</s>
          <s>Argos involves biometry combined with SS OCT, is noninvasive, and provides increased confidence by generating real-time 2D images of the whole eye (from cornea to retina) during alignment <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Compared to conventional optical biometry, Argos has approximately a 30-times higher-speed swept-source laser centered at 1060 nm and an improved signal to noise ratio, providing a high AL-measurement success rate and high image quality <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Most previous studies using SS-OCT have evaluated repeatability and reproducibility <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , and studies on IOL power calculations, which is the main reason why they were developed, have received relatively less attention.</s>
          <s>In addition, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of IOL power calculations measured by the SS-OCT biometer in eyes with PSC.</s>
          <s>The objectives of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements for IOL power calculation obtained with the SS-OCT biometer compared with conventional devices based on PCI feasibility.</s>

          <s>In the present study, the SS-OCT biometer showed a high acquisition rate of 97.68%, and the percentage of eyes with a PE of ±0.50 D or less was 71.09 and 72.22% in Group A and Group B, respectively.</s>
          <s>This is above the 55% value established as the benchmark standard by the National Health Service of the United Kingdom <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Various AL measurement failure rates have been reported so far due to methodological differences in clinical settings (e.g., patient's cataract type and severity, approach and version of the measurement device, and others).</s>
          <s>The AL measurement failure rates of IOLMaster have been reported to be 10-20% in previous studies <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>

            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> , but these studies did not classify cases according to grade of cataract density and morphology.</s>
          <s>A study which proposed cutoff values of cataract morphology and severity to measure AL has shown that IOLMaster v5.4 could not be used for measurements in cases of mature cataract and a LOCS ΙΙΙ P-scale value of 3.5 or higher <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The reason for such high AL measurement failure rate in PSC is that the location of opacity in the posterior pole is adjacent to the lens' nodal point and, accordingly, it affects more the passing of light rays compared to other types of morphology <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In clinical practice, PSC is known to cause visual disability regardless of the extent of opacity <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>

          <s>In this study, the AL measurement failure rate of Argos based on SS-OCT was 2.32%, which was similar to that reported in previous studies <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>

          <s cert="0.8810746073722839" id="dataset-12" type="Tabular data">In this study, AL was measured in the order of A-scan US, SS-OCT biometer, and PCI, but there was no statistical significance.</s>
          <s>It is known that US is reflected from the internal limiting membrane, while light in laser interferometry is reflected from the retinal pigment epithelium <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , which may result in difference corresponding to the retinal thickness in the fovea (130 μm).</s>

          <s>Therefore, we expected that there would be a significant difference in AL measurement between devices, but the results showed no significant difference.</s>
          <s>This result can be attributed to the fact that numerous individuals with normal axial length were included in this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although there was no significant difference in the biometric measurements among three devices, the SS-OCT biometer and PCI showed a lower MAE and a higher PE of ±0.50 D or less than the A-scan US.</s>
          <s>These results can be considered as a cause of the difference in the agreement of <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, Ueda et al. <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> reported that the IOLMaster's measurements were affected by cataract density but that the US was more affected in terms of accuracy.</s>
          <s>It is because in US the examiner estimates the location of the optical axis in the eye and performs a manual alignment, unlike optical biometry in which a more accurate alignment is guaranteed by using a visual axis while the patient stares at a light spot <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The main limitations of this study are as follows.</s>
          <s>First, we did not investigate other formulas (e.g., Haigis, Olsen, and Barrett Universal) using the SS-OCT biometer, although they provide additional measurements such as ACD or lens thickness.</s>
          <s>However, the comparison of formulas was not the purpose of this study.</s>
          <s>Second, although the immersion-type US is known to have better reproducibility, we used the applanation type because of the characteristics of the retrospective study.</s>
          <s>However, the A-scan US measurement was performed by an examiner with an experience of over 3 years, and AL measurements by applanation US obtained by experienced operators are reported to have less difference and lower variability in the difference compared to AL measurements obtained with IOLMaster <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>PCI has been regarded as an excellent noncontact measurement method in the eyes of cataract patients.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, US biometry is still required for cases with PSC <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>SS-OCT biometer and PCI There was no statistically significant difference in MAE between the SS-OCT biometer and PCI, but the measurement failure rate was lower for the SS-OCT biometer (2.32%) than for PCI (15.31%).</s>
          <s>Moreover, the SS-OCT biometer maintained the accuracy of the measurements for IOL power calculation without statistically significant difference from Group A in Group B. Whereas, A-scan US showed higher error than Group A in Group B. Thus, Using biometry with advanced OCT is useful in clinical practice as it is more effective in obtaining biometric measurements in the eyes with PSC and predictable refraction results compared to conventional devices.</s>
