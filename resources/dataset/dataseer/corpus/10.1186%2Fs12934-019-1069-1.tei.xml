            <s>Background: Salicylate can be biosynthesized from the common metabolic intermediate shikimate and has found applications in pharmaceuticals and in the bioplastics industry.</s>
            <s>While much metabolic engineering work focused on the shikimate pathway has led to the biosynthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds, little is known about how the relative expression levels of pathway components influence salicylate biosynthesis.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, some host strain gene deletions that improve salicylate production may be impossible to predict.</s>
            <s>Here, a salicylate-responsive transcription factor was used to optimize the expression levels of shikimate/salicylate pathway genes in recombinant E. coli, and to screen a chromosomal transposon insertion library for improved salicylate production.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Results: A high-throughput colony screen was first developed based on a previously designed salicylate-responsive variant of the E. coli AraC regulatory protein ("AraC-SA").</s>
            <s>Next, a combinatorial library was constructed comprising a series of ribosome binding site sequences corresponding to a range of predicted protein translation initiation rates, for each of six pathway genes (&gt; 38,000 strain candidates).</s>
            <s>Screening for improved salicylate production allowed for the rapid identification of optimal gene expression patterns, conferring up to 123% improved production of salicylate in shake-flask culture.</s>
            <s>Finally, transposon mutagenesis and screening revealed that deletion of rnd (encoding RNase D) from the host chromosome further improved salicylate production by 27%.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Conclusions: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the salicylate sensor-based screening platform to rapidly identify beneficial gene expression patterns and gene knockout targets for improving production.</s>
            <s>Such customized high-throughput tools complement other cell factory engineering strategies.</s>
            <s>This approach can be generalized for the production of other shikimate-derived compounds.</s>

          <s>It is worth noting that all six of the highest salicylateproducing mutants presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> (results from RBS library screening) show similar final titers, suggesting a potential "upper limit" to production, at least for this library and under these culture conditions.</s>
          <s>At least 40 mM glycerol remained in all cultures tested (data not shown), suggesting carbon supply does not limit production.</s>
          <s>The inhibitory effects of salicylate on growth of strain QH4 are notable even at 5 mM, and more severe as salicylate concentration increases (refer to Additional file 6).</s>
          <s>However, as noted above, salicylate titers do not exceed 5 mM until culture densities are already near maximum, and maximum culture density is not reduced as a result of increased salicylate production ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> and Additional file 4).</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, salicylate toxicity may contribute to an upper limit on production.</s>
