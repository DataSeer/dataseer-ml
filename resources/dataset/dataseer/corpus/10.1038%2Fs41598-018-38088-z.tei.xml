          <s>The robustness of the observed scaling laws across different sectors over many orders of magnitude provides compelling evidence that general dynamical principles, not specific to particular industries, govern the growth of firms.</s>
          <s>The analysis of 'new industries' illuminates growth dynamics at the early stages.</s>
          <s>The self-organization of the scaling behavior for new industries provides new, stronger evidence of universality in economic systems.</s>

          <s>Companies were sorted according to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).</s>
          <s>At the highest level, the economy is broken into "sectors".</s>
          <s>In specific cases, we show power law behavior from the sector level, down through the "industry group" and "industry" divisions.</s>
          <s>Several metrics for firm size can be used, such as sales, employees, etc.</s>
          <s>In the paper, we used the 'net sales' or revenue as the firm size, as is standard in the economic literature.</s>
          <s>We have conducted a similar analysis for employees and assets and the results are qualitatively similar to that for sales.</s>
          <s>These results are summarized for the manufacturing sector in <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>We analyzed the standard deviation of growth rates, R, versus initial size, S 0 .</s>
          <s>The log-log scale is chosen such that a straight-line plot on the log-log plot corresponds to a power law, and the slope of the line corresponds to the scaling exponent.</s>
          <s>We extract the exponent by running a regression on a log-log scale.</s>
          <s>For each plot, we pooled all the firms' initial sizes and yearly growth rates within a given industry or sector and over a given period of time.</s>
          <s>To compute the standard deviations for bins of growth rates, we used 20 bins when data is plotted at a sector level over the 'Original' and 'New' time periods.</s>
          <s>The 'Original' time corresponds to the same years as Stanley et al. <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> , whereas the 'New' time corresponds to all subsequent years.</s>
          <s>When analyzing new industries, we used 10 bins.</s>
          <s>We computed scaling exponents for 10, 20, and 30 bins for the manufacturing sector to verify that the computed exponents do not depend on the number of bins.</s>
          <s>These plots are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref> and the scaling exponents are reported in <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> .</s>

          <s>Using this method, we determined the power law scaling for fluctuations of the growth rates.</s>
          <s>As in Canning et al. <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> , we performed a check on the exponents calculated via the graphical approach by assuming a power law distribution for the standard deviations of the growth residuals with the functional form log σ(S 0 ) = log a-β log S 0 + γ(log S 0 ) 2 and employed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to calculate the scaling exponents <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>

          <s>We set γ = 0 to explicitly test the log linearity of the scaling relations.</s>
          <s>Fits showing the overlap between the graphical method and the MLE method are shown for the 'Information Technology' , 'Manufacturing' , 'Financials' , and 'Materials' sectors over the 'Original' and 'New' time periods in <ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref> .</s>

        <figDesc>Figure 1a,b are log-log plots of the standard deviation of one-year growth rates as a function of initial firm size for U.S. manufacturing firms over two time periods. Firm growth rate is defined as R = S 1 /S 0 , where S 1 and S 0 are consecutive annual measures of firm size. The two time periods are 1974-1993 ('Original'), which is the period Stanley et al. analyzed, and 1993-2015 ('New'). The standard deviation, σ(S 0 ), is fit to a power law of the form σ = β − S aS ( ) 0 0 , where a is a constant and β is the scaling exponent. For the Original time period β = 0.25 ± 0.02. For the New time period β = 0.26 ± 0.01. They are virtually identical to each other, and the results for the Original time period are not statistically significantly different from the 0.20 ± 0.03 reported by Stanley et al. for the same time period 4</figDesc>

      <note n="3" place="foot">. We analyzed the stability of the power law by using 5-year pooled regressions. For a given starting period, we pooled the yearly growth rates and initial sizes for all companies in that sector or industry for five subsequent years. This step is repeated by shifting the starting and end years by one. The data was pooled for five years as the year-to-year plots were noisy for smaller industries.</note>
