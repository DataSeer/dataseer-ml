        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>In 2012, approximately 213 million pregnancies occurred worldwide, of which 85 million (40%) were unintended.</s>
          <s>Half of these ended in induced abortions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>During this year, 7 million women who had induced abortions received lifesaving treatment for complications from unsafe pregnancy termination.</s>
          <s>This treatment, postabortion care (PAC), is a service package that addresses the emergency treatment and preventive health care needs of women experiencing complications from early pregnancy termination, both spontaneous and induced.</s>
          <s>This includes evacuation of residual products of conception from the uterus and family planning services (FP).</s>
          <s>The latter component of PAC includes discussion of postabortion fertility, optimal and desired timing of future childbearing after the evacuation procedure, contraception, and, if the client chooses, the actual provision of a contraceptive method.</s>
          <s>Over time, a holistic programming model was developed that includes community sensitization and mobilization to address demand-side barriers to access to PAC services <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In spite of global progress in this regard, estimates made by health professionals (averaged across several surveys conducted between 2000 and 2008) indicate that only 60% of women experiencing complications from abortion were expected to have accessed PAC, with the remaining two-fifths of women with postabortion complications not receiving such care <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It follows that unsafe abortion accounts for a sizeable proportion of all maternal deaths globally (8%), mostly in developing countries <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Strengthening contraceptive provision during PAC is critical, as it helps women to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce future incidence of unsafe abortion.</s>
          <s>Women seeking postabortion emergency care are particularly in need of contraceptive services: These clients are sexually active and at risk for subsequent pregnancy, not currently pregnant, and often highly desirous of avoiding childbearing.</s>
          <s>They are in contact with the health system, are often disinclined to return to the facility for a follow-up visit <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , and, according to global recommendations, are advised to delay a subsequent pregnancy for at least six months, for optimal health of the woman and her future newborn <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Fertility can return 1-2 weeks after vacuum aspiration of the uterus or medical treatment for abortion complications <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>All contraceptive methods are safe to use after PAC emergency treatment, whether it is performed medically, through uterotonic drugs, via vacuum aspiration, or surgically to remove residual products of conception.</s>
          <s>When treated medically, a PAC client may start using hormonal methods-including oral contraceptives, injectables, and implants-immediately after the onset of treatment, and an intrauterine device (IUD) may be placed when it is certain that the uterus is empty.</s>
          <s>After vacuum aspiration, all methods, including IUDs and implants, may be started immediately following a first-or second-trimester procedure.</s>
          <s>Only women who have had a septic abortion or evacuation with sharp curettage should wait until they are healed before having an IUD inserted, but they may start any other method of contraception.</s>
          <s>Providing voluntary methods at the time of PAC, rather than at a follow-up visit, increases contraceptive uptake and reduces future risk of unintended pregnancy <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, contraceptive services are an essential component of PAC.</s>
          <s>Various international technical working groups and organizations have concluded that a range of contraceptive methods, accurate information, counseling, and referral for ongoing care should be made available to women who have received PAC, and that this should start before they are discharged from a facility <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has offered guidance on high-impact practices for operationalizing these recommendations in health service delivery and management settings <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that women who receive PAC services that include FP have high contraceptive uptake <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Studies in developed and developing countries assessing facility-level interventions, such as providing contraception in the same location and the same time as PAC, show that offering a wide range of methods and using obstetric and midwifery staff to provide contraception improves overall uptake of a contraceptive method <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>

          <s>This paper describes the process and effects of expanding access to PAC, including postabortion FP services, in mainland Tanzania.</s>
          <s>The legal status of abortion in Tanzania is ambiguous: the penal code is broadly understood to authorize abortion to save a woman's life, but provisions for this, or allowance for it in the case of rape or incest, are not incorporated into national law that prohibits the practice.</s>
          <s>The lack of clarity creates confusion amongst providers and women who fear persecution, which, in turn, pushes women to seek abortion clandestinely.</s>
          <s>In 2013, women obtained just over 405,000 abortions, for a national rate of 36 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-49 and ratio of 21 abortions per 100 live births.</s>
          <s>For each woman treated for an induced abortion complication, 6 times as many had an abortion, but did not receive care <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MOHCDGEC), 19% of maternal deaths in Tanzania are due to abortion complications <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>From 2005 to 2014, the MOHCDGEC implemented facility-based, provider-focused, and community-level health system interventions to improve the accessibility and quality of PAC services, with technical assistance from EngenderHealth, an international nongovernmental organization.</s>
          <s>Global guidance on the design and delivery of PAC was tailored into implementation approaches that were contextually appropriate to the cultural, health care delivery, and broader environmental context of rural and peri-urban Tanzania, where this work was conducted.</s>
          <s>Between 2005 and 2014, the MOHCDGEC and health care providers in Tanzania decentralized PAC from tertiary-level district hospitals to primary health care dispensaries in four regions of the country, introducing the manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) treatment approach for PAC in all settings and scaling up the availability of PAC from 11 facilities in 2005 to 239 by 2013.</s>
          <s>PAC in this situation included provision of emergency uterine evacuation services (most frequently through MVA), immediate FP counseling and, if desired, provision of a contraceptive method, and linkages through referral to other reproductive health services.</s>

          <s>This analysis of PAC service delivery statistics, which were compiled in facility registers during this time period, has three following objectives.</s>
          <s>The first is to describe interventions used to increase access to, utilization of, and quality of PAC services during the period of decentralization.</s>
          <s>Second, it aims to examine results and factors that contribute to PAC clients' voluntary uptake of contraception.</s>

        <head>Description of PAC program development and interventions in Tanzania</head>
        <p>
          <s>In 2005, the MOHCDGEC initiated a pilot project in Geita District (then part of Mwanza Region 1 ) to demonstrate how to scale up PAC from district or referral hospitals to the level of intermediate health centers and primary-level dispensaries.</s>
          <s>The pilot comprised three elements: training service providers, setting up comprehensive PAC services and infrastructure, namely the establishment in each facility of an evacuation room where all clients admitted for routine complications from abortion (both spontaneous and induced) can receive counseling, removal of retain products in the uterus via vacuum aspiration and family planning services, including access to contraception.</s>
          <s>Of note, the evacuation methods available for clients in these settings was limited to MVA with occasional utilization of sharp curettage.</s>
          <s>Up to present, medication evacuation of the uterus, namely through misoprostol, is not permitted for PAC treatment as per MOHCDGEC policy in mainland Tanzania.</s>
          <s>Lastly, the model used to expand PAC coverage included community awareness raising and mobilization.</s>
          <s>For this, service providers, convened community meetings in their catchment communities during outreach events that centered on other primary health care issues.</s>
          <s>During these occasions, providers educated communities on complications from early termination of pregnancy and forged linkages with community health volunteers, whom educated them on FP and PAC and encouraged to convene community discussion groups on these issues.</s>
          <s>For clients that extended their permission to do so, volunteers would conduct home visits to former clients, during which they would counsel women on post-discharge self-care behaviors, FP and contraceptive methods.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Within Geita District, 11 facilities (the district hospital, seven health centers, and three dispensaries) were chosen for the pilot.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The expansion of PAC services was concentrated in Geita and three surrounding regions-Mwanza, Simiyu, and Shinyangaand received technical, implementation, and evaluation support from EngenderHealth and funding from USAID.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The scale-up of the PAC model followed vertical and horizontal strategies.</s>
          <s>The vertical strategy, which was implemented during 2007, involved efforts to institutionalize PAC.</s>
          <s>Critical to this was the promulgation of clinical guidelines for PAC, which established MVA as the optimal clinical technique, and legislation to permit task shifting of MVA to mid-level providers, including nurses and midwives.</s>
          <s>At this time, PAC was included in the National Package of Essential Health Interventions and MVA kits in the national essential drugs and supplies list.</s>
          <s>During this period, the MOHCDGEC also, importantly, adopted of a national PAC curriculum and training guidelines.</s>
          <s>The horizontal strategy was based on district-level decentralization of PAC coverage, from district hospitals to health centers and dispensaries, in the 16 districts that comprised the four regions.</s>
          <s>With assistance from EngenderHealth, participating districts conducted assessments to identify eligible lower-level sites and planned when to devolve PAC services.</s>
          <s>Trainings in the four regions ensued for assistant medical officers, nurse midwives, and nurses to deliver MVA.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Instruction and support for facilitative supervision was an important factor in ensuring the quality of services.</s>
          <s>With this, providers in management positions at scale-up facilities learned to facilitate the quality improvement methodology known as COPE® 2 , 3 which includes performance improvement checklists, questionnaires, and guidance on facilitating supportive supervision visits that promote development of corrective action plans in such areas as counseling, treatment procedure, infection prevention, and contraceptive services.</s>
          <s>Another important aspect of the decentralization of PAC services was the strengthening of monitoring systems.</s>
          <s>With support from EngenderHealth, the Government of Tanzania developed a PAC register that was gradually incorporated into existing health management information systems at the district-and ultimately the national-level.</s>
          <s>With this, the decentralization of PAC took place in phases in these 16 districts in Geita, Mwanza, Simiyu and Shinyanga.</s>
          <s>By 2014, PAC services eventually covered 239 sites: 15 hospitals, 67 health centers, and 157 dispensaries.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the levels of complications faced by women that reported to these facilities during this period, additional service statistics were compiled from registers in the obstetricalgynecological wards of higher-level facilities.</s>
          <s>These sites admitted women experiencing more severe complications from abortion (spontaneous or induced) than those of women that were transferred to the evacuation rooms, which had been established during the scale up of PAC.</s>
          <s>These complications included severe bleeding, hemorrhage, sepsis, shock and uterine perforation.</s>
          <s>To identify these cases, data collectors looked at records of clients' gestational age, considering any complication that occurred at or prior to 28 weeks gestation as abortion related.</s>
          <s>Data collectors identified 1525 cases of these complications, accordingly.</s>
          <s>The median timing of these complications was 14 weeks gestation (range was 2-24 weeks).</s>
          <s>Of these 848 were hemorrhage (56%), 433 were sepsis (28%), 146 were uterine rupture (10%) and 98 (6%) were not attributed to a particular cause.</s>
          <s>Because these data sources did not include information on contraceptive provision, in addition to the fact that above-described scale up of PAC did not emphasize treatment and FP services for women presenting with these severe morbidity, these cases were not included in the following analysis.</s>

          <s>The decentralization of PAC from tertiary hospital facilities to lower-level facilities proved to have effectively addressed the disproportionally high levels of utilization at the former by increasing the availability of the service in the latter.</s>

          <s>A global meta-analysis of postabortion FP behaviors in developing-country settings found that 47% of clients were above the age of 25 <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> ; this study finds the proportion of such clients in Tanzania to be somewhat greater (60%).</s>
          <s>The finding is consistent with those from more in-depth analyses of women's decision to continue with unintended pregnancies in high-income settings, which demonstrate that factors associated with relatively later phases in women's life cycle (including number of living children, marital status and cohabitation with partners, and years since last delivery) are determinants of induced abortion <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A detailed analysis of demographic surveillance data in Bangladesh supports the finding that higher maternal age, shorter birth intervals, and advanced parity are determinants of induced abortion; however, very young maternal age is also associated with a greater likelihood of pregnancy termination <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The univariate breakdown of the demographic characteristics of 18,688 PAC clients suggests, albeit illustratively, that in Tanzania, demand for PAC is prominent among women at all phases of the reproductive life course, mostly among those at advanced stages of parity.</s>

        <head>Trends of decentralization</head>
        <p>
          <s>Trends in the utilization of PAC services at the 120 facilities indicate that, by 2010,the scale-up resulted in an increase in utilization of PAC, mostly at lower-level facilities.</s>
          <s>This reflects a promising departure from earlier patterns of disproportionally high levels of service utilization at regional and district hospitals.</s>
          <s>A deeper look at decentralization trends, illustrated in our findings section, however, illuminates challenges in shifting treatment seeking for PAC to the primary care level, which is typically closest to communities where women first identify their need for care.</s>
          <s>This finding may be contextually specific to the local health system in the Lake Zone of Tanzania during this period.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the challenge we observed promoting treatment seeking for PAC at dispensaries is consistent with results of other efforts to scale up "high-impact practices" at the primary care level.</s>
          <s>Altogether this points out the need for continuous strengthening of overall health systems that promotes local government coordination, and improves supply chains, training and supervision systems, particularly at the primary care level, manpower and logistics problems are often the most acute <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is encouraging, however, that the delivery of postabortion contraceptive services remained an integral component of the PAC model during scale-up.</s>
          <s>Similar experiences have been recorded in other settings, such as in Guatemala <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[27]</ref> and in sites supported by Ipas in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which reported high levels of FP uptake over similar time frames <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Though our analysis adds to an emergent body of literature on uptake of modern contraception immediately after PAC, the evidence on long-term postabortion contraceptive continuation remains thin and inconclusive <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28,</ref>

        <head>Factors associated with postabortion contraceptive uptake by PAC clients</head>
        <p>
          <s>This analysis suggests that the efforts described in this paper contributed to high contraceptive uptake in an environment of low contraceptive prevalence <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While encouraging, this study illuminates priorities for future interventions to improve uptake through increased method choice and access.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Overall, uptake of LARCs and PMs is relatively low in the observed sites, particularly among younger women.</s>
          <s>In Tanzania, the contraceptive method mix is limited by commodity availability in the public sector.</s>
          <s>For example, implants and IUDs are not always available in lower level facilities, especially frontline dispensaries.</s>
          <s>These service delivery points also face critical shortages in staff competent at inserting and removing these methods.</s>
          <s>This can influence providers to prefer delivering short-acting methods <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Conversely, other studies report that women prefer short-acting contraception regardless of the availability of a wide method mix in settings where they seek care <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, it stands to reason that if the full range of methods were available at all sites, along with providers trained to deliver them, this could increase uptake among PAC clients, generate demand among new users, and allow PAC clients to choose the contraceptive method best aligned with their fertility intentions <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted odds of adopting any modern method or an LA/PM among all of the clients recorded in PAC registers in the 120 sites observed.</s>
          <s>After conducting regression diagnostics, we elected to report on tests adjusted for clustering by site <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">(Tables 2 and 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We learned that postabortion uptake of any modern method increased with age with the exception of clients age 35 and older, who were significantly less likely to adopt a modern method relative to clients under 20.</s>
          <s>Conversely, the adjusted odds of PAC clients' adoption of an LA/PM increased incrementally according to age, with PAC clients aged 35 and older the most likely to adopt these contraceptive methods.</s>
          <s>While the associations between age progression and adoption of LA/PMs are consistent with existing knowledge, the negative odds of adopting any modern method among women of advanced age, relative to the youngest women, is at variance with findings from recent studies <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This association merits further investigation specific to the service provision, fertility, and method preferences of PAC clients in Tanzania.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As has been observed in other studies, the odds of postabortion uptake of any modern method in our analysis were significantly greater in primary and intermediate facilities than in hospitals <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This trend was reversed when the analysis was narrowed to uptake of LARCs/PMs, which PAC clients were significantly more likely to adopt at tertiary facilities.</s>
          <s>Sterilization services, IUD, and implant services require equipment, commodities, and clinical skills that are, frequently, not available at lower level facilities.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, relative to hospitals, health centers and dispensaries receive fewer clients, availing providers more time to counsel clients on fertility awareness and contraceptive methods.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, they are smaller, and rarely require complex internal referrals.</s>
          <s>Future improvements should address these imbalances.</s>
          <s>For example, by reorganizing services at higher-level facilities and by training and motivating providers there to deliver quality, client-centered postabortion counseling, it is likely that programs would facilitate improvements in provision of FP methods during treatment of abortion complications.</s>
          <s>Similarly, training mid-level providers to deliver IUD, implant, and sterilization services, in addition to uterine evacuation, would improve the availability and quality of services at primary care facilities, leading to more even levels of PAC utilization at higher-and lower-level facilities, respectively <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The adjusted odds of adopting any modern contraception were significantly greater among PAC clients who received MVA.</s>
          <s>Similarly, the likelihood of modern method uptake was significantly less among PAC clients admitted for treatment beyond 12 weeks of gestation.</s>
          <s>The same associations were observed when the analysis was narrowed to looking at PAC clients' uptake of LA/ PMs.</s>
          <s>It bears noting that 94% of all sharp curettage cases and 87% of all PAC cases admitted after 12 weeks of pregnancy occurred at hospitals.</s>
          <s>This suggests that the challenges in delivering postabortion FP services at advanced gestational stages, or when MVA is not used, may stem from problems with the service delivery environment in hospitals, as discussed above and in recent literature <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The analysis presented was undertaken post-hoc to capture the results of the PAC decentralization program in Tanzania.</s>
          <s>Poor collection of PAC service statistics before the intervention precluded us from comparing pre-and post-intervention results.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, it is possible that data collection was poorly conducted at the enrolled sites by the providers who recorded service statistics.</s>
          <s>PAC logbooks did not capture critical information related to clients' decision to adopt a contraceptive method.</s>
          <s>This included their fertility intentions, their prior experience of an abortion, the time since their last pregnancy and delivery, the quality of care, and other contextual factors known to influence women's contraceptive calculus at all stages in their reproductive lives.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, they do not include information on spousal involvement in FP counseling or whether a spouse/ partner adopted FP after PAC.</s>
          <s>We also only included women served at the public-sector facilities where EngenderHealth provides technical assistance.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The experience of expanding PAC services in Tanzania suggests that integrating contraceptive care with treatment for abortion complications can increase FP use.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, it illustrates how the integrated service delivery model can remain effective during scale-up.</s>
          <s>These findings are in keeping with the evidence that has led to global recognition of PAC as a high-impact practice <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Yet there are numerous examples of international and country-level policies that undermine efforts to help women realize their reproductive intentions and protect their health, particularly after an unsafe abortion <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Where policies are enabling, this may be undermined by weak health systems and implementation capacity to address the particular needs of PAC clients who have expressed a demand for FP.</s>
          <s>Thus, there are opportunities to apply the experience reported in these pages to the effect of increasing contraceptive access and choice to women in this situation.</s>
          <s>If implemented methodically and at scale, this may strengthen systems and make gains against preventable maternal mortality <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Method choice and uptake in postabortion settings is influenced by a range of factors related to clients' socio-demographic characteristics, their individual preferences, their familial and social context, provider knowledge and attitudes, the strength of local health systems, and population policies.</s>
          <s>Only some of these could be examined in this analysis; much remains to be understood from research that can draw upon richer data sources than routine service statistics.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, it is clear that by collaborating with governments, organizations can foster critical change.</s>
          <s>If partners work together, with a vision of reorganizing services, increasing access to new methods at all levels of care, training providers, and strengthening management systems, they can effectively reposition FP and address unmet need and its adverse sequelae on postabortion women, both in Tanzania and in other settings where the need for such interventions is acute.</s>
