          <s>Older adults constitute the fastest-growing population of kidney diseases.</s>
          <s>Among individuals aged ≥65 years, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a rather common disease, which affects 35% to 44% of the older people <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1,</ref>

          <s>Mounting evidence has indicated that the elderly are at higher risks for CKD occurrence and progression, and early progressive renal function decline contributes to multiple serious adverse events, including cognitive impairment, end-stage kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and death <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, timely recognition of those older people at-risk for early renal function decline provides opportunities for prevention and treatment of adverse outcomes <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>Traditional approach using a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 57% or greater) to document renal progression is a late event which precludes timely intervention <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>A lesser reduction (≥30%) of eGFR over 2 years is a novel validated definition for early renal function decline and has been positively acknowledged as a surrogate endpoint of end-stage renal disease in clinical research <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

          <s>These non-traditional factors could also result in renal deterioration and attenuate the contribution of hyperuricemia.</s>

          <s>Although Mendelian randomization is a valuable tool by using genetic variants as instrumental variables to test the causal relationship between SUA and eGFR change, this approach presumes that the genetic instruments should have strongly association with SUA levels, affect outcome solely through SUA, and have no association with known confounders <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>The validity of genetic instruments was only partly verified in Hughes' study and potentially influenced the association between SUA and renal function <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>It should be also noted that the cohort analyzed by Hughes et al. <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">32</ref> were younger than ours.</s>
          <s>Clearly, further large-scale studies are still required to disentangle the causal mechanism between hyperuricemia and renal dysfunction.</s>
