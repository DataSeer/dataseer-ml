        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Severe anaemia is a common health problem among children, accounting for 10-29% of all paediatric admissions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> and about 8-17% of hospital deaths in sub-Saharan Africa <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Uganda, 11% of children under five years are anaemic <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The biological causes of paediatric severe anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa have been widely documented as being complex and multi-factorial, involving malaria, micronutrient deficiencies, viral agents and sickle cell anaemia <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the perception, which encompasses knowledge and beliefs of paediatric severe anaemia among local African communities, has received little attention, and therefore a limited understanding of how local perceptions are related to clinical diagnoses and how local beliefs influence treatment seeking behaviours exists.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is evidence to suggest that community perception of disease or illness and their interpretation (including the names used to describe it), are closely linked to supernatural, societal and biological elements <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Anthropologist Arthur Kleinman has presented a theoretical model for understanding health care systems derived from the way people react to sickness in local social and cultural settings as well as how they perceive, label or name, explain, and treat sickness <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to Kleinman, people's health beliefs and behaviours are governed by cultural rules and systems.</s>
          <s>Thus, culture establishes general criteria that guide the therapeutic process and how people evaluate the outcomes.</s>
          <s>Our study of local perceptions of severe anaemia draws insight from this model.</s>
          <s>We find it informative in exploring the cultural beliefs and attitudes of the community about severe anaemia and its causes and how these aspects might influence their health seeking behaviours.</s>
          <s>This study therefore explored the perceptions of pediatric severe anaemia, including knowledge about its presentation, perceived cause, and treatment among caregivers as well as local community members in three regions of Uganda.</s>

          <s>Training of research assistants was conducted during which data collection tools were translated into the local languages prior to data collection.</s>

          <s>The disease was attributed to multiple causes, and medical pluralism is practiced in its treatment.</s>

          <s>There were no further clues despite probing for the local name of the disease:</s>

          <s>I think the terminology remains the same, [that the child has lost blood]" (IDI 01_ Masaka).</s>

          <s>However, these terms were unanimously rejected by fellow community members during discussions as misleading since they meant different diseases.</s>
          <s>The FGD participants clarified that the first two terms refer to severe acute malnutrition in Buganda and Busoga regions respectively, while the latter is a local name for neonatal jaundice in Buganda region.</s>

          <s>To describe the process or mechanisms of severe anaemia, local terms that refer to 'sucking blood' such as in the case with evil spirits or 'draining the blood out of the child', such as in the case of splenomegaly were used interchangeably.</s>

          <s>Their interpretation of poor feeding was not eating a balanced diet, eating cold food, such as leftovers, and eating 'dirty food', all of which were attributed to parental negligence.</s>

          <s>"Even poverty causes severe anaemia" (R5_FGD2_Masaka).</s>
          <s>"The way he used to feed when he was staying with his mother was different from the way I am feeding him now.</s>
          <s>So I think that it could be the poor feeding; because since his childhood he had never suffered from severe anaemia-that was the first time."</s>
          <s>"She (child's mother) brought him to the village (to me) and the situation changed.</s>
          <s>I have many children; I cannot manage to fulfil the way he was feeding" (IDI 02_ Jinja).</s>

          <s>Splenomegaly.</s>
          <s>Splenomegaly, in addition to being perceived as a sign of severe anaemia, was a dreaded cause of severe anaemia that was perceived as draining blood out of a child even to death, if not treated.</s>
          <s>These beliefs were found in all three regions, but were strongest in Buganda, followed by Busoga.</s>
          <s>The local terms used to describe splenomegaly were; 'ekikubuuko', 'akabengo' and 'ekibaale' among the Baganda, Basoga and Banyoro tribes respectively.</s>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Most community members believed that an enlarged spleen sucks blood directly from the heart, and that is caused by either malaria or high fever, but one elderly interviewee explained it to be caused by breast milk spilling from the mother's opposite breast onto the baby's abdomen during nursing.</s>

          <s>They believed an enlarged spleen was likely to be 'female' if located in the lower part of the abdomen (large) and if it responded quickly to local treatment; while a 'male one' is located in the upper part, and poorly responds to treatment: "They say it is brought about by fever; that state when the child is very hot" (R2_FGD1-_Masaka).</s>

          <s>Nevertheless, evil spirits were suspected to be the cause of severe anaemia if: the child does not improve on formal treatment and blood transfusion, if no cause for the severe anaemia was readily known or not communicated to them, if child with severe anaemia died suddenly, if severe anaemia became recurrent or when one of the signs on the child was a temperature difference between the torso and legs, as illustrated by the following quotes:</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Evil spirits were categorized into four groups: 'amayembe' (demons), 'ekitega' (another kind of demon), 'misambwa' (fallen angels), and 'magiini' (coastal spirits that manifest as humans).</s>
          <s>'Ekitega' were regarded as the most efficient at sucking blood.</s>

          <s>This study used in-depth interviews of primary caregivers of children treated for severe anaemia and complemented the IDIs with FGDs with mothers from the community to study local perceptions of childhood severe anaemia in Uganda.</s>
          <s>Because perceptions influence health care-seeking behaviours, a better understanding of the knowledge and beliefs regarding severe anaemia is important for effective community-based health interventions.</s>
          <s>We explored the local names for severe anaemia, what caregivers considered important signs/symptoms, and the perceived severity of the disease and its causes.</s>
          <s>The results of our study suggest that the community's understanding of severe anaemia to a large extent align with known clinical signs and biological causes.</s>
          <s>However, the existence of negative local beliefs, such as those in evil spirits can potentially undermine the benefits of such local knowledge and hinder appropriate healthcare seeking for paediatric severe anaemia in Uganda.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Although severe anaemia is a relatively common and well-known disease among children, our findings suggest that in select central, eastern and western communities of Uganda, there is no common local name for severe anaemia; rather the disease is understood in context, as 'loss of blood', 'lack of blood' or 'having no blood'.</s>

          <s>For example, among the Luo speaking communities in northern Uganda cervical cancer is named "two remo"referring to an illness that manifests with bleeding <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> , and in some ancient European societies, epilepsy was named "morbus sacer" referring to a demoniac condition <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The lack of a specific term for severe anaemia may be a result of inadequate vocabulary in many local languages.</s>
          <s>Having no name by which a disease is known by the local community may have negative consequences for the management of that disease by lay people.</s>
          <s>In the current study we found a mis-classification of severe anaemia as severe acute malnutrition.</s>
          <s>This was possibly due to the absence of a specific name to describe severe anaemia.</s>
          <s>Another possible explanation for this finding of having no name might be related to the revelation that community members perceived severe anaemia to be a consequence of another underlying condition, such as poor feeding or malaria.</s>

          <s>We found many knowledge gaps about prevention of paediatric severe anaemia, with most community members expressing the opinion that no action was needed to protect 'their healthy children'.</s>

          <s>The study design omitted interviews from opinion makers and cultural leaders, whose views might be insightful.</s>
          <s>However, the views of such individuals are one-step removed from those with primary responsibility for the care of children with severe anaemia.</s>
          <s>This study mainly focused on mothers and recruited 75% interviewees and 100% FGDs as mothers; because they are most often the primary caregivers of children.</s>
          <s>However, in a typical African setting, fathers who were less represented here also make many of the health care decisions <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The Ugandan policy and public health workers need to pay attention to how community perceptions about severe anaemia influence caregivers' response to this condition, and design appropriate messages on early detection, appropriate treatment and prevention.</s>
          <s>In addition, community sensitization addressing misperceptions such as those related to splenomegaly, jaundice and local beliefs in evil spirits represent important targets for improvement in paediatric severe anaemia care.</s>
