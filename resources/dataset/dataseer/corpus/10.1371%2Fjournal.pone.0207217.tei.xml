            <s>When estimating psychometric functions with sampling procedures, psychophysical assessments should be precise and accurate while being as efficient as possible to reduce assessment duration.</s>
            <s>The estimation performance of sampling procedures is commonly evaluated in computer simulations for single psychometric functions and reported using metrics as a function of number of trials.</s>
            <s>However, the estimation performance of a sampling procedure may vary for different psychometric functions.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the results of these type of evaluations may not be generalizable to a heterogeneous population of interest.</s>
            <s>In addition, the maximum number of trials is often imposed by time restrictions, especially in clinical applications, making trial-based metrics suboptimal.</s>
            <s>Hence, the benefit of these simulations to select and tune an ideal sampling procedure for a specific application is limited.</s>
            <s>We suggest to evaluate the estimation performance of sampling procedures in simulations covering the entire range of psychometric functions found in a population of interest, and propose a comprehensive set of performance metrics for a detailed analysis.</s>
            <s>To illustrate the information gained from these metrics in an application example, six sampling procedures were evaluated in a computer simulation based on prior knowledge on the population distribution and requirements from proprioceptive assessments.</s>
            <s>The metrics revealed limitations of the sampling procedures, such as inhomogeneous or systematically decreasing performance depending on the psychometric functions, which can inform the tuning process of a sampling procedure.</s>
            <s>More advanced metrics allowed directly comparing overall performances of different sampling procedures and select the best-suited sampling procedure for the example application.</s>
            <s>The proposed analysis metrics can be used for any sampling procedure and the estimation of any parameter of a psychometric function, independent of the shape of the psychometric function and of how such a parameter was estimated.</s>
            <s>This framework should help to accelerate the development process of psychophysical assessments.</s>

          <s>Estimating psychometric functions is an important topic, both in basic psychophysics research to investigate mechanisms of sensation and perception, but also in clinical assessments to diagnose sensory deficits, e.g., after neurological injuries.</s>
          <s>A psychometric function relates physical stimuli to the perception, respectively performance, of the subject in detection and discrimination tasks <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In order to estimate a psychometric function, stimuli of different magnitudes (also referred to as levels) have to be presented to the subject, who then has to rate the stimuli according to the paradigm used in the experiment (e.g., yes-no, same-different, reminder or two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The term sampling procedure usually encompasses a set of rules with procedure-specific parameters defining the levels and order of the presented stimuli.</s>
          <s>There exist many different sampling procedures.</s>
          <s>The classical sampling procedure is the method of constant stimuli (MOCS) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> presenting stimuli at predefined (i.e., fixed-grid) levels spanning the perception range of interest.</s>
          <s>While this sampling procedure can be used to obtain the entire shape of the psychometric function, adaptive sampling procedures have been developed to quantify only specific features of a psychometric function (e.g., the perception threshold or slope of a sigmoidal psychometric function) (see <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> for reviews).</s>

          <s>An ideal sampling procedure should be precise and accurate (i.e., present low inherent method variability and be unbiased) to guarantee a high assessment reliability.</s>
          <s>In addition, sampling procedures should be as efficient as possible (i.e., low number of required trials to achieve a wanted precision) as, especially in clinical settings, time is scarce and costly (e.g., <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[21]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Thus, often, the number of trials is strictly limited due to time constraints or because lengthy experiments could be detrimental for the subject's attention and lead to mental fatigue <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Resulting time-dependent alteration of perception (i.e., drift of psychometric functions) can lead to misestimations of parameters <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref>

            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, depending on the application scenario, the inter-subject variability may differ and prior knowledge on the distribution of the population of interest may be available or not.</s>
          <s>As a consequence, different values for the sampling procedure-specific parameters of adaptive sampling procedures defining the stimulus levels to be presented (e.g., around the threshold) may be needed for rapid convergence towards desired features of the psychometric function.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the question arises how sampling procedures and how sampling procedure-specific parameters should be selected for best performance in a specific application scenario.</s>

        <p>
          <s>As evaluating the performance of sampling procedures through a series of behavioral studies would be too time consuming, computer simulations offer a valuable alternative and powerful tool to simulate psychophysical experiments and to evaluate different sampling procedures and sampling procedure-specific parameters.</s>

          <s>To quantify the efficiency of a sampling procedure, a metric called sweat factor was proposed <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The sweat factor is defined by the product of the variance of the estimates and the number of trials, in order to evaluate the relative benefit of a longer procedure (i.e., more trials) for a reduced measurement error.</s>
          <s>Various other approaches and metrics have also been proposed to evaluate the performance of sampling procedures.</s>
          <s>They commonly include, for example, mean or bias (e.g., <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">37]</ref> ), standard deviation (e.g., <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">35]</ref> ), or settling accuracy (e.g., <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">20]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Others have additionally used information gain in bits <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[35]</ref> or percentage usable <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, these performance metrics are commonly used as a function of the number of trials, which may not be the factor which can be acted upon in many application scenarios due to limited time for assessments.</s>
          <s>When calculated for one given maximum number of trials, the sweat factor's information content is actually confined to the variability and cannot provide additional information.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, many simulations sample only one or a very limited number of threshold or slope parameter values <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8,</ref>

            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a matter of fact, the outcome for those metrics may depend on the actual parameter values (e.g., threshold and slope) of the psychometric function to be estimated, and performance may not be homogeneous across this parameter space.</s>
          <s>Thus, performance results are very likely not representative for other psychometric functions of the population of interest.</s>
          <s>Instead, constraining the simulations to a specific number of trials given by the requirements of the application and exploring the estimation performance for different psychometric functions covering the entire threshold/slope parameter space of the population would provide relevant insight when selecting and optimizing a sampling procedure for a specific application.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The aim of this paper is to take an application-driven approach and introduce an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics to analyze psychophysical procedures in terms of threshold and slope estimation performance.</s>
          <s>We suggest to use error measures widely used in motor control and learning studies <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[39]</ref> in order to describe bias and variability, and introduce percentage within bounds (PCTw/iB) curves, a practical measure depending on desired estimation tolerances which can be directly related to application requirements.</s>
          <s>Based on this concept, the normalized area under the curve (nAUC), spanning a surface in a specific threshold-slope parameter space, can be computed.</s>
          <s>With the normalized volume under the surface (nVUS) and the inhomogeneity σ, we propose measures to compare the performance across different procedures or settings.</s>

          <s>Before calculating the slope estimation error in the same way, an arctan(Slope α )/(π/2) transform was applied <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>In this application example and given the chosen parameters of the sampling procedures, PEST provides the best overall threshold estimates (i.e., highest nVUS), as visible in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 16.</ref> Yet, the PSI method and the accelerated SA Staircases perform similarly well to PEST and distinctively better than the other sampling procedures.</s>
          <s>This can be confirmed in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 12</ref> showing the tolerance-dependent estimation performance.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the accelerated SA Staircases performs better than, for example, the Weighted Up-Down method, despite large VE and increased bias (CE) for high thresholds, whereas the latter shows more constant performance across the threshold parameter space <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">(Fig 7)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These high threshold VE oscillations (appearing for both SA Staircases) exist only for thresholds larger than the start level and may arise from the asymmetric descending and ascending step sizes.</s>
          <s>A similar, yet not so strong, effect can be noticed for PEST.</s>
          <s>Since with the logarithmic version of PEST steps become larger when ascending towards higher levels, it requires more trials to converge towards a threshold with the same precision.</s>
          <s>However, as the number of available trials is limited by administration time requirements of this application, variability of the estimates increases.</s>
          <s>Thus, a recommendation to improve the performance of these three procedures would be to select a higher start level and converge towards the threshold with descending steps.</s>
          <s>The reason for the Weighted Up-Down method not showing such decreases in performance for high thresholds, in contrast to the other adaptive methods, may be the constant step size which is well chosen with regards to the parameter space of the simulated templates.</s>
          <s>Unsurprisingly, the estimation performance of MOCS shows ripples in both CE and VE <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">(Figs 6 and 7)</ref> .</s>
          <s>This reflects the limited number of different stimulus levels and presentations leading to equal estimations of psychometric functions for similar templates creating error ripples depending on the threshold.</s>
          <s>Both MOCS and the PSI method present increased VE at the boundary of the parameter space (i.e., high thresholds).</s>
          <s>This is attributable to the boundaries of the grid-like stimulus levels and the grid of psychometric functions used for the posterior probability distribution of the PSI method.</s>
          <s>As, for example, in the case of MOCS, the maximum stimulus level presented is 9˚.</s>
          <s>If the threshold of the template to be estimated is higher than this maximum level, there is no data at levels with high performance available for the Maximum Likelihood fit of the psychometric function.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, each level is presented only five times, resulting in a discretization of the proportions of correct responses with steps of 0.2.</s>
          <s>This is not sensitive enough to properly estimate the psychometric function just based on data from low performance levels.</s>
          <s>Thus, to improve MOCS and the PSI method for this application, the threshold grids should be expanded beyond the parameter space, which would resolve the issues at the boundary.</s>
          <s>Across all sampling procedures, the threshold estimation performance decreases when the psychometric functions to be estimated have a small slope.</s>
          <s>This is an inherent problem of psychophysical assessments, as a slowly rising psychometric function increases uncertainty and thus introduces higher variability in answers.</s>
          <s>Moreover, it becomes more difficult for threshold tracking methods to converge towards the threshold.</s>
          <s>Therefore, all sampling procedures perform poorly for small slopes, as visible in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 10.</ref>
          </s>
          <s>While PEST, accelerated SA Staircases, and the PSI method perform similarly well in estimating thresholds, the PSI method outperforms the other methods in estimating the slope of Performance metrics for psychophysical sampling procedures the psychometric function <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Figs 16 and 13</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The PSI method was also in particular developed to estimate both threshold and slope <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, this sampling procedure places the stimulus levels in a way to optimize the estimation of both parameters (i.e., also at levels of high and low percentage of correct responses).</s>
          <s>This is also reflected in the "jumps" of the stimulus levels of the sequence example shown in <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">Fig 5.</ref> However, it should be noted that, when choosing new stimulus levels, the PSI method can take advantage of using the parametrized psychometric function, which in simulations often follows the same parametrization as the psychometric function generating the responses (i.e., the psychometric function to be sampled).</s>
          <s>As a consequence, the PSI method might have an advantage that may result in artificially inflated performance.</s>
          <s>To test how much the results are affected, the presented metrics framework could again be used.</s>
          <s>In contrast to the PSI method, the other adaptive methods (in particular PEST and both SA Staircases) show faster asymptotic behavior towards the threshold to be estimated.</s>
          <s>The exploration of the stimulus levels with the latter sampling procedures depends solely on the selected start level and the initial step size, and is thus not optimized to cover a wide range of the psychometric function.</s>
          <s>The accelerated SA Staircases procedure is more aggressive than the standard version (because the denominator in the equation for calculating the new level is smaller, resulting in larger steps) and thus leads to more oscillations around the threshold, which helps to estimate the slope.</s>
          <s>Therefore, if the slope is of interest, a sampling procedure which places trials at well separated levels should be used <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, if the differences between the levels are too large in comparison to the slope (which can be the case for MOCS and the Weighted Up-Down method if sampling procedure-specific parameters are not well chosen), steep slopes are difficult to estimate because the sampling procedure may not place levels in the "slope region" of the psychometric function.</s>
          <s>In addition, due to its non-adaptiveness (i.e., predefined and fixed stimulus levels), MOCS places too many trials in regions of little information content (i.e., of very low and very high percentage of correct responses) ( <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">Fig 5)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Besides the proportion of correct responses suffering from low resolution, these trials do not significantly contribute to the Maximum Likelihood fit of the psychometric function, as by definition of the psychometric function ψ(x) the asymptotic values are already defined (i.e., 0.5 and 1).</s>
          <s>Thus, depending on whether the slope of the psychometric function to be estimated is small or steep, non-adaptive and adaptive fixed-grid-level procedures (e.g., MOCS, Weighted Up-Down) may perform better than threshold tracking procedures (e.g., PEST, standard and accelerated SA Staircases), and vice versa, as can be inferred from <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig 11.</ref>
          </s>
          <s>The PSI method can also be considered an adaptive fixed-grid-level procedure.</s>
          <s>While the variability of the slope estimates improves for small slopes, the differences are small across the parameter space, as shown by the small value of the inhomogeneity metric σ.</s>
          <s>Similar to the threshold estimates, MOCS shows threshold-dependent ripples in the performance of the slope estimation, also resulting in large inhomogeneity, due to suboptimal and coarse distribution of stimuli.</s>

          <s>As in the present work, it was suggested to use a clear suprathreshold initial stimulus intensity (i.e., level at high proportion of correct responses) and a large initial step size, which should lead to a good performance independent of the slope of the psychometric function <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>

        <head n="4.4.3">Limitations.</head>
        <p>
          <s>One limitation of this analysis framework is the need to representatively sample the parameter space and acquire enough information to observe the behavior of different sampling procedures (e.g., threshold-dependent ripples induced by MOCS) as well as to run enough repetitions of the simulations to obtain representative results.</s>
          <s>As simulations have been run only 1000 times for each template and sampling procedure, the computed metrics need to be regarded as stochastic variables, and their non-deterministic nature may compromise the interpretation of the results.</s>
          <s>However, using a jackknife resampling technique (computing a distribution of metric values by systematically leaving out each simulation run once) it could be shown that the maximum standard deviation of threshold nAUC across all templates remained below 0.001 for all six sampling procedures.</s>
          <s>This is around two orders of magnitude smaller than the inhomogeneity parameter σ, proving that 1000 simulation runs are sufficient.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since the shape of the psychometric function may not follow the mathematical model ψ(x) used when fitting the psychometric function, this might introduce systematic errors.</s>
          <s>However, this is a general concern of hybrid procedures (using heuristic adaptive sampling procedures combined with fitting of parametric psychometric functions) and methods assuming a particular shape for the stimulus selection.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the presented metrics could also be used with estimates resulting directly from the adaptive sequence instead of estimates from the fitting process.</s>
          <s>Depending on the perception modality assessed and the sampling procedure, these two types of estimates may highly correlate (e.g., <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[40]</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since the performance metrics are intended to be used for an application-driven evaluation of sampling procedures, the present quantitative illustration is limited to the example of proprioceptive function, and a non-exhaustive set of different sampling procedures and method parameters was presented.</s>
          <s>There exist other commonly used sampling procedures (e.g., QUEST <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[17]</ref> ) that could be evaluated with this framework.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that this framework does not allow deducing the performance of one sampling procedure from another in absence of a theoretical analysis of the sampling procedures.</s>
          <s>Therefore, new simulations would be required for other sampling procedures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To simplify the simulations and the presentation of the results, the guess rate γ = 0.5 and lapse rate λ = 0 were held constant for the templates as well as for the fitting process instead of using free parameters.</s>
          <s>Since it has been shown that not taking lapses into account may bias the threshold estimates <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> , and that perception can be non-stationary during experiments due to, for example, inattention, learning, or change in decision criteria <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23,</ref>

            <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[60]</ref>
            <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[61]</ref>
            <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[62]</ref> , more realistic simulations should take these factors into account, and more elaborate sampling procedures <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[16]</ref> or methods to address these specific challenges could be used in combination with the fitting process or the sampling procedure <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since the perception thresholds and slopes of the sampled population may not be linearly distributed, as assumed in this work when resampling the PCTw/iB ±Tol or nAUC space, a more realistic distribution (e.g., log-normal distribution for parameters with semi-infinite positive support) could be based on some prior knowledge.</s>
          <s>This could be achieved by defining an n-dimensional (in the present case two-dimensional for the threshold and slope parameters) density function in the parameter space to correct nVUS with a weighting factor (e.g.</s>
          <s>multiplying the volume sections by a factor) or to calculate the inhomogeneity parameter σ based on a non-linear resampled space (i.e., resampling density according to the population distribution).</s>

        <head n="5">Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>This work introduces a set of novel metrics to evaluate the performance of psychophysical sampling procedures in estimating parameters of psychometric functions quantitatively, using application-driven simulations.</s>
          <s>The analysis framework can be used for any type of sampling procedure and parameters to be estimated (e.g., threshold, slope, lapse rate), and is independent of the parametric versions of psychometric functions (e.g., normal, logistic, Weibull) and the application-specific parameter spaces.</s>
          <s>In summary, the illustrative analysis of a simulation based on a scenario of proprioceptive assessment using these metrics allowed identifying suboptimal parameter choices for different simulated sampling procedures and deriving suggestions on how to improve the methods.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the optimal sampling procedure could be identified, which could be tuned and analyzed in a second iterative step using the same metrics framework.</s>
          <s>Thus, these metrics allow a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of the sampling procedures, facilitate the parameter tuning, and showed that it is important to evaluate the procedures for different psychometric functions with metrics beyond efficiency.</s>
