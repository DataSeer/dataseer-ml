        <p>
          <s>Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the airways and other structures of the lungs commonly include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, respiratory allergies, and occupational lung diseases <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Globally in 2016 CRDs, in particular, COPD and Asthma affected 251 <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> and 339 <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> million people respectively.</s>
          <s>In the same year 2016, COPD caused about 3.2 million deaths worldwide, in which low and middle-income countries (LMIC) accounted for more than 90% of those deaths <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The deaths related to CRDs in these LMIC are commonly due to lack of proper management <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) including Tanzania, CRDs, in particular, COPD and Asthma have been a silent killer of many people <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The established commonest cause of CRDs is tobacco smoking, and indoor air pollution <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, in SSA the burden and risks of CRDs are high greatly fueled by indoor air pollution from the high-level use of biomass fuel, HIV/AIDS pandemic, Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumonia <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For instance, the proportion of households using biomass fuel in this region ranges from 86-99% and 26-96% in rural and urban areas respectively <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Tanzanian, more than 90% of energy sources for cooking, heating, and lighting comes from solid biomass fuels such as firewood and charcoal <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Tobacco smoking prevalence is 14% for men and 0.6% in females <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , however, the COPD burden is also high among the female population due to indoor air pollution during cooking.</s>
          <s>The previous study conducted in rural Tanzania found that the prevalence of COPD was 17.5% (21.7% in males and 12.9%), and the associated causal risks were exposure to biomass fuel, pulmonary tuberculosis, and tobacco smoking <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the prevalence of self-reported Asthma among secondary school student in urban and rural Tanzania was found to be 17.6% and 6.4% respectively <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, CRDs in particular COPD is potentially associated with extra-pulmonary manifestation including cardiovascular disease (CVD) hence patients are more likely to die from acute cardiovascular events than the primary lung pathology <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD also have been reported in Tanzania among patients with COPD in which 15.4% and 24% of study participants had CVDs and albuminuria (a marker of vascular endothelial dysfunction) respectively <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Generally, management of patients with CRDs is based on diagnosis confirmation and proper management of the symptoms to prevent acute exacerbation <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite the spirometry is the Gold standard for diagnosis of CRDs, a peak flow meter can be used to diagnose bronchial asthma in repeated measurement.</s>
          <s>However, it should not be used as a substitute for the spirometry <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In management or control of the symptomatic CRDs may include the use of inhaled bronchodilators (e.g.</s>
          <s>salbutamol), and corticosteroids like beclomethasone and budesonide <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These basic medicines are of very important for life serving and as controller of disease symptoms.</s>
          <s>However, previous studies showed that there is a scarcity of diagnostic equipment and basic medicines for CRDs at many health facilities in SSA including Tanzania <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Traditionally, the Tanzanian health system is designed to provide Reproductive Health services and manage communicable diseases which are more prevalent than non-communicable diseases (NCD).</s>
          <s>Despite the increase in NCD cases that create a double burden situation within the country, the budget and resources allocation is still insufficient for management of NCD such as CRDs <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent studies in Tanzania have shown that the primary health care facilities are not adequately equipped to respond to the increasing burden of hypertension and diabetes mellitus <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, it is not known whether or not the healthcare facilities are adequately equipped and ready to provide management for CRDs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Therefore, this study sought to explore the availability of services and factors associated with the readiness of health facilities to manage CRDs in Tanzania.</s>
          <s>This will help to inform the policymakers the area which requires necessary improvement given the high burden of CRDs and associated risk factors.</s>

          <s>The first domain was staff and guidelines which had two indicators; the presence of a guideline for the management of CRDs and at least one staff who received a refresher training to manage CRDs.</s>
          <s>The facilities with guidelines were categorized as "Yes" while those without such guidelines were categorized as "No." similarly, facilities with at least one staff member that had received refresher training in CRDs within 24 months were categorized as "Yes," otherwise were categorized as "No".</s>
          <s>The second domain was equipment which had four indicators; the peak flow meter, spacer devices, stethoscopes, and oxygen cylinders.</s>
          <s>Each equipment indicator was categorized as "Yes" for facilities that had reported the presence of such an indicator and "No" for facilities reported the absence of such an indicator.</s>
          <s>The third domain was a basic medicine which had five indicators: the availability injectable epinephrine, hydrocortisone and prednisolone tablets, salbutamol, and beclomethasone inhalers.</s>

          <s>In this article, we examined the availability of services and level of health facilities readiness to provide management for CRDs and its associated factors in Tanzania.</s>
          <s>Our study revealed the unsatisfactory proportion of Tanzanian health facilities with a high level of readiness to provide management for CRDs.</s>
          <s>In addition, it found that privately owned facilities, high-level facilities (hospitals and health centers), and performance of routine management meetings were significantly associated with a high readiness to provide management for CRDs.</s>
          <s>The WHO strategy for prevention and control of CRDs recommends provision of refresher training to healthcare providers and ensure availability, accessibility, and affordability of guideline, diagnostics equipment, and basic medicines for the management of CRDs <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the current study found the low proportion of health facilities with the availability of guidelines, trained staff, equipment, and basic medicines necessary for management of CRDs.</s>
          <s>These findings are in agreement with those reported in previous studies conducted in other SSA countries <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the current study found that the overall proportion of health facilities readiness to provide management for CRDs was very low.</s>
          <s>Given the existing epidemiological risks and burden of CRDs in Tanzania context, there is an urgent need to address the availability of important components in all health facilities across the country regardless of facility type and managing authority.</s>
          <s>Otherwise, this may lead to under-recognition, under-diagnosis, and under-treatment of CRDs hence fueling the epidemic of NCD in Tanzania.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The current study found that private owned facilities and high-level facilities (health centers and hospitals) were more likely to have a high readiness to provide management for CRDs compared to publicly owned facilities and lower-level facilities (dispensaries) respectively.</s>
          <s>The observed finding might be explained by the evidence that private owned health facilities in the LMIC setting have sustainable healthcare provision in terms of responsibility, accountability, and efficiency than publicly owned health facilities <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, might be due to the fact that publicly owned facilities have a long process (involving multiple levels of authorization) in ordering and procuring of equipment and basic medicines for facility consumption <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This long process may result in the low availability of equipment and medicine, therefore, may explain the high proportion of publicly owned facilities to have low readiness for management of CRDs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Moreover, the current study found that facilities that conducted routine management meetings were significantly more likely to have a high readiness to provide management for CRDs compared to their counterpart.</s>
          <s>The performance of routine management meetings may have a great influence in clinical decision making especially when it is reflected in complex cases scenario of CRDs.</s>
          <s>This may motivate the health facility authority to make available of necessary components for managing CRDs.</s>
          <s>The current study finding is comparable to the previous study in Tanzania which found that performance of routine management meetings was significantly associated with health facility being prepared to provide management for hypertension <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the current findings suggest that routine management meetings may an independent factor that can influence the readiness of health facilities to provide management for CRDs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition, facility residence (rural or urban) was found to be the not significant associated with the high readiness of the health facility to provide management for CRDs.</s>
          <s>In Tanzania, more than 70% of the population lives in a rural setting which is served mostly by public health facilities <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, the risk of CRDs from indoor air pollution due to the use of solid biomass fuel in a rural setting is high <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence this study highlights the urgent need to improve important infrastructure necessary for health facilities readiness to provide management for CRDs.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the government should strive to improve the availability of components for management of CRDs in particular to the public health facilities which serve the majority of the population.</s>

            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , a respiratory infectious disease in particular pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumonia.</s>
          <s>Post pulmonary tuberculosis treatment sequelae include bronchiectasis and fibro-thorax which are the components of CRDs <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26,</ref>

            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the epidemiology of CRDs in Tanzania is of its own uniqueness in the shadow of infectious diseases and solid biomass fuel use.</s>
          <s>Given this circumstance, it is of paramount importance to have service available for management of CRDs in all health facilities in the Tanzania context.</s>

          <s>The study used a nationally representative sample in which our findings reflect the actual situation of the health facilities regarding management of CRDs.</s>
          <s>However, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits its utility to explain the relative proportion and temporal relation of all the causative factors to the burden of CRDs.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.</s>
          <s>In addition, the current study did not assess the availability of other important components for management of CRDs such as diagnostic spirometry and nebulizer machines; this might have changed the obtained results.</s>

          <s>Majority of Tanzanian health facilities have low readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases.</s>
          <s>Privately owned facilities, higher-level facilities (hospitals and health centers), and performance of routine management meetings were significantly associated with high readiness to provide management for CRDs.</s>
          <s>There is a need for the Tanzanian government to increase the availability of diagnostic equipment, medication, and to provide refresher training specifically in the lower-level and public health facilities for better management of CRDs and other non-communicable diseases.</s>
