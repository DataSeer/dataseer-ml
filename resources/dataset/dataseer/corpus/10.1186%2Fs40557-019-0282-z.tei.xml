            <s>Background: The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) during working hours by job status and occupation.</s>
            <s>Methods: Using the 4th Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS), 49,674 respondents who answered the question about SHS were studied.</s>
            <s>A chi-square test was carried out to determine whether there is a significant different in SHS exposure frequency by general and occupational characteristics and experience of discrimination at work and logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify the risk level of SHS exposure by variables.</s>
            <s>Results: In this study, we found that male workers in their 40s and 50s, workers employed in workplaces with fewer than 50 employees, daily workers, and people working outdoors had a higher rate of exposure to SHS than the others.</s>
            <s>The top five occupations with the highest SHS exposure were construction and mining-related occupations, metal core-makers-related trade occupations, wood and furniture, musical instrument, and signboardrelated trade occupations, transport and machine-related trade occupations, transport and leisure services occupations.</s>
            <s>The least five exposed occupations were public and enterprise senior officers, legal and administrative professions, education professionals, and health, social welfare, and religion-related occupations.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: Tobacco smoke is a significant occupational hazard.</s>
            <s>Smoking ban policy in the workplace can be a very effective way to reduce the SHS exposure rate in the workplace and can be more effective if specifically designed by the job status and various occupations.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Second hand smoke (SHS), which is exposure to smoke from cigarette butts or smoke exhaled by smokers, is itself a Group 1 carcinogen for the human as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).</s>
          <s>Exposure to SHS is known to be associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as anxiety disorders, mental health, and psychological stress <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>According to the National Health Statistics in Korea for 2015 <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , the current indoor SHS exposure rate of nonsmokers at work was 26.8%, remarkably high compared with at home, which is 8.2%.</s>
          <s>From OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) data <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> , the smoking rate for Korean males aged more than 15 was 31.4% as of 2015, which was the third highest rank among OECD countries.</s>
          <s>The Korean government has implemented a policy of smoking bans in public places for many years, but that smoking policy only applies with a workplace more than 1000 m 2 in total area <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For that reason, the workplace is still at a high rate of SHS exposure and could be the environment that can be improved further in SHS exposure reduction.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>From 1999 to 2002 US NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data, there have been dramatic reduction in the serum cotinine levels caused by successful smoking-free laws <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although SHS exposure rates are declining, the workplace remains a significant source of SHS exposure <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Working adults spend most of their time at workplace and for those non-smokers, the workplace may be the major source of provider to SHS exposure <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the German study, More than 40% of non-smokers reported experiencing SHS at work <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Workplace smoking is an occupational health hazard and a smoking ban policy at the workplace is the best option to reduce SHS <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>More than 50% of European countries enforce non-smoking regulations at work and the other European countries also partially restrict smoking at work.</s>
          <s>In the Netherlands, the comparison of SHS exposure rates before and after the implementation of the smoking ban policy in the workplace showed that the SHS exposure rate decreased from 70.7 to 51.9%.</s>
          <s>However, the rate of SHS exposure is still high in the Netherlands even after the smoking ban at work, because of a high-risk group for smoking such as males and low-educated workers <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Smoking cessation ban in the workplace can be a very effective way to reduce the SHS rate in the workplace and can be more effective if specifically designed for the various occupations and working styles in each country.</s>
          <s>Particularly in South Korea, workers in their 40s and 50s, workers employed in workplaces with less than 50 employees, daily workers and temporary workers, workers who work outside, and construction workers are priority target for non-smoking regulations at work.</s>
