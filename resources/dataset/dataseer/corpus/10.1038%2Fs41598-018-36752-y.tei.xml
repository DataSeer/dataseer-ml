          <s>Ultrasonication has been proved to be a simple but an effective way to exfoliate graphite, bulk MoS 2 , and some other layered materials, because ultrasonic waves generate cavitation bubbles capable of breaking up the MoS 2 crystalline and producing MoS 2 nanosheets <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>As known, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is an excellent solvent for exfoliating 2D layered <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> .</s>
          <s>So we explored NMP as the solvent to prepare MoS 2 nanosheets by utilization of ultrasonication in the experiment.</s>
          <s>The structure and morphology of the as-exfoliated MoS 2 nanosheets were characterized by TEM.</s>
          <s>The TEM images in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref> clearly show that the well-exfoliated nanosheets were very thin, and a histogram of measured nanosheets size in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> indicates that the average lateral sizes of MoS 2 were 200-250 nm.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Then, XRD was employed to characterize the MoS 2 nanosheets.</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> , the XRD spectra of bulk MoS 2 crystals matched with the previously reported literature <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>The typical diffraction peaks centered at 14.3° is attributed to the (002), which belongs to the bulk MoS 2 .</s>
          <s>After exfoliated, the characteristic peak disappeared, indicating the existence of lamellar form in the exfoliated MoS 2 .</s>
          <s>The results demonstrate the successful fabrication of MoS 2 nanosheets.</s>

        <p>
          <s>As known, the MoS 2 nanosheets contain stable hexagonal semiconducting phase (2H phase) and metastable metallic phase(1T).</s>
          <s>XPS was employed <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 2c,d</ref> ) to survey the spectrum of Mo and S and the surface chemical properties of the as-prepared MoS 2 nanosheets.</s>

            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results show that the dominant 2H phase in the MoS 2 nanosheets have been obtained from sonication-assisted exfoliation of MoS 2 powder.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the optical properties of MoS 2 dispersion were investigated by UV-visible spectra.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. S2a</ref> shows the UV-visible spectrum of the diluted MoS 2 dispersion in ethanol.</s>

        <figDesc>, the I SD of FET sensor showed a gradual decrease as the concentration of H 2 O 2 increased. The sensing mechanism may be attributed to generation of the positive charges upon addition of H 2 O 2 , leading to a conductance decrease of the MoS 2 / RGO FET sensor. As reported, MoS 2 can play as peroxidase mimics 22,45 for decomposing H 2 O 2 . For horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the reaction mechanism with H 2 O 2 is to form the reactive enzyme intermediate compound and produce hydroxyl radicals and H +46 . So the possible mechanism of MoS 2 catalyzing H 2 O 2 is similar to that of HRP. In such a case, a positive charge (H + ) is generated when H 2 O 2 is applied to the MoS 2 /RGO sensor. This is in good agreement with the literature, in which H 2 O 2 can react with polypyrrole (PPy) to generate a positive charge on RGO/PPy nanotube FET-type sensor</figDesc>

        <table>detect H 2 O 2 from living cell because of its diverse biological functions. For this experiment, we first investigated 
the influence of weak acid environment on sensor's performance from pH 6.4 to 7.4 (These different pH values 
were made by adding HCl or NaOH to PBS solutions, which were finally adjusted by a commercial pH meter). 
The results show that the weak acid environment did not have significant influence on the change of Dirac point 
after different pH values were applied (Figure S6). Then, real-time detection of extracellular H 2 O 2 released from 
HeLa cells was performed by the MoS 2 /RGO FET sensor. As known, the HeLa cells can generate H 2 O 2 when 
stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, PMA is a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), which 
can activate PKC to produce H 2 O 2 ). On the contrary, H 2 O 2 can be decomposed by catalase. Before cell level 
measurement, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h on the MoS 2 </table>
