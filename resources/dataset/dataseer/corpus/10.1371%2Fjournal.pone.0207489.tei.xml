          <s>Using microorganisms like bacteria to seal cracks and plug fractures is a relatively new idea.</s>
          <s>Some bacteria like Sporosarcina pasteurii have the unique capability to secrete large volumes of urease, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into simpler organic molecules <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Through a series of linked chemical reactions, these bacteria can ultimately lead to the formation of calcium carbonates in aqueous media.</s>
          <s>This phenomenon is often called Microbiologically Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) and has the potential of causing both short and long-range clogging in porous media.</s>
          <s>MICP has attracted attention in recent years in applications as varied as underground carbon storage and sequestration <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> [3], heritage structure conservation <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>

            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> and many others.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The existing body of literature in this area focusses primarily on macro-scale systems and the enhancement in their mechanical properties resulting from MICP.</s>
          <s>These studies do not report on the microscale bacteria-level analysis of the complex interplay between fluid mechanics, solid mechanics and chemical thermodynamics of the precipitation process.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, a majority of the previous literature on bacterial transport inside porous media deal with packed column experiments, which do not attempt to capture the heterogeneous nature of the bio-hydrodynamics (w.r.t.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is now well established that enhancement in strength is possible in porous structural material via microbiological means.</s>
          <s>Examples of microbes (bacteria) which have recently been popular within the structural engineering community include S. pasteurii, B. megaterium and Shewenella sp.</s>
          <s>Especially for MICP caused by S. pasteurii, the effects of factors like fibre-addition <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> , oxygen availability <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , concentrations of cells, enzymes and cementation media <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> have been well-documented.</s>
          <s>Many different studies have provided evidence of MICP-mediated strength enhancement within a wide range of engineering materials.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In a set of experiments with specimens of cement mortar paste containing various ratios of fly ash and B. megaterium cells, the specimens were subjected to a post-treatment with a mixture of nutrient broth urea (NBU) enriched with CaCl 2 <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Compared to control samples, these exhibited superior compressive strength.</s>
          <s>Although there was no significant improvement after a week, the strength increased by more than 20% in four weeks.</s>
          <s>Another study involving Shewenella sp.</s>
          <s>extracted from river waters and mixed with mortar paste showed definitive increase in strength at concentrations higher than <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> 5 CFU/mL.</s>
          <s>This measurement was further complemented with imaging studies showing the existence of fibrous structures inside the porous network that reduce the effective porosity <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A clever study encapsulated S. pasteurii cells inside Siran TM glass beads <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Concrete bars with artificially indented cracks of uniform dimensions on them were used as specimens.</s>
          <s>The control samples had their cracks filled with empty beads, nutrient solution and CaCl 2 .</s>
          <s>The other set had, in addition to the above, live cells of S. pasteurii injected onto the cracks.</s>
          <s>This set showed better strength for all concentrations (107-10 9 cells/cm 3 ) after a week and a month.</s>
          <s>It may be noted that the glass beads immobilized with bacteria provided additional surface area for the formation of a calcite layer that served as a protective coating on the cement, this increasing durability.</s>

          <s>In the present work, commercial sponge blocks have been used as porous media mimics.</s>
          <s>A holistic understanding of the process from its physical, chemical and biological perspectives has been attempted by performing comprehensive examinations of several mechanistic aspects such as compressive strength, pore-scale geometry (via μ-CT scanning technology) as well as electron microscopy visualizations at the length scale of the pore-network.</s>
          <s>A critical challenge surrounding all MICP-based technologies is the prevention of enhanced cementation in the immediate neighborhood of the inlet, an artifact of the inherent non-uniform distribution of bacteria inside a micro-scale network.</s>
          <s>In this respect too, our study complements the preexisting breakthrough-curve based analyses in the literature.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although it's possible to construct relatively simple network geometries via machining, glass etching or lithography; fabrication of complex 3-D pore systems that resemble a natural fracture is extremely difficult <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is the primary reason why off-the-shelf commercial sponge blocks have been used as experimental specimens.</s>
          <s>The typical sponge block has a range of characteristic length scales in the form of variable pore-size and geometry that is similar to a real inhomogeneous porous medium like a geologic structure, rock, sandstone etc.</s>
          <s>The objective of the present work is to characterize the sponge samples used as test samples and to examine the extent of enhancement in mechanical properties post-treatment by pore blockage from the bacteria-induced chemical precipitation.</s>
          <s>The samples have been analyzed before and after treatment with respect to multiple factors.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There have been a few previous studies on S. pasteurii or other bacteria and their roles in enzyme-mediated ureolysis/calcite precipitation inside porous media.</s>
          <s>Most of these studies have focused on large-scale systems and modifications in bulk properties.</s>
          <s>These studies have not concentrated on the smaller length scales of the order of microns and none have applied a combination of tools like x-ray imaging and scanning technology to quantify systemic parameters.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For example, the possibility of using S. pasteurii to mitigate potential CO 2 -leakage from underground storage reservoirs has been explored before <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is argued that low-viscosity fluids like biofilms are advantageous in this context given they reduce the required injection pressures and increase the radius of influence around the point of injection.</s>
          <s>It has been possible to design a strategy to uniformly distribute biofilm-induced calcite precipitation inside a sand-filled column and also to seal a Boyles sandstone core which had been hydraulically fractured.</s>
          <s>A 2-4 orders of magnitude reduction in permeability and a tripling of tolerance for bore pressure were reported as results.</s>
          <s>Tracer imaging and time-lapse photography have also been used to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of calcite crystals <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study investigated the efficiency of S. pasteurii-induced MICP inside small and large-scale artificial fractures consisting of a rough rock lower surface and a smooth plastic upper surface.</s>
          <s>A modified injection strategy was designed to accelerate the process as compared to the continuous flow arrangement.</s>
          <s>It was also possible to control the extent of precipitation by regulating the injection fluid velocity.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One main novelty of the present work is the application of high-resolution x-ray imaging and computerized tomography tools to visualize the pore network and understand the threedimensional nature of the pore geometry.</s>
          <s>There exist some examples of similar studies in nonbiological contexts.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Nonetheless, the geometric aspects of an entire pore network has been previously compared with individual fractures in the network <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a natural coal sample, a combination of Wood's metal injection technique with X-ray Computerized Tomography (CT) was used to analyze the aperture distribution.</s>
          <s>The distribution was found to be anisotropic and a function of individual pore geometry.</s>
          <s>A 3-D autocorrelation analysis and a 2-D planar analysis were performed respectively at the network and individual fracture levels.</s>
          <s>An integrated system to measure and analyze a fracture network was subsequently developed <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It could correlate network geometry with physical properties of the system by using a hybrid approach involving X-ray tomography and 3-D image processing to visualize the fracture geometry in a coal core sample.</s>
          <s>The variation in porosity as a function of displacement along the core axes could be quantified as well.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Elsewhere, a high-density high-contrast metal injection technique has been combined with gravimetric analysis and tomographic imaging under lithostatic conditions to reconstruct the fracture topology with one micron resolution <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The spatial quantifications on the distribution of pore sizes and connectivity inside an opaque bituminous coal sample were also obtained.</s>
          <s>In yet another study <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , the distribution of network porosity in core rock samples containing natural fractures was analyzed.</s>
          <s>Medical imaging algorithms were combined with Wood's metal injection technique to compute the mean network aperture over the length scale of the core and to analyze the associated 3-D geometry.</s>
          <s>Graph theory was applied to the reconstructed network to determine transport parameters like the capillary pressure-saturation relationships.</s>
          <s>X-ray imaging has also been used on bio-cemented Ottawa 50-70 sand samples before and after triaxial compression tests to observe an abrupt change in the mechanism of deformation from homogeneous to dilatant shearing at peak stress <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A different paradigm in scanning technology, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been used to study bacterial systems.</s>
          <s>One approach used a combination of MRI and immuno-magnetic labeling to non-invasively visualize the changes in spatial distribution of a bacteria population inside a saturated porous medium <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>They attached magnetite particles on the cell surface of E. coli to track the movements of individual cells and compared the observations with existing transport models for motile and non-motile biological cells.</s>
          <s>Very recently, MRI and μ-CT were combined as complementary techniques to quantify the advective and dispersive aspects of chemical precipitation inside a porous medium <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although the study did not use bacteria, this technique can well be extended to any reactive transport system such as MICP.</s>
          <s>MRI in conjugation with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging has also been used to study the process of MICP inside a model glass bead pack and a real sandstone core <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Precipitation was seen to occur mostly near the inlet for the model bead system whereas it was more uniform for the natural system.</s>
          <s>Another study discusses the problem of fluid transport inside a polyurethane foam and the effects of compression on the velocity field using MRI <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There also exists a large body of literature on the physical, chemical and biological aspects of MICP.</s>
          <s>The present work not only complements but builds up on many previous findings.</s>
          <s>A few must be mentioned here.</s>
          <s>P. fluorescens and P. cepacia cells labeled with radionuclides have been used to understand the effect of fluid velocity on motile and non-motile bacterial transport inside saturated porous media <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This work extended the colloid filtration theory to examine the effects of fluid flow on cell retention rates and observed some deviations from theoretical predictions.</s>
          <s>An effort to introduce additional parameters to account for the discrepancy and identify an optimum was also made.</s>
          <s>In a different study, the researchers used saline and phosphate buffer solutions to grow S. pasteurii and P. aeuruginosa.</s>
          <s>Both live and dead cells were used for comparison.</s>
          <s>It was found that saline buffers are detrimental to increase of strength.</s>
          <s>This observation was explained using ionic equilibrium arguments resulting form addition of Cl -ions <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The general physical and chemical variables influencing microbial transport inside porous media have also been studied <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Effects of several variables like ionic strength, cell size, grain size and heterogeneity of the media on cellular transport were quantified by adding restingcell suspensions of bacteria on top of packed clean quartz sand columns and pumping artificial groundwater all the way through.</s>
          <s>The change in permeability of a porous medium resulting from in situ enzymatic production of calcium carbonate has been investigated as well <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>No bacteria were used for their experiments.</s>
          <s>Effects of enzyme concentration, temperature and amount of reactants (urea and calcium chloride) too were studied on a batch system of Berea sandstone cores and unconsolidated porous media.</s>
          <s>It was examined how multiple injections affect the efficiency of plugging.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The possibility of extending random walk calculations originally developed for abiotic disordered continuum systems to the problem of bacterial motility in porous media has also been explored <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Model porous media were generated using molecular dynamic simulations and the Einstein relation was applied to compute the effective bacterial diffusion coefficient.</s>
          <s>Yet another new idea that has been explored is that of autogeneous healing via MICP.</s>
          <s>In contrast to the usual approach where the bacterial agent is supplied externally, this technique involves integrating active cells in the construction material (cement, mortar, concrete) under application.</s>
          <s>It is proposed that self-integrated microbial populations are more efficient than external populations in achieving MICP-based bioremediation (sealing cracks and plugging holes) under a wider range of conditions.</s>
          <s>The study involving B. cohnii cells integrated onto coarse concrete is worth referencing <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[32]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Last but not the least, there have also been instances of results that question the effectiveness of MICP-based strengthening techniques.</s>
          <s>A comparative study <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[33]</ref> of the 3-point compressive and bending strengths of concrete slabs containing four different bacterial strains (S. pasteurii, B. pseudofirmus, B. halodurnas and B. cohnii) with control samples failed to measure any improvements.</s>
          <s>At least one piece of literature casts a doubt on the capability of S. pasteurii to enhance mechanical strength via MICP.</s>
          <s>This study investigated the effects of five calciteforming bacteria (CFB) species including S. pasteurii on mortar strength <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For the experiments, a fresh inoculum was cultured to be mixed with the mortar, which was subsequently cured in a solution of urea and CaCl 2 .</s>
          <s>The other four species under investigation were: S. soli, B. massiliensis, A. crystallopoietes and L. fusiformis.</s>
          <s>Only two out of the five species (B.</s>

          <s>The average density of each block is reported to be 48 kg/m 3 and the average spatial void fraction is about 90%.</s>
          <s>The type of sample chosen was of flexible, open-foam variety.</s>
          <s>These samples are highly anisotropic with significant variations in mechanical strength along the three axes.</s>
          <s>All results reported in this work are based on loading tests performed along the 25 mm axis that is the orientation of the foaming.</s>
          <s>The mechanical behavior for loading along the other two axes has been shown in the supplementary material (Figures J and K in S1 File).</s>
          <s>The specimens have a tendency to deform in response to applied compressive loads and completely recover back to the initial state once the load is withdrawn.</s>
          <s>This helps in resisting multiple loading cycles within an yield limit of compressive stress, beyond which the open foam cell walls collapse and completely change the mechanical properties.</s>
          <s>ASTM standards for open foam cellular material was followed as precisely as possible.</s>

          <s>The present work has utilized sponge blocks as surrogate porous medium mimics to study the phenomenon of MICP.</s>
          <s>This approach has several advantages in terms of the ease of experimentation and the analysis of the various physical, chemical and biological aspects associated with the process.</s>
          <s>Through techniques such as μ-CT scanning and SEM, we have tried to understand the nature and extent of precipitation inside the real pore network and also correlated precipitation with enhancement in mechanical strength.</s>
          <s>This is the first study that quantifies the phenomenon of MICP inside micro-scale pores with a synergy of compressive strength, computerized micro-tomography and porosity data.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The first key observation is the inherent non-linearity in the mechanical response of the sponge samples.</s>
          <s>Being open-celled foams, they exhibit several deformational degrees of freedom per each loading axis.</s>
          <s>This is manifested in the distribution of compression moduli under low and high shear stresses.</s>
          <s>Although there is a spread, a significant enhancement is mechanical strength is observed in a statistical sense.</s>
          <s>For an extended porous medium, where arbitrarily chosen small volumes may be analogous to individual sponge blocks, a statistical increase in compressive strength would add up incrementally, giving rise to an overall increase in strength.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another important aspect of the results is the quantification of pore connectedness through the 3D reconstruction of the network topology and the associated comparison in porosity.</s>
          <s>For a large-scale application that's targeted towards end-uses like underground carbon storage for long time-scales, this is of especial interest to the success of the technology.</s>
          <s>Limiting the available transport footprint of the fluids stored under high pressure by offering a lower porosity network path not only increases the stability of the storage system, but also ensures greater reliability and safety of operation.</s>
          <s>The micro-tomography results obtained in the present work may be extended to field-scale industrial applications to gain deeper insights into clogging process at the dimensions of microns or even smaller.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, another important aspect of the present research must be mentioned.</s>
          <s>The primary motivation behind the problem was the possibility of extending the idea of bacteria-mediated pore clogging to real-life large-scale engineering systems like underground carbon sequestration reservoirs or concrete structures.</s>
          <s>Although the present findings look quite promising, caution must be exercised while directly extrapolating the results for macroscopic length scales.</s>
          <s>All of the experimental results reported here have been based on microfluidic and microscale platforms.</s>
          <s>The culture conditions have been ideal laboratory-based competition and only a single species (S. pasteurii) of bacterium has been present all throughout.</s>
          <s>Additionally, the representative porous media chosen have only a limited capacity to mimic the physical and chemical properties of a wide range of engineering materials.</s>
          <s>In contrast, any technique that successfully extends this idea to a reliable and repeatable sealing method for cracks and fractures, must take into account the biological competition from other species present in any natural non-lab ecosystem.</s>
          <s>It should also have the versatility to be implemented across a large variety of materials like rocks, sands, clays etc.</s>
          <s>This can only be achieved through more indepth experimental analyses and carefully designed parametric studies.</s>
          <s>Much more needs to be done before a comprehensive understanding of MICP emerges.</s>
          <s>Effects of several critical real-life factors like surface chemistry, material properties of the porous medium itself and other biological factors still remain less clearly understood.</s>
