        <p>
          <s>Acquired isolated third nerve palsy has been investigated for many years, with numerous studies focusing on the diagnosis, causes, and prognosis of different etiologies.</s>
          <s>It has been widely accepted that pupil size and reactivity are recognized as major clinical factors for distinguishing the different etiologies of third nerve palsy, notably compressive lesions from microvascular nerve infarction.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> The peripheral location of pupillomotor fibers along the subarachnoid space is considered as a neuroanatomical explanation for pupil-sparing or pupil-involving third nerve pareses.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> Pupil-sparing third nerve pareses are known to be caused by microvascular ischemia, whereas pupil-involving pareses occur as a result of compressive or infiltrative lesions.</s>
          <s>Accordingly, pupillary involvement has been considered to be the hallmark for dangerous causes of third nerve palsy.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> However, pupillary involvement has also been observed in a few cases of microvascular third nerve palsy.</s>

            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> A recent study by Keane pointed out that in patients with diabetes, 53% showed pupillary involvement.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> On the contrary, pupil-sparing third nerve palsies have also been reported in compressive lesions.</s>

            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> However, none of the previous studies have objectively documented the extent of pupillary involvement according to various etiologies of third nerve palsy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite the strong emphasis placed on pupillary examination in third nerve palsy, in fact, pupillary involvement is subjectively examined by the physician with limited interobserver reliability.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> Therefore, automated pupillometry may be considered as a potential method to increase the reliability of measuring pupil reactivity.</s>
          <s>Nowadays, digital pupillometry can be used to obtain objective features and subtle abnormalities of the pupillary light response and help get an accurate diagnosis in various neuro-ophthalmological diseases.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no published reports quantitatively analyzing pupillary involvement in third nerve palsy.</s>
          <s>Herein, we objectively measured pupillary responses in acquired isolated third nerve palsy according to various etiologies using a dynamic pupillometry device, and evaluated the efficacy of digital pupillometry in discriminating compressive lesions from microvascular ischemic third nerve palsy.</s>
