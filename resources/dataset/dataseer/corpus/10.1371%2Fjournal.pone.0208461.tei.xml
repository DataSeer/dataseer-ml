        <p>
          <s>Gastric acid suppressants (GASs), including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), are therapeutic agents used for gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD).</s>
          <s>In the inpatient setting, these agents may also be used in critically ill patients for stress ulcer prophylaxis.</s>
          <s>H2RAs and PPIs were first introduced to the market in the 1980's, and since then, these medications have become some of the most commonly used drug classes in the United states <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PPIs became especially prevalent between 1995 and 2006, with PPI treatment (43.9 prescriptions per 1000 visits) greatly outpacing the increase in GERD diagnoses (at 16.3 per 1000 visits) during that time period, likely due to their availability over-the-counter <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Between 2002 and 2009, the number of outpatient visits with documented PPI use more than doubled, from 30 million to 84 million; however, no documented gastrointestinal complaints or diagnoses were found in over 60% of these visits <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>H2RA use is common as well.</s>
          <s>A 2015 study found that roughly 30 out of every 1,000 adult patients among 5 million Medicaid members had a prescription for a H2RA <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>More recently, a significant body of evidence links long-term use of PPIs with serious adverse effects.</s>
          <s>Studies have shown that PPI use can lead to increased risk of bone fracture <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , vitamin and mineral deficiencies <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , and Clostridium difficile infection <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PPIs have also been associated with pneumonia <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , dementia <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> , gastric cancer <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , and chronic kidney disease <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>H2RAs are not as strongly linked to adverse effects like Clostridium difficile infection and dementia <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , but safety information on this drug class is also lacking <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite the emergence of important safety information regarding GASs, it is unknown if outpatient GAS prescribing rates have decreased in recent years.</s>
          <s>The aim of this study was to examine trends in GAS prescribing rates, as well as appropriateness of prescribing using nationally-representative outpatient data.</s>

          <s>The data represent 6.8 billion patient visits to ambulatory care clinics between 2009 and 2015 (average of 965 million visits per year), of which nearly 600 million (8.8%) had documented GAS use.</s>

          <s>GAS users and non-users differed with respect to demographics, comorbidities, practitioner and practitioner specialty (p&lt;0.0001</s>
          <s>for all).</s>
          <s>GAS users were older than non-users (median age 62 vs. 49 years, respectively).</s>
          <s>Similarly, Medicare was more often the primary payment source for GAS users (43.6%) compared to non-users (25.3%).</s>
          <s>GAS users were found to have a higher number of chronic comorbidities when compared to non-users, with the greatest percentage differences in hyperlipidemia, arthritis, and diabetes.</s>
          <s>The majority of practitioners who prescribed GASs were physicians (98.3%).</s>
          <s>The primary practice specialty reported by GAS prescribers was primary care (56.2%).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The most commonly prescribed PPIs were omeprazole (52.1%), esomeprazole (18.9%), and pantoprazole (14.9%); while the most commonly prescribed H2RAs were ranitidine (63.0%) and famotidine (32.7%).</s>
          <s>The percentage of PPIs prescribed per outpatient visits decreased <ref type="figure">(Fig 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Meanwhile, H2RA use slowly increased from 1.4% in 2009 to 2.0% in 2015.</s>
          <s>For GAS agents overall, the percentage prescribed increased from 7.7% to 9.7% of outpatient visits from 2012 to 2015.</s>
          <s>GAS prescribing was significantly higher from 2012-2015 (9.1%) compared to 2009-2011 (8.6%) (p&lt;0.0001).</s>
          <s>These trends did not correspond to proportions of documented GAS indications, which decreased over time from 2.7% in 2009 to 2.2% in 2015.</s>

          <s>Among patients 65 years and older, only 11.4% of GAS users had an indication.</s>
          <s>The most common indication reported was GERD (84.8% of all GAS indications).</s>
          <s>A sensitivity analysis including less common indications for GAS use demonstrated that 47.2% of all GAS users and 48.3% of elderly GAS had an indication.</s>
          <s>This was primarily driven by a large proportion of GAS users who were concomitantly prescribed an NSAID (29.8%) or a steroid (5.3%).</s>
          <s>Indications for GAS use among outpatients remained relatively stable over the study period.</s>

          <s>This study described national GAS prescribing trends and the proportion of GAS prescriptions with a documented indication for use between 2009 and 2015.</s>
          <s>To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to evaluate how GAS prescribing trends have changed in recent years.</s>
          <s>This is especially important in light of new safety data released regarding PPIs.</s>
          <s>This study continues to show increasing GAS prescribing.</s>
          <s>It also supports the findings of previous studies that show that the majority of PPI prescriptions are written without an appropriate indication.</s>

        <p>
          <s>While our study found an increasing rate of PPI prescribing in recent years, the rate of increase seems to be slower than in prior years.</s>
          <s>A previous study found that PPI prescribing increased by 5.2% from 2002 to 2009, <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> whereas we documented only a 0.6% increase from 2009 to 2015.</s>
          <s>The slower increase in PPI prescribing observed may be due to more recent safety data regarding PPIs.</s>
          <s>In fact, in 2010 the FDA issued a warning that PPI use had a possible increased risk of bone fractures, followed by a safety announcement in 2012 regarding the association between PPIs and Clostridium difficile infection <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The timing of these safety warnings could potentially explain the decrease in prescribing of PPIs seen from 2009 to 2012.</s>
          <s>However, this decreasing trend was only short-term as PPI prescribing once again increased from 2012 to 2015.</s>
          <s>Lastly, during this time period, only one new GAS was FDA-approved Meanwhile, H2RA prescribing remained relatively stable between 2009 and 2015, increasing from 1.4% to 2.0%.</s>
          <s>The American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for the treatment of GERD only recommend H2RAs as conditional or adjunctive therapy, whereas PPIs are listed as the therapy of choice <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A 2015 study found that while H2RA prescribing did not increase in adults between 2005 and 2011, prescribing rates did increase in the pediatric population <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>H2RAs are commonly used to treat GERD in children.</s>
          <s>As previously mentioned, H2RAs are not as strongly linked to CDI <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> and other adverse effects as PPIs; however, further research is needed to investigate the long-term safety of H2RA use.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Only 15.8% of GAS users had a proper indication documented.</s>
          <s>The proportion of nonindicated GAS use was found to be even higher in the elderly population, with only 11.4% having an appropriate indication.</s>
          <s>Non-indicated PPI use was also observed in a 2013 study, where 65% of 1100 skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents who were prescribed a PPI lacked an appropriate diagnosis <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Notably, the median age of GAS users in our study was 62, which means a large proportion of individuals taking GASs are elderly.</s>
          <s>This is cause for concern, as GAS agents are listed within the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults.</s>
          <s>The Beers List warns against the non-indicated use of PPIs in older adults (65 years and older) due to increased risk of CDAD, bone loss and fractures.</s>
          <s>It also cites delirium as a potential adverse effect from H2Ras <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Overall, this pattern of over-or inappropriate prescribing has not only been observed in the U.S., but also globally, with increased PPI prescribing in France <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , Iceland <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , the United Kingdom <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , and New Zealand <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The widespread overutilization of non-indicated GASs could lead to increased healthcare costs.</s>
          <s>A 2018 Australian study found that PPIs constituted nearly 35% of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) prescribed to 541 aged care facility residents, leading to the highest PIM costs <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A 2010 study also showed that non-indicated PPI use accrued more than $3 million in healthcare costs over a 4 year period <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It would therefore benefit both patients and third-party payers to decrease inappropriate GAS prescribing.</s>
          <s>In the future, effective deprescribing practices require further exploration.</s>
          <s>A 2017 Cochrane review of six randomized controlled trials showed low quality evidence that switching from continuous to on-demand PPI therapy may increase the risk of losing symptom control <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Potential options include step-down therapy as opposed to abrupt discontinuation, as well as reevaluation of diagnoses in order to optimize patient therapy <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study has potential limitations, primarily related to the retrospective study design and data source.</s>
          <s>The NAMCS database only documents up to three ICD-9-CM codes per patient.</s>
          <s>It is possible that a percentage of GAS users in this study do have an appropriate, but unreported indication for GAS use.</s>
          <s>This may partially account for the low percentage of GAS users with a documented indication reported in our study.</s>
          <s>The specific reason for GAS use, nor providers' decision to initiate or continue GAS use, cannot be determined with this study design.</s>
          <s>Similarly, a percentage of non-GAS users in our study might be taking an undocumented PPI or H2RA.</s>
          <s>Patients who took these agents over-the-counter might not be accounted for.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we could not determine whether these agents were prescribed as on demand or continuous therapy.</s>
          <s>The duration of therapy is important to consider with GASs, as these medications are often indicated for use for a limited period of time.</s>
          <s>Despite these limitations, any misclassification of prescribing or indications would likely be similar across study years and not affect national trends derived from NAMCS.</s>
          <s>Finally, the large sample size results in very high study power for statistical comparisons.</s>
          <s>Statistically significant findings should be interpreted cautiously, as small absolute differences between groups might not be clinically significant.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Outpatient GAS prescribing rates increased between 2012 and 2015.</s>
          <s>Nearly 85% of all visits with documented GAS use did not report an appropriate indication.</s>
          <s>Judicious GAS prescribing needs to be exercised, especially in the context of new safety data regarding long-term PPI use.</s>
          <s>Public health initiative should aim to decrease non-indicated GAS use.</s>
