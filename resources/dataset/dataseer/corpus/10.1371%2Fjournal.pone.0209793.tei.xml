          <s>This study is the first study to examine the relationship between PM 2.5 and population mortality in Jilin Province.</s>
          <s>We found that PM 2.5 was associated with an increase in mortality from non- accidental and circulatory diseases.</s>

          <s>NO 2 and O 3 were also associated with an increase in mortality from non-accidental and circulatory diseases.</s>
          <s>The effect of O 3 is higher than other pollutants.</s>
          <s>The estimated effects in our study of PM 2.5 on non-accidental mortality risk were lower than effects observed in a worldwide meta-analysis of a 1.04% (0.52%-1.56%) per 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This discrepancy could be due to differences in population composition, geographical location and PM 2.5 sources.</s>
          <s>However, compared with studies of Chinese populations, the estimated effects in our study are higher.</s>
          <s>For example, a recent Chinese multicity study found that the risk of non-accidental death increased by 0.22% for every 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 (lag01) <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The larger effect estimates observed in our study may be due to the age of the subject.</s>
          <s>We studied the elderly and the elderly make up a high-risk group <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22,</ref>

          <s>For example, Franklin et al. studied over 1.3 million deaths in 27 US communities and found that women were more susceptible than men to the mortality effects of PM 2.5 <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>

          <s>However, the exact reasons for the gender-specific effects of air pollution on health are unclear and deserve further investigation.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Our study found that the impact on non-accidental and circulatory disease mortality from PM 2.5 is higher for those at a lower education level than for those with a higher education level, which is consistent with previous observations on individual education level <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In epidemiological studies, education has been used as a surrogate indicator of socioeconomic status (SES) <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is well known that SES can affect health indicators such as mortality <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>People of a lower SES may also receive inferior medical treatment and less health care, making them more susceptible to the effects of air pollution <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, people with a lower SES may have more limited access to fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, resulting in a reduced intake of protective fatty acids and vitamins <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our results showed that the impact of PM 2.5 on mortality from non-accidental and circulatory diseases appears to be greater among people that die outside of a hospital.</s>
          <s>People outside hospital are less likely to acquire knowledge about PM 2.5 prevention and have more exposure risks.</s>
          <s>In addition, it is more difficult for people outside hospital to receive timely treatment to alleviate a condition in the event of an outbreak.</s>

          <s>Changchun is located in northeast China and has significant seasonal differences.</s>
          <s>Although the annual average concentration of gaseous pollutants such as SO 2 , NO 2 and O 3 is not high, both SO 2 and NO 2 maintain relatively high levels during heating periods in the winter, while O 3 is relatively high in the summer, which exposes residents to persistent hazards from different air pollutants in different seasons.</s>
          <s>Our results showed that NO 2 and O 3 can increase the risk of non-accidental death in the elderly, and there was also a lag effect.</s>
          <s>Previous studies have also reached the same conclusion <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>With co-pollutant adjustment in multi-pollutant models, the effect of PM 2.5 on mortality changed slightly.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The findings support public policy-related activities focused on the reduction of PM 2.5 levels and the improvement of target daily PM 2.5 standards.</s>
          <s>The estimation of the short-term mortality risk due to short-term exposure to PM 2.5 can also help in planning appropriate medical interventions.</s>
          <s>Some limitations exist in our study: (1) Our study was based in a single city, Changchun, and generalizations need to be made in conjunction with other evidence.</s>
