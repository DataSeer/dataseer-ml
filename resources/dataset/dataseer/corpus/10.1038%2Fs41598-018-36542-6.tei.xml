            <s>In this paper, a polarization conversion metasurface (PCM) is designed for ultra wideband radar cross section (RCS) reduction.</s>
            <s>The proposed polarization conversion metasurface consists of doubleheads arrow unit cell with its 90°, 180° and 270° rotated ones to create the destructive interferences cancellation and radar cross section (RCS) reduction, consequently.</s>
            <s>The proposed metasurface demonstrates ultra-wide band 10-dB RCS reduction from 9 to 40 GHz (126.5%) for normally TM-and TE-polarized incident waves.</s>
            <s>The good agreement between the simulation and measurement results at 0°, 20° and 40° incident angles prove the idea, also.</s>
            <s>The ultra wideband RCS reduction of the proposed metasurface as well as its low profile, light weight and low cost prove its high capability compared with the state of the art references.</s>

            <s>Broadband RCS reduction has many applications in stealth military platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircrafts and missiles.</s>
            <s>Different conventional methods have been proposed to reduce RCS such as using radar absorbent materials (RAMs) and shaping.</s>
            <s>RAMs which usually need thin lossy sheet thickness convert the electromagnetic energy (EM) to heat with frequency and incident angle dependence behavior.</s>
            <s>Also, the shaping method is based on redirecting the scattered waves from the target by changing its geometrical shape which has some practical drawbacks such as changing the target aerodynamic properties 1 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Recently, a new method has been proposed in 2,3 based on wave redirecting concept by combination of artificial magnetic conductors (AMC) and perfect electric conductors (PEC) tiles in chessboard like configuration.</s>
            <s>In this method, while the PEC tiles reflect the wave out-phase, the AMC tiles behave as perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) and reflect the wave in-phase in limited bandwidth which create destructive interferences cancellation and RCS reduction, consequently.</s>
            <s>To increase the RCS reduction bandwidth, two different AMC unit cells have been used instead of AMC-PEC configuration in 4-6 .</s>
            <s>In these structures, the phase difference of the reflected wave from the AMC unit cells is 180° ± 37° in wide bandwidth which results in more than 10-dB RCS reduction.</s>
            <s>For example, two different AMC unit cells have been proposed in 4 results in 85% 10-dB RCS reduction bandwidth.</s>
            <s>In 6 , a topology optimization algorithm was employed to design two different AMC unit cells with 95% RCS reduction bandwidth by using two layers structure.</s>
            <s>Using more than two AMC unit cells and special arrangements can be employed to enhance the RCS reduction bandwidth as discussed in 7-10 .</s>
            <s>Recently, authors proposed two and three layers AMC metasurface with 108% and 109% RCS reduction, respectively 11,12 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Another method of RCS reduction is using of polarization conversion metasurfaces (PCM) that convert the incident waves to its cross-polarized ones which can employ to scattered waves cancellation 13-15 .</s>
            <s>A 3-bit coding metasurface has been introduced in 16 for RCS reduction across wide frequency bandwidth.</s>
            <s>A low RCS metasurface has been designed based on the optimization algorithm and far-field scattering pattern analysis where the RCS reduction achieved from 7 GHz to 14 GHz 17 .</s>
            <s>A one-dimensional metasurface based on size-adjustable meta-atoms with ultra-wideband specular reflection reduction has been designed in 18 , also.</s>
            <s>These structures have been used in terahertz, also 19 .</s>
            <s>The double arrows unit cell has been used in 13 to perform polarization conversion metasurface in wide bandwidth, 85%.</s>

The proposed PCM RCS reducer surface with overall dimensions 200 mm × 200 mm composed of an ultra thin low cost commercially available FR-4 substrate placed on top of a ground plane. The arrow PCM unit cells print on top layer of the FR-4 substrate with h 1 = 0.25 mm thickness while the bottom copper of the substrate is removed, completely. This layer is spaced by an air gap from the ground copper sheet with small Teflon spacers</figDesc>
