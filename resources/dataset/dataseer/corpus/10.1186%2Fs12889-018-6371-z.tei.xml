        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>In the United States alone, 82 million households used insecticides in 2012 and $2.65 billion were spent in the "home and garden sector", representing 50% of all expenditures on insecticides <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One of the most prominent pests targeted with insecticides is the German cockroach (Blattella germanica).</s>
          <s>There are many reasons for eliminating indoor cockroach infestations, but primary among them is the central role that cockroaches play as etiological agents in allergic disease and asthma <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Allergens produced by German cockroaches can trigger allergies and asthma in sensitized individuals, and the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study found that asthma morbidity was highest in children that experienced both a positive skin-test response and high exposure to cockroach allergens <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing, a nationwide survey conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD), found detectable levels of the cockroach allergen Bla g 1 in 63% of homes <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , with higher concentrations in high-rise apartments, urban settings, older homes, and low-income households <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, because cockroaches move freely between waste and food, they can acquire, carry, and disseminate pathogenic bacteria, helminths, fungi, protozoa, and viruses in their digestive system <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the persistence of cockroaches in homes poses significant health risks to humans.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Indoor cockroach infestations are often targeted with residual liquid or aerosol sprays that contain broad-spectrum insecticides, most commonly pyrethroids <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, high levels of resistance to pyrethroids and their repellency to cockroaches severely compromise the efficacy of most residual sprays <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, these products can deposit considerable insecticide residues throughout the home <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s cert="0.8587785959243774" id="dataset-4" type="Tabular data">Environmental data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and HUD on a stratified, nationally representative sample of 1131 residences found extensive pesticide residues in homes <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite the continual use of residual sprays, insecticides formulated as baits offer more effective and safer alternatives in cockroach interventions <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Because professional pest control interventions can be prohibitively expensive, consumer-based pesticide products are commonly used in do-it-yourself (DIY) pest control, especially in low-income homes.</s>
          <s>Total-release foggers (TRFs) are often deployed as spatial insecticides, designed to fill a room with fine particles of aerosolized insecticide.</s>
          <s>They are considered by consumers to be highly effective against all pests (as the common name "bug bomb" implies).</s>
          <s>TRFs generally contain toxicity category III (based on acute toxicity) active ingredients (pyrethrins and pyrethroids), various synergists meant to inhibit microsomal detoxification by insects, and aerosol propellants that are often flammable.</s>
          <s>These products are responsible for substantial acute and chronic health effects, explosions and fires, and persistent environmental contamination indoors.</s>
          <s>These effects were first characterized by a 2008 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that summarized 466 fogger exposures in eight States over a five-year period, documenting respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, ocular, dermatologic, and cardiovascular adverse symptoms <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A similar summary from Texas, USA documented 2855 fogger exposures over an 8-year period <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite these reports, the magnitude of health, economic, and environmental damage is poorly documented, and likely underestimated.</s>
          <s>Indeed, a follow-up report from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, USA <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> stated that the 2008 CDC report understated reported exposures.</s>
          <s>This follow-up report also showed that health effects are much more likely to occur from exposures to TRFs than from other pesticide formulations, and moderate or major health effects were more than twice as likely to occur from TRF exposures as from all pesticides, and seven times as likely as from rodenticides.</s>
          <s>While many of the fogger-associated illnesses and injuries result from inadvertent exposures during their deployment (leaving the premises too late, re-entering too soon, discharging too many foggers, failing to notify others), studies suggest that TRFs deposit large amounts of insecticides in areas easily accessible to humans, especially small children <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The residual pyrethroids on household surfaces can exacerbate a number of chronic health conditions <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> , although the health effects from chronic exposure are still under debate.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>TRF products appear to contribute significantly to the disproportional pesticide exposure already documented for those living in affordable housing <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The report from New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> contends that "the health risks associated with the use of foggers are not justified given their likely poor efficacy".</s>
          <s>Recently, Jones and Bryant <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> showed that over-the-counter TRFs were indeed ineffective at controlling bed bug infestations.</s>
          <s>Surprisingly however, there are no reports on the relative efficacy of modern TRF products against their primary target, the German cockroach.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we designed a study to assess the efficacy and exposure risks of TRFs in cockroach-infested homes.</s>

        <head>TRFs are ineffective at reducing German cockroach infestations</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study provides the first concurrent documentation of the risks associated with TRFs and the ineffectiveness of TRFs at controlling German cockroaches.</s>
          <s>All TRF products evaluated failed to reduce cockroach populations, providing to our knowledge the first conclusive in-home evidence that these products are inappropriate tools for abatement of German cockroach infestations.</s>
          <s>Results from population monitoring with traps provided insight into the ineffectiveness of the TRF intervention under "real world" conditions.</s>
          <s>To test the efficacy of TRFs under ideal conditions, we used laboratory-reared and apartment-collected The overall ineffectiveness of TRFs may be caused by any one or combination of the following factors.</s>
          <s>First, pyrethroid insecticides are known to be repellent to cockroaches <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While the sentinel cockroaches could not escape the insecticide deposits from TRFs, the wild cockroaches could behaviorally avoid the insecticide residues.</s>
          <s>Second, aerosolized particles from TRFs likely failed to reach places where cockroaches normally shelter.</s>
          <s>We found relatively little insecticide residues on walls near the TRF discharge sites, compared to horizontal surfaces.</s>
          <s>Since cockroaches are often found under horizontal surfaces (e.g., under the kitchen sink, under countertops, under shelves), they likely avoid the large insecticide deposits on the tops of horizontal surfaces.</s>
          <s>Finally, and most significantly, extensive and pervasive pyrethroid resistance has evolved in German cockroach populations over the last 3 decades <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , rendering even residual spray formulations, which deliver pyrethroids directly to aggregation and foraging sites, ineffective in cockroach abatement <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The differential mortality of the insecticide-susceptible laboratory cockroaches and the adjacent wild cockroaches in open-topped cages suggests that the latter might be resistant to pyrethroid insecticides.</s>

        <head>TRFs deposit substantial insecticide residues</head>
        <p>
          <s>All TRF products significantly elevated insecticide residues in homes.</s>
          <s>With an average increase in insecticide residues of over 600-fold (median 85-fold) for all TRF products, insecticide active ingredients, and horizontal surfaces, it is clear that TRFs can cause significant insecticide contamination in homes.</s>
          <s>Although the insecticide residues declined after one month, significantly higher levels, relative to baseline, persisted on &gt; 34% of kitchen surfaces.</s>
          <s>Our results for cypermethrin residues on horizontal surfaces (0.13-0.75 Î¼g/cm 2 , depending on the TRF product and substrate) were comparable to those of Keenan et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> who found 0.07-0.38</s>
          <s>Î¼g/cm 2 after a similar TRF discharge.</s>
          <s>TRF deposits were also found to settle relatively evenly on all horizontal surfaces (floor: 0.5 m and 1 m from the TRF; countertop; upper cabinet) 4-6 h after discharge, and much less on walls, also shown by Keenan et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The high concentrations of pesticide residues in the middle of the kitchen floor, where cockroaches do not aggregate and seldom forage, and low deposits on vertical surfaces where cockroaches often aggregate <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , likely contributed to the ineffectiveness of TRFs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Considering the extensive deposits of insecticides from the discharge of a single TRF, it is not surprising that many studies, including ours, have found quantifiable "baseline" amounts of a variety of pesticides in homes (including pyrethroids and PBO), without implementing any pest control intervention <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>

            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A comparison of the floor baseline results from the current study with those reported by Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> reveals some notable trends.</s>
          <s>First, detection frequencies for all TRF active ingredients were either the same or higher in our study compared with Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our study found higher detection rates for PBO and cypermethrin, while detection rates for permethrin and tetramethrin were within 5%.</s>
          <s>However, Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> detected fipronil more often.</s>
          <s>Our MDLs were generally higher than reported by Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> , who also sampled surfaces almost 10-fold larger than we did, which could account for our lower incidence of detecting fipronil residues at baseline.</s>
          <s>For three other insecticides, however, the geometric means were 6-(permethrin), 199-(PBO), and 237-times (cypermethrin) higher in the current study than in Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> (fipronil and tetramethrin were not compared because both were detected at low frequencies in our study).</s>
          <s>The prevalence of pyrethroid insecticides on kitchen surfaces is particularly remarkable because all our recruited homes were in low-income housing complexes and of lower socio-economic status (SES).</s>
          <s>In contrast, the homes sampled by Stout et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> represented a random sample of public and private housing units across the U.S. The disparity of these respective studies appears to support previous findings of disproportionate pesticide exposure risks associated with lower SES <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Future work should focus on better understanding the relationship between pesticide exposure risk and SES.</s>

        <head>Baits: High efficacy and low pesticide residues</head>
        <p>
          <s>In contrast to the TRF formulations, both consumer-based gel bait (Combat) and professional gel bait (Maxforce) were highly effective at reducing the cockroach infestations, as expected based on previous uses of this strategy to mitigate German cockroaches and cockroach-produced allergens <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the current study, baits were used alone, independently of all other integrated pest management (IPM) tactics.</s>
          <s>Although cockroach reduction was significant among all bait treated homes, populations were not completely eradicated within one month.</s>
          <s>It is important to note that for complete eradication, inspection and treatment (baiting) would need to continue for longer than the one-month period of this study <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, fipronil (the active ingredient in both bait products) was not detected in swabs in any of the bait-treated apartments, consistent with the findings of Williams et al. <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> that indoor environments under IPM programs involving baits had much lower pesticide residues compared with traditional spray treatments.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, both TRFs and baits were similarly priced (see <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">Table 4</ref> ), indicating that cost should not factor into the decision regarding which product to use.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our effective use of gel baits as a single monitoring-guided intervention, independent of other IPM tactics (e.g., caulking, sanitation, cleaning, trapping), is consistent with an emergent body of literature showing that proper use of baits constitutes the most cost-effective intervention to mitigate the harmful effects of cockroaches and their allergens [reviews <ref type="bibr">: 2, 7]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>It has been over 25 years since Fenske <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> suggested several strategies to mitigate risks associated with indoor pesticide applications, including that "product registrations could be modified or withdrawn for specific applications if an acceptable level of risk cannot be demonstrated."</s>
          <s>Although his work focused on active ingredients that in fact have been withdrawn from indoor use, the narrative remains the same -TRF products are depositing large amounts of insecticide residues throughout the home.</s>
          <s>We now show that TRFs provide no benefits for abatement of German cockroach infestations.</s>
          <s>Their associated societal costs, lack of observable benefits, and the availability of highly efficacious, affordable, and environmentally sound alternatives, such as baits, challenge the continued registration and persistence of TRF products in the consumer market.</s>

        <head>Study limitations</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study had several limitations, none of which undermine our conclusions.</s>
          <s>First, this study was limited to a relatively small sample size of homes treated with TRFs, because of IRB concerns with the invasiveness and expected low efficacy of this intervention.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, the sample size provided strong statistical power and showed highly significant differences in pesticide residues on hard surfaces in homes and in the efficacy of pest control options.</s>
          <s>Second, the homes sampled were located within a single city (Raleigh, NC, U.S.A.), potentially raising reservations whether our findings may be generalized globally.</s>
          <s>It is important to note that the apartments within this city represented a broad range of independent and unrelated low-income apartment complexes, and pervious research showed a general lack of gene flow among cockroaches in different apartment complexes and no pattern of isolation-by-distance <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> , suggesting that these five apartment complexes represented independent cockroach populations.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, our conclusions are generalizable to a global scale because they are supported by (a) residue sampling from 2009 to 2010 in California, with essentially identical active ingredients <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> , and (b) surveys documenting pyrethroid resistance in cockroaches on a global scale <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref>
