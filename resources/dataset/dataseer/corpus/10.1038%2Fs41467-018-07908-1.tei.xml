          <s>After some systematic screening on the ligands, solvents, Pd sources, and bases, we observed that the reaction of allenyl acetate 1a-OAc 49-51 with diethyl malonate catalyzed by [Pd(Ï€-cinnamyl)Cl)] 2 and (R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOS with K 2 CO 3 as base in NMP at 30Â°C afforded the 1,3-disubstituted allene (R a )-3a-Et with 69% ee and 64% yield (Entry 1, <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1)</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32</ref> (defined as Procedure A).</s>
          <s>The reaction of allenyl carbonate 1a <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref>
            <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50]</ref>
            <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[51]</ref> with diethyl malonate afforded (R a )-3a-Et with a same level of ee although the yield was much higher (80%) (Entry 2, <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the reaction following the Procedure B leading to a lower ee (60%) was observed (Entry 3, <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Thus, we further adjusted the mixing sequence of the reactants and catalyst(s) and found that by using Procedure C, in which racemic allene substrate 1a was added at the end of the procedure, quite interestingly and unexpectedly, a much higher enantioselectivity of 87% was observed (Entry 4, <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Running the reaction at 5Â°C led to an ee of 90% and a yield of 85% for (R a )-3aa (Entry 5, <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We also evaluated the effect of the R group in malonate on the enantioselectivity (Entries 7-9, Table 1), confirming the steric effect of the parent malonate has no obvious effect.</s>

          <s>Substrate scope.</s>
          <s>After establishing the optimal reaction conditions, the scope of allene substrates with the much less sterically hindered yet synthetically versatile 2-non-substituted dimethyl malonate was investigated elaborately.</s>
          <s>Allenylic carbonates 1 bearing a linear 1Â°-alkyl (R 1 ) group reacted with dimethyl malonate 2a to afford (R a )-3 with excellent ee values in good to excellent yields: Entries 1-9 showed that this protocol is very general for the different length of the carbon chain of R 1 ranging from Me to n-C 11 H 23 .</s>
          <s>Common and practical protecting groups for the hydroxyl group, such as Bn, Î±-naphthylmethyl, and TBS, are also viable in this transformation affording allenes (R a )-3ja, 3ka, and 3la in the ee value of 91%, 91%, and 92%, respectively (Entries 10, 11 and 12, <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Expectedly, 1m with a secondary R 1 group (Cy) and 1p with t-Bu afforded (R a )-3ma and (R a )-3pa with a slightly higher enantioselectivity, indicating again that the steric effect is not the major determining factor for ee (Entries 13-14, <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Due to the unclosed nature of the malonate unit, these products 3aa-3pa could be used for further sewing of useful and versatile organosegment(s) to make new chiral allenes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Next we turned to investigate the reaction of 2,3-allenylic carbonates with more sterically hindered 2-substituted malonates <ref target="#tab_3" type="table">(Table 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Generally, 2-substituted malonates gave the desired (R a )-3 with higher ee values as expected, and synthetically attractive allyl, allenyl, propargyl, 3-phenylpropargyl are all compatible.</s>
          <s>The installation of such unsaturated C-C units in chiral (R a )-3 elaborated the practical utilities of this approach via subsequent cycloaddition reaction, radical reaction, or cascade reaction, forming other chiral chemicals <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref>

          <s>A linear correlation between the ee of ligand and ee of 3aa was observed <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5a)</ref> , which indicated that the active catalytic species was a monomeric palladium complex bearing a single chiral ligand <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[62]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>, after removal of THF via evaporation and recrystalization from CH 2 Cl 2 /n-hexane, (R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOSÂ·PdCl 2 Â·2CH 2 Cl 2 was obtained as confirmed by X-ray diffraction study <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, no desired product was formed for the reaction of 1f and 2a with (R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOSÂ·PdCl 2 Â·2CH 2 Cl 2 as the catalyst: 92% yield of 1f was recovered, indicating that (R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOSÂ·PdCl 2 Â·2CH 2 Cl 2 is NOT the catalyst or pre-catalyst <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5c</ref> ).</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the unique effect of the procedure for mixing these chemicals was re-confirmed ( <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 5d)</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been reported that an allene unit may also function as ligand <ref target="#b66" type="bibr">67,</ref>
            <ref target="#b67" type="bibr">68</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, we reasoned that it is most likely that the allene unit in the stoichiometric amount of racemic 1f may compete with (R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as ligand for extensive coordination with the palladium atom, leading to a lower ee (Procedure B).</s>
          <s>In fact, it was confirmed by the fact that a lower loading of the chiral ligand led to a lower ee <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Fig. 5e</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In addition, when Pd 2 (dba) 3 Â·CHCl 3 was used instead of [Pd(Ï€-cinnamyl)Cl)] 2 , the reaction gave a similar enantioselectivity albeit with a much lower yield, indicating that Pd(0) is indeed the catalytically active species and the in-situ generated Pd(0) is much more reactive <ref target="#b68" type="bibr">69</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, a working model for the prediction of the axial chirality was proposed <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The monomeric palladium complex bearing a single chiral ligand, PdL*, would react with both (R a )-1 and (S a )-1 via S N 2â€²-type oxidative addition from the back side of the C-OCO 2 Me bond to generate the same most favored E-Î· 1 -dienyl Pd, which would immediately yield the most favored delocalized intermediate Î±-alkynylidene-Ï€-allyl palladium syn-Î· 3 -int A 70 via the Ïƒ-Ï€ rearrangement involving the coordination of the terminal olefin with Pd.</s>
          <s>The front side of the terminal carbon atom in syn-Î· 3 -int A is blocked by L* ((R)-(âˆ’)-DTBM-SEGPHOS), thus, the malonate anion of 2 depronated by a base would attack from the back side the C-Pd bond in syn-Î· 3 -int A to genetate the chiral allene 3 in R configuration.</s>
