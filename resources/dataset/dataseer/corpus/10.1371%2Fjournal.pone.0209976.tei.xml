        <p>
          <s>Speech recognition and auditory comprehension are some of the most important activities encountered in everyday life.</s>
          <s>In everyday communication situations, human listeners rely on a variety of perceptual strategies to segregate the attended target speech from background competing sounds.</s>
          <s>Intonation has many perceptually significant functions in language that contribute to the comprehension and recognition of speech <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Specifically, intonation cues are important for conveying the intended meaning of clusters of discourse <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[3]</ref> and deliver information at levels higher than the word.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The literature has investigated the role of intonation in speech intelligibility by flattening the fundamental frequency (F0) contours of normal speech and comparing the recognition of these stimuli to naturally intonated speech <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The findings within these studies have indicated a detrimental effect of flattening the F0 contour on sentence intelligibility.</s>
          <s>Among the explanations proposed for these findings was that the rise and fall of the F0 contour has been found to <ref type="bibr">PLOS</ref> direct the listener's attention to the content words of the utterance; therefore, without these cues, the intelligibility of the utterance decreases <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">Binns and Culling (2007)</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[5]</ref> also assessed the role intonation contours play in speech intelligibility by manipulating the F0 contours.</s>
          <s>The manipulations involved either reducing the F0 incrementally from the variation present in a normally intonated contour to a flattened contour (where the variation has been removed), with no variation, or a complete inversion of the F0 contour.</s>
          <s>They found that naturally varying F0 contours improved speech intelligibility in background noise compared with flat or inverted F0 contours, and their results also indicated that reducing the amount of F0 variation has a progressively detrimental effect on speech intelligibility.</s>
          <s>The authors suggested that in the flattened F0 condition, the words all had the same F0 and lacked the important stress-based segmentation cue <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , thus, the stress cues based on F0 were simply neutralized across the individual words in the sentences as opposed to being inaccurate or misleading.</s>
          <s>Therefore, in one argumentation, the speech utterance with the absence of F0 variation has lower intelligibility than speech with normal F0 variation.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">Binns and Culling (2007)</ref> discussed that where there is an F0 contour in the right direction, the focused words may remain focused, to some degree, and the surrounding contour still guides the listener toward those words more readily than in a flattened F0 condition.</s>
          <s>Their results showed that even a small amount of F0 modulation (m = 0.25) increased the intelligibility of the sentences against a single-talker interferer, indicating it is the contour shape that is important to speech recognition.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the literature has demonstrated that humans with hearing impairment require greater F0 variation in speech to follow intonation patterns compared with humans with normal hearing <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The aforementioned results of these studies led to one of the hypotheses in this study: an exaggerated F0 contour may improve performance relative to a decreased F0 variation condition.</s>
          <s>In addition, if a greater moment-to-moment variation in the F0 contour exists, the intelligibility of the speech utterance increases; according to our review of the literature, this phenomenon has not been well documented.</s>
          <s>In other words, whether the greater F0 variation in the contour may have greater benefits for speech intelligibility is still not clear and requires further analysis.</s>
          <s>Considering this information, we questioned whether exaggerating the F0 contour to some degree could affect the speech intelligibility.</s>
          <s>Thus, one of the purposes of this study was to investigate whether an exaggerated F0 affects the speech intelligibility relative to the naturally produced speech utterance as much as a reduction of F0 modulation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Furthermore, a noise background was used in <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">Binns and Culling (2007)</ref> , and the speech recognition thresholds were measured in interfering speech or in speech-shaped noise.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">Binns and Culling (2007)</ref> observed that flattened speech degraded speech intelligibility relative to typically intonated speech, and this difference did not reach significance when using a speechshaped background noise masker.</s>
          <s>However, the authors did find a significant difference in speech intelligibility between the two conditions when the masker's interfering speech had a variety of F0 contours (e.g., flattened F0, normal F0, and inverse F0).</s>
          <s>In <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">Laures and Bunton (2003)</ref> , the unmodified and flattened F0 utterances masked by non-speech (white noise) or speech-like (multi-speaker babble) noise was examined to obtain the measures of speech intelligibility.</s>
          <s>Most notably, their results found that utterances with a flattened F0 contour were less intelligible than utterances with a varying F0 in noisy conditions, regardless of the type of noise <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence, in terms of interferers, the effect of intonation on speech intelligibility under adverse listening conditions still requires further investigation.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">Brungart et al. (2001)</ref> showed that using the same talker for the target and the interferer generated more masking than using a different talker of the same sex, which created more of a masking effect than using a talker of the opposite sex.</s>
          <s>The proposed cause of this effect is the increase in informational masking, because the number of voices is initially increased to two voices; then, a consequent decrease as the number of voices increases to three <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the two-talker babble has a much greater negative effect than the multi-talker babble.</s>
          <s>Therefore, according to the results in <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">Brungart et al. (2001)</ref> , in this study, the masker was speech-like (e.g., two-speaker babble) or a continuous nature (e.g., white noise) was used to simulate the effect on speech intelligibility in an adverse listening background.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Notably, most of the aforementioned studies have been conducted using English stimuli and English listeners.</s>
          <s>Few studies have been conducted on tonal languages.</s>
          <s>In a tonal language such as Mandarin Chinese, F0 serves as the primary acoustic cue for both lexical tones and sentence intonation, and the syllable varies in tones which make the contour of sentence intonation colourful and varied.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In a study with Mandarin Chinese stimuli, sentences with flattened F0 and normal F0 contours were used to investigate the importance of F0 variation for Mandarin speech comprehension; notably, the results showed that sentences with flattened F0 contours were as intelligible as those with normal F0 patterns in a quiet environment <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">Wang et al. (2013)</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> indicated that the speech materials used in <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">Patel et al., (2010)</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> were semantically predictable meaningful sentences, and because the top-down information of the sentence context would provide a crucial role in guiding speech perception <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , what contributed to the unchanged intelligibility of monotonous Mandarin sentences with flattened F0 contours in quiet was unclear <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> further evaluated speech intelligibility of the Mandarin sentences and word lists with or without F0 variations, and the results showed that listeners can automatically use additional neural and cognitive resources to recover disrupted F0 contour patterns in sentences.</s>
          <s>Particularly, significant interactions existed among the three factors (i.e., sentence context, F0 variation, and background noise) in the intelligibility of Mandarin speech.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since there was evidence that the semantic information provided by sentence context contributes to speech intelligibility in <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> , in this study, Chinese "nonsense" sentences <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">14]</ref> , which were syntactically correct but not semantically meaningful, was used in this study to ensure that the listeners can't make relatively use of contextual cues to predict the keywords in the sentences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In summary, the present study were intended to clarify whether the tone information for Mandarin Chinese was preserved but the intonation information was manipulated (flattened or exaggerated) could affect the ability to understand speech in the presence of two types of interfering sounds, speech masker and noise masker.</s>
          <s>Specifically, speech recognition in noise was measured for Mandarin sentences having a typical F0 contour, a decreased F0 contour, or an exaggerated F0 contour, and the effects by decreasing the amount of F0 variation present in a standard contour of Mandarin Chinese sentences along with exaggerating the F0 contour was investigated.</s>

          <s>The target speech was recited by an artificially synthesized young, female voice.</s>
          <s>The generation of artificially synthesized target speech signal was briefly described as follows: First, a news-broadcast style Chinese corpus (Blizzard Challenge 2009) was sampled for model training, and then some critical speech-acoustical parameters (including the mel-cepstrum,log F0, and band aperiodicity measures and so on.)</s>
          <s>were extracted and the five-state left-to right Hidden Markov Model structure was adopted.</s>
          <s>Second, the speech-parameter sequence for each sentence stimulus was generated from the corresponding Hidden Markov Model, and then a speech waveform was synthesized using the algorithm of the Mel Log Spectrum Approximation Filter with the generated parameters, and finally, the initial acoustical model was established by a training procedure using the speech corpus with selected vocal characteristics.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Speech samples (about 432 sentences and lasting 40 min) were processed by the initial acoustic model as described above to obtain the acoustical model for each of the target voices with different intonation pattern(see details in the following section Synthesized intonation speech).</s>

        <p>
          <s>This study used different intonation cues to examine the speech unmasking effect of intonation perception.</s>
          <s>The results of this study supports earlier findings that any unnatural F0 contour manipulation decreased speech understanding in background noise <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This notion that the F0 contour is important in degraded speech understanding was also supported by the finding that, in this study, pilot listeners performed equally well across all three conditions when the sentences were presented in a quiet condition.</s>
          <s>When the stimuli were presented in noise, performance dropped.</s>
          <s>This finding is also in accord with the speculation proposed in the study by <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , who asserted that when the entire speech is degraded, listeners seem to rely more heavily on the F0 contour.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Specifically, the results of this study revealed that when presented in quiet, the speech perception of Chinese nonsense sentences with flattened F0 contours were as intelligible as those with natural F0 contours.</s>
          <s>By contrast, when presented in either noise or a speech masker condition, flattening the F0 contours of Chinese nonsense sentences dramatically reduced the intelligibility compared with the sentences with natural F0 contours.</s>
          <s>These results show a substantial contribution of F0 contour to sentence recognition under a noise environment.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results in this study also highlighted the importance of natural F0 contours for sentence intelligibility, which were consistent with previous findings in <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10,</ref>

        <head>Unfamiliar intonation contour decreases releasing Chinese speech from masking</head>
        <p>
          <s>The results indicated that recognition of the final keywords was much better under the typical intonation condition than that under the flattened or exaggerated intonation condition, suggesting that an unfamiliar intonation contour slows releasing Chinese speech from masking.</s>
          <s>The results were consistent with <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[28]</ref> , indicating that an unfamiliar intonation contour has a robust detrimental effect on the processing of speech.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since all the redundant fine phonetic details including intonation are the lexical representation of words <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[29]</ref> , an unfamiliar contour-to some extent-could result in some type of mismatch between the lexical representation and the perceived word, leading to the reduced word recognition.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>According to our review of the literature, the information on intonation is processed and interpreted as soon as it becomes available <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[30]</ref> ; thus, the increased difficulty in accessing the distorted intonation contour may result in bad performance for stimuli with an unfamiliar intonation contour.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results also support Huang and Holt (2009) who assert that general auditory processing plays a role in lexical tone perception, that is, tone and intonation that share energy in the region of F0 but eliminate specific and speech-specific information should elicit similar effects on Mandarin tone perception <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Moreover, in Mandarin Chinese, lexical tones and intonation both depend on the variation of pitch.</s>
          <s>The speakers varied in F0 contour (i.e., how F0 changes during an utterance), and those differences in F0 contours between a target speaker and competing speakers can facilitate the tracking of the target voice when there are competing voices <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results of this study showed that a flattened F0 contour within an individual sentence negatively influences the accuracy of speech recognition under the masking condition, regardless of the masker type.</s>
          <s>The results also indicated that the flattened fundamental frequency lowers releasing speech from masking, because it reduced the contrast between words and decreased the intelligibility of the utterance, which made it more difficult to parse continuous speech into meaningful units in a noisy environment.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Moreover, the results indicated that the intelligibility of speech under exaggerated intonation condition was worse than that under the flattened intonation condition whenever there is noise masker or speech masker, moreover, the exaggerated intonation suffers more in the speech-masker condition than that in the noise-masker condition.</s>

      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Except for the lexical tone contour, intonation information is also important for Chinese speech intelligibility</head>
        <p>
          <s>The results indicated that speech in a tone language (Mandarin Chinese) is harder to understand when the intonation is unnatural, even if you preserve tone information.</s>
          <s>That is, in addition to the lexical tone contour information, intonation information is also important for the Mandarin Chinese speech recognition.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Most of the research paradigms examining speech unmasking use task instructions that direct the listener to a semantic cue, often a key word within the target signal <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study found that under a noise environment the participants also use indexical (tone in the voice, sentence intonation) cues to find the target utterance.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As in tonal languages, each monosyllable is pronounced with a distinctive tone that denotes a specific lexical meaning.</s>
          <s>In Mandarin Chinese, fundamental frequency serves as the primary acoustic cue for lexical tones and sentence intonation.</s>
          <s>Except for the lexical tone contour, sentence intonation is also important for the recognition of Mandarin sentences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Patel et al,(2010) revealed that lexical prediction played an important role in helping the speech perception system compensate for lack of pitch variation, and top-down knowledge was helpful for enabling a listener to quickly realize the lexical intent of a spoken utterance and remap the vowel space <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">36]</ref> ; thus, this study used non-semantic and meaningless Chinese nonsense utterances.</s>
          <s>One of the innovative features of this study was that each utterance was subjected to a re-synthesis technique that allowed flattening or exaggerating of the fundamental frequency while maintaining the timing and spectral characteristics of the utterances.</s>
          <s>In addition, different from English utterances, in Mandarin Chinese, the utterance of each syllable has its own pitch contour, and the pitch contour is more uniform across syllables.</s>
          <s>Notably, there seemed to be greater time-to-time variation in F0 in a Mandarin Chinese utterance than in an English utterance.</s>
          <s>Future studies could be conducted to help ascertain whether there is a difference between the Chinese and English utterances in the effective use of the intonation cues across the two languages.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results of this study attempt to provide useful insights into the future development of speech communication applications, and the synthesis of intonation cues investigated in this study could be used to enhance the listener's ability to extract information from target speech masked by simultaneous competing talkers in an interactive speech system.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study investigated the extent to which listeners can use intonation information to identify and selectively attend to a Chinese nonsense target utterance in noise and whether intonation cues affect the unmasking of Mandarin speech.</s>
          <s>The results of this study showed that recognition of the final keywords in the target sentence was much better under the typical intonation condition than under the flattened intonation condition or exaggerated intonation condition whenever there was a noise masker or a speech masker, suggesting that a flattened F0 contour or exaggerated F0 contour within an individual sentence negatively influences the accuracy of speech recognition under the noisy environment.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the results indicated that the performance under the flattened intonation condition was better than under the exaggerated intonation condition when there was a noise masker; however, the performance under the flattened intonation condition didn't differ significantly from the exaggerated intonation condition when the masker was speech.</s>
          <s>These results revealed that listeners can take advantage of the troughs in the intonation of the Chinese speech masker to gain a "glimpse" of the Chinese target signal.</s>
