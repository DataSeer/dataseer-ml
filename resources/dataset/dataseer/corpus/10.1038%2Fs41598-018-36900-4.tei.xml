            <s>Understanding the degradation mechanisms of lead-halide perovskites (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) under exposure to liquid/aerosol water is an essential problem within the photovoltaic community.</s>
            <s>Herein we investigate both the static and the dynamic properties of the methylammonuim cation (MA) as it coordinates with invading water molecules (MA.(H 2 O) n , n = 1, 2, 3, 4) using both stationary state quantum mechanics and first principle molecular dynamics simulations.</s>
            <s>Various solvation structures of MA were characterized by their stabilization energies, dipoles, and Maximally-Localized Wannier Function (MLWF) centers.</s>
            <s>Calculation -and analysis -of vibrational shifts in the IR spectral region were performed for hydrated complexes; the locations of NH 3 + stretching vibrations allude to significant hydrogen bonding between MA and the water molecules.</s>
            <s>Through Fourier analysis of the rotational dynamics on several MA · (H 2 O)n complexes, we conclude that the water molecules dampen the rotational motion of the MA as the intermolecular bonds formed between the water molecules and the MA act to hinder the rotation of the cation; these findings give explanatory support to earlier computational observations of humidity effects on perovskites (i.e., CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) materials.</s>
            <s>This work is a step toward understanding the water-MA cation interaction in bulk perovskites, thus providing greater understanding of in situ instability/degradation of perovskite bulk materials.</s>

            <s>Lead halide perovskites such as CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 ) (MA ≡ Methyl-ammonium) are key candidate materials for energy conversion from light to electricity 1 .</s>
            <s>However, these materials suffer from instabilities owing to decomposition upon exposure to water vapor, humid air and ultraviolet (UV) radiation 2-4 .</s>
            <s>The crystal structure of lead halide perovskites (MAPbI 3 ) can be seen as the deposition product between the two charged species: (PbI 3 ) − and MA + (CH 3 NH 3 ) +5-7 .</s>
            <s>It has been suggested that MAPbI 3 decomposes into PbI 2 and MAI; where MAI further dissociates into iodine, hydrogen, HI and water 8 .</s>
            <s>This decomposition reaction is considered to be proceeded by a strong interaction between H 2 O and MA via an −  H O H N 2 intermolecular bond in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 + (H 2 O)n (n is the number of water molecules), which leads to a decomposition of the [PbI 3 ] − cage containing the [CH 3 NH 3 ] + cation.</s>

            <s>Frost et al. proposed a decomposition pathway for MAPbI 3 considering the aqueous solubilities of MA and HI 10 , yet lead halide is insoluble 11 , while Qiu et al. proposed that the degradation progressed in two steps.</s>
            <s>Firstly, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 decomposes into aqueous CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 in the presence of H 2 O. CH 3 NH 3 I then decomposes into CH 3 NH 2 and HI, where HI may react with O 2 or may photodecompose into H 2 and I 2 6 .</s>
            <s>Improved photoluminescence of lead halide perovskite film after having been exposed to moisture has been reported; this improvement could be due to partial solvation of-or coordination of water with-the methyl-ammonium component 11 .</s>
            <s>Humidity effects on the perovskite materials suggest that infiltrating waters interact with the MA within the lead halid cage, as well as with the iodide lattice.</s>

          <s>The results of the Spectroscopy analysis.</s>
          <s>Spectroscopy analysis are very important to characterize the hydrogen bonding networks in water and for hydrated cations in water.</s>
          <s>These kind of analysis will allow us to characterize the hydrogen bonds between the (NH 3 ) + group of the MA and the water molecules, and also to capture the changes of N-H stretch vibration that are known for their sensitivity to the strength of hydrogen bond network.</s>

        <p>
          <s>To characterize the effects of hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the MA, we calculate the IR spectra for each MA ⋅ (H 2 O) n complex, determining energy shifts in vibrational modes due to solvation.</s>
          <s>We show in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> the vibrational spectrum for various isomers of the MA ⋅ (H 2 O) n hydrated complexes, namely the isomers given as subfigures (a), (b), (d), (g) in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. SI1</ref> , as well as the spectra of both MA and H 2 O.</s>
          <s>All the relevant bands appeared to be well pronounced in the computed spectra.</s>
          <s>The IR intensities for the particular modes discussed below are listed in <ref type="table">Table SIIV</ref> with their spectral assignments and frequencies.</s>
          <s>From the IR spectra, we find that there are roughly two regions which undergo pronounced alterations in their modes/frequencies during solvation and are separated by a small mid-energy region featuring stable characteristics.</s>
          <s>The first region lays in the lower energy domain, below ~900 cm −1 , where novel modes come about due to complex, collective intermolecular motions.</s>
          <s>An example of these modes would be the collective hindered rotations of h-bonding species in the realm of 500-850 cm −1 for all hydrated complexes, with pronounced subsequent peaks in the n = 4 case.</s>
          <s>Within the stable separation region, 900-1485 cm −1 , a number of modes do not directly interplay with the intermolecular bonds; examples being: N-C stretch and methyl bending modes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the higher frequency region, several atoms participate in modes directly involved in the intermolecular forces forming the hydrated complexes.</s>
          <s>The region of ~1500-1750 cm −1 is home to the bending modes of the n waters and the NH 3 bending modes; due to the proximity of these bands to each other-with the subsequent addition of more waters-their motions begin to couple, forming new bands which no longer strictly conform to their original spectroscopic assignments.</s>
          <s>These absorption bands are effectively blue shifted-as the optimized intermolecular structure sits at an energetic low point in conformation space-as they are the cause of geometric deformations from the optimized geometry.</s>
          <s>Additionally within this higher energy region, the CH 3 stretching modes have nearly no effect on the intermolecular bonding and display only slight shifts, yet are effected by the breaking of symmetry caused by NH 3 -associated waters in several hydrated complexes.</s>
          <s>The NH 3 stretching modes are capable of undergoing severe red shifting in cases where the hydrogen's vibratory motion is eased by the presence of another partially negatively charged atom (oxygen) when the vibratory motion is along an h-bond.</s>
          <s>(For verification, both the Muliken and NBO charges for all atoms within the hydrated complexes are given in Tables SIII and III) The high energy vibrations belonging to the water's stretching modes are capable of collectivizing their motions (minor red shifting), and being effected by h-bonding vectors (severe red shifting).</s>

          <s>Since both MA and water molecules are polar with 2.6 D 36 for water and 2.2 D for the MA <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore it is of our interest in this study to compute over the molecular dynamics simulations the total dipole moment of the different hydrated complexes to understand the changes of the dipole probability, the interaction between the MA and the water molecules, and the MA rotational behavior.</s>

          <s>Calculation and analysis of both the geometric and the dynamic properties have been carried out on several MA ⋅ (H 2 O)n isomers.</s>
          <s>These analysis confirmed that the nature of interaction is mostly electrostatic between the MA and the water molecule via h-bonding between the ammonium hydrogen and the oxygen of the water molecule.</s>
          <s>As the number of water molecules is increased, there is an increased chance that an isomer may form where a single water forms a hydrogen bond with another water (effectively forming a chain of hydrogen bonds leading to the ammonium); this dangling water may further stabilize the complex.</s>
          <s>The IR spectra were calculated to highlight the role of water on the dynamics of the MA, especially important concerning the vibrational modes of the amine N-H were the h-bonds are formed.</s>
          <s>Through comparative analysis of the dynamics associated with MA solvation by one or more water molecules, it may be suggested that the water molecules slow down the rotation of the MA molecule originated from the strong hydrogen bonding between the MA and the water molecules.</s>
          <s>This deceleration of MA's rotational dynamics was further elucidated-and verified-through a Fourier analysis of MA's polar coordinates with respect to a fixed series of axes.</s>
          <s>These results further suggest degradation of the performance of perovskite solar cells may originate from the slowing of the MA's rotational dynamics induced by water interactions, which does in fact affect the electron-hole recombination directly impacting performance of perovskites solar cells.</s>
