            <s>Background: Protein-based Cas9 in vivo gene editing therapeutics have practical limitations owing to their instability and low efficacy.</s>
            <s>To overcome these obstacles and improve stability, we designed a nanocarrier primarily consisting of lecithin that can efficiently target liver disease and encapsulate complexes of Cas9 with a single-stranded guide RNA (sgRNA) ribonucleoprotein (Cas9-RNP) through polymer fusion self-assembly.</s>

            <s>We then injected our nanocarrier Cas9-RNP complexes directly into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) db/db mice, which disrupted the expression of DPP-4 gene in T2DM mice with remarkable efficacy.</s>
            <s>The decline in DPP-4 enzyme activity was also accompanied by normalized blood glucose levels, insulin response, and reduced liver and kidney damage.</s>
            <s>These outcomes were found to be similar to those of sitagliptin, the current chemical DPP-4 inhibition therapy drug which requires recurrent doses.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) nuclease complexes have been established as tools for human genome engineering therapy <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>They are expected to facilitate drastic changes in the treatment of intractable genetic diseases <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, conventional methods of transfecting cells with plasmid DNA to encode singlestranded guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas nuclease exhibit critical limitations such as off-targeting, integration of foreign DNA, and toxicity due to the transfection agents <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Direct delivery of protein-based nucleases such as Cas9 or Cpf1 with sgRNA complexes is another possible therapeutic strategy, but it faces low encapsulation efficiency, poor cell membrane permeability, and proteolytic instability, especially in vivo <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As such, there is great need for a biocompatible vesicle carrier that can effectively encapsulate protein/sgRNA complexes.</s>
          <s>Liposomal particles are great candidate materials given their simple preparation method, easy surface modification, and high biocompatibility.</s>
          <s>For example, Wang et al. <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> have recently reported a bio-reducible lipid nanocarrier complex for protein-based Cas9 genome editing.</s>
          <s>It was produced through electrostatic interaction of cationic lipids and super-negatively charged complexes via protein-protein fusion.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was used as a target disease given its suitability for genetic therapy concerning liver.</s>
          <s>T2DM is a complex disease characterized by high glucose levels in the bloodstream, reduced glucose processing capacity in adipocytes, and insulin resistance in the body <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Elevating glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1), an important target hormone that stimulates insulin secretion, is one of recent therapeutic approaches <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, this hormone has a short half-life due to its extremely rapid degradation by enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To prevent GLP-1 degradation, various drugs inhibiting DPP-4 such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin have been developed for insulin-mediated glucose control of T2DM <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, since DPP-4 inhibitors are widely used in clinical practice, they are also investigated as potential new therapeutics against the development of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, smallmolecule antidiabetic drugs must be administered daily.</s>
          <s>In addition, they are associated with adverse effects such as hepatic impairment.</s>
          <s>A therapeutic method capable of effectively down-regulating DPP-4 enzyme with low side effects, such as a CRISPR/Cas9-based solution, would be an appropriate remedy for T2DM.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We prepared recombinant Cas9 nuclease complexes with an sgRNA as a ribonucleoprotein (Cas9-RNP) designed to edit the DPP-4 gene.</s>
          <s>To deliver the Cas9-RNP complex, a lecithin-based liposomal nanocarrier particle (NL) was developed.</s>
          <s>To increase encapsulation efficiency, a cationic polymer was integrated with the Cas9-RNP complex to compensate for the NL's negatively charged lipid structure.</s>
          <s>This is because loading efficiency is strongly dependent on electrostatic interactions <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, in consideration of biodistribution, NL are suitable for targeting liver diseases due to the natural metabolism of lecithin in the liver.</s>
          <s>Effects of Cas9-RNP incorporated NL were demonstrated by observing glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in T2DM mice.</s>

          <s>The encapsulation of Cas9-RNP complexes was enhanced by increasing the loading efficiency through fusion of a positively charged polymer.</s>
          <s>Spontaneous electrostatic interaction between charge-compensated complexes and negatively charged lipids resulted in self-assembly of NL spheres with uniform size distribution.</s>
          <s>Unlike unprotected protein therapeutic strategies that have low delivery efficacy due to enzymatic breakdown, our genome platform has exemplary biocompatibility with low cytotoxicity and high solution stability, making it optimal for genetic and chronic human disease therapies.</s>
          <s>As proof of concept, T2DM was selected as disease of focus.</s>
          <s>We designed a therapeutic strategy whereby the DPP-4 gene was disrupted by NL@Cas9-RNP delivery.</s>
          <s>We optimized an sgRNA sequence to target the DPP-4 gene.</s>
          <s>NL@Cas9-RNP successfully edited this gene with very low cytotoxicity.</s>
          <s>In db/db mice, NL@Cas9-RNP particle was able to decrease levels of DPP-4.</s>
          <s>Such disruption induced up-regulation of GLP-1 concentration in the blood.</s>
          <s>The Dotted circles indicate islet cores enhanced efficacy of the gene disruption effect might be attributed to extended retention of NL in the liver given that hepatocytes can effectively uptake lecithin-based NL particles.</s>
          <s>Down-regulation of DPP-4 by NL@Cas9-RNP treatment also reconciled glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in a manner similar to sitagliptin.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, blood analysis showed that unlike sitagliptin, NL@ Cas9-RNP treatment maintained normal liver and kidney function probably because of lessened drug dispensation.</s>
          <s>NL@Cas9-RNP can be applied as an effective treatment option for mitigating T2DM and its development.</s>
