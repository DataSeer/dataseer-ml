            <s>Introduction: Taking consecutive antibiotic use into account is of importance to obtain insight in treatment within disease episodes, use of 2nd-and 3rd-choice antibiotics, therapy failure and/or side effects.</s>
            <s>Nevertheless, studies dealing with consecutive antibiotic use are scarce.</s>
            <s>We aimed at evaluating switch patterns in antibiotic use in the outpatient setting in the Netherlands.</s>
            <s>Methods: Outpatient antibiotic dispensing data was processed to antibiotic treatment episodes consisting of single prescriptions or consecutive prescriptions (2006 to 2014).</s>
            <s>Consecutive prescriptions were categorised into prolongations and switches.</s>
            <s>Switches were further analysed to obtain antibiotic switch percentages and trends over time.</s>
            <s>Outcomes were compared with recommendations of Dutch guidelines.</s>
            <s>Results: A total of 43,179,867 antibiotic prescriptions were included in the analysis, consisting of single prescriptions (95%) , prolongations (2%) and switches (3%).</s>
            <s>The highest switch percentages were found for trimethoprim (7.6%) and nitrofurantoin (5.4%).</s>
            <s>For fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, flucloxacillin and trimethoprim we found the highest yearly increase in switching.</s>
            <s>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was most often used as second antibiotic in a switch.</s>
            <s>A surprisingly high number of 2nd-and 3rd-choice antibiotics are prescribed as first antibiotic in a treatment.</s>
            <s>Conclusions: Although the actual reason for a switch is unknown, switch patterns can reveal problems concerning treatment failure and guideline adherence.</s>
            <s>In general, switch percentages of antibiotics in the Netherlands are low.</s>
            <s>The data contributes to the knowledge regarding antibiotic switch patterns in the outpatient setting.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The medical impact and economic burden of antibiotic resistance is tremendous and increasing annually <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Antibiotic resistance is a direct result of antibiotic (mis)use and therefore appropriate use of antibiotics is of utmost importance <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Approximately 80-90% of total human antibiotic consumption occurs in the outpatient setting <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Collecting data on outpatient antibiotic use is essential for adjusting practice to ensure appropriate use of antibiotics.</s>
          <s>Published reports concerning antimicrobial drug use and resistance offer insight in trends and, therefore, play a major role in policymaking <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A wide variety of indicators exist in literature to quantify and qualify antimicrobial use, without consensus on the most appropriate indicators to be used <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Overall, quality indicator analyses consider each antibiotic prescription as an individual course and do not take consecutive antibiotic use into account.</s>
          <s>Patients might need more than one prescription during an infectious disease episode.</s>
          <s>The treatment strategy can change, or be extended due to inadequate symptom resolution, results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests, allergies, adverse drug reactions, therapeutic noncompliance, or as a result of an initially wrong diagnosis.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To retrieve reliable results on consecutive antibiotic use, the index date of the antibiotic and the duration of the therapy have to be well documented and a unique patient identifier is needed.</s>
          <s>Therefore only databases containing high quality prescription or dispensing data are suitable for the analysis of consecutive antibiotic use in the outpatient setting.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>So far, only a few studies deal with consecutive antibiotic use <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These studies focus on specific indications <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> , individual antibiotics <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , or specific patient groups <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The main outcome in these studies is treatment failure, defined as a refill of the index antibiotic dispensed after the completed days of therapy (prolongation), a prescription of a different antibiotic within one month after the index prescription (switch), hospitalization, or a visit to the emergency department.</s>
          <s>It has been shown that the vast majority of treatment failures include antibiotic switches <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Besides calculating treatment failure for individual antibiotics, it is of great interest to visualize antibiotic switches and focus on second prescriptions within an antibiotic treatment.</s>
          <s>It is of importance whether 2nd/ 3rd choice antibiotics are prescribed as first one, which is often inappropriate, or as second one within an infectious disease episode, which could be appropriate for severe infections, or to treat pathogens resistant to the 1st choice antibiotic.</s>
          <s>Therefore, studies dealing with consecutive antibiotic use can provide valuable insight.</s>
          <s>We aimed at evaluating switch patterns in antibiotic use in the outpatient setting in the Netherlands.</s>

          <s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study giving an overview of all first and second prescriptions within antibiotic treatment episodes from a national database of outpatient antibiotic use.</s>
          <s>The vast majority of antibiotics, including antibiotics that are generally considered as second-or third-choice treatments, are prescribed as first antibiotic in a treatment.</s>

        <head>Comparison with literature</head>
        <p>
          <s>Previously conducted studies regarding consecutive antibiotic use report high treatment failure rates <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A study performed in the United States of America reports unadjusted failure rates ranging from 20 to 24% for antibiotics prescribed for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A study from the United Kingdom reports an overall treatment failure rate of 15% for antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and acute otitis media <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The vast majority of treatment failures include antibiotic switches as is demonstrated in the study of Currie et al. reporting a switch in 94% of failures <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A recent study from Norway reports an average switch rate of 6% for doxycycline, amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin and macrolides <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A Danish study evaluated prescribing patterns of antibiotics among Danish children and found switch percentages of 5 and 1% for phenoxymethylpenicillin and amoxicillin <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although we cannot directly compare our results with these data, due to different settings and studies, differences in switch rates between countries is apparent.</s>
          <s>Switch rates in the Netherlands seems to be low in comparison with US, UK and Norway.</s>
          <s>We found the highest switch percentages for trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin.</s>
          <s>These antibiotics are predominantly used to treat urinary tract infections and the switch percentages indicate that initial treatment with these antibiotics is quite often followed by another antibiotic.</s>
          <s>According to the Dutch national guidelines, nitrofurantoin is the first choice treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the outpatient setting <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Fosfomycin should be used as second choice and trimethoprim as third <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The total use of nitrofurantoin significantly increased from 1.0 defined daily dose (DDD) /1000 inhabitant-days to 1.4 DDD/1000 inhabitant-days <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , and the switch percentage for nitrofurantoin showed a minor yearly increase.</s>
          <s>Trimethoprim showed a relatively high switch percentage of 7.6%.</s>
          <s>This might be explained by high resistance to trimethoprim among urine-isolated E. coli, K. pneumonia and P. mirabilis, the predominant species causing urinary tract infections in the Netherlands <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was shown that fosfomycin, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are often used as second prescription after initial treatment with nitrofurantoin.</s>
          <s>This is in line with the Dutch guidelines for the treatment of urinary infections <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the vast majority of prescriptions for fosfomycin, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin concern first prescriptions in a treatment, which is not in line with guidelines.</s>
          <s>A decrease in the switch percentage for sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is in line with a decreasing resistance for this agent in the primary care setting in the Netherlands <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the Netherlands, presentation of urological indications has been increasing, with 148 episodes per 1000 patient-years in 2010; the prescribing rate for urological indications remained about 50% <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For ciprofloxacin we found a yearly increase in total use and a corresponding annual increase of 0.08% in its switch percentage.</s>
          <s>This is worrisome as it could reflect increased bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin.</s>
          <s>Ciprofloxacin often is a 3rd choice treatment in Dutch primary care and reserved for severe infections and hospitalised patients, and resistance in primary care jeopardises this aim.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Not surprisingly, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is the drug that is most often used as second antibiotic in a switch.</s>
          <s>It is used after a wide variety of first prescriptions, including nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin, doxycycline, flucloxacillin, a macrolide and ciprofloxacin.</s>
          <s>A second prescription of either azithromycin or clarithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or doxycycline after initial amoxicillin are all plausible changes in treatment strategy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our data indicate that fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin are increasingly used as second drug in an antibiotic treatment course.</s>
          <s>This could be the result of high switching from trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin and the increase in cystitis episodes <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Treatment failure due to resistance to first choice antibiotics could also be (partly) responsible for this observation, however, as we do not know the reason for a switch firm conclusions cannot be drawn.</s>
          <s>The increase in fosfomycin being used as a second agent might be the result of changes in the Dutch guidelines for urinary tract infections.</s>
          <s>Since 2005 fosfomycin is considered the second option to treat cystitis, making it plausible that fosfomycin use (as first and second prescriptions) increases in the following years.</s>

        <head>Strengths and limitations of the study</head>
        <p>
          <s>The main strength of the study is the use of a nationwide database containing over 90% of total dispensed antibiotics.</s>
          <s>The use of a database containing pharmacy dispensing data instead of prescription data results in more valid estimations of consumed antibiotics.</s>
          <s>Because patients in the Netherlands are often linked to one pharmacy, it is possible to monitor subsequent antibiotic use based on pharmacy data.</s>
          <s>A recent study showed that only 2% of patients regularly switch between pharmacies <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast to earlier antibiotic switch studies that report data on Left side: the top-9 initial antibiotics that are followed by a second prescription within an antibiotic treatment episode.</s>
          <s>Right side: the top-9 antibiotics that are used as second prescription in a switch.</s>
          <s>The group others on the left side of the figure reflects 10% of the total switches, mainly consisting of pheneticillin (36%), fosfomycin (21%) and cotrimoxazole (14%).</s>
          <s>The group others on the right side of the figure reflects 14% of second prescriptions in a switch.</s>
          <s>This group predominantly involves cotrimoxazole (24%), flucloxacillin (17%) clindamycin (16%) and norfloxacin (14%) specific diagnoses, or specific groups of antibiotics <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , our study gives an overview of the total outpatient antibiotic use.</s>
          <s>The greatest value of our approach is the analysis and visualisation of consecutive antibiotic use and distinguishing between prolongations and switches.</s>
          <s>In contrast to other studies that define switches as a prescription of a new antibiotic within 1 month after index date <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , our study uses a calculated end date of the first antibiotic to define antibiotic switches.</s>
          <s>The chance of including treatment for new or unrelated infections instead of prolonged treatment of the initial one is largely reduced by this method.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we excluded patients on (nearly) chronic antibiotics because these could distort the data.</s>
          <s>In these patients antibiotics are mainly used for the prevention of recurrent infections instead of treating acute infectious disease episodes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, there are also limitations to our study that need to be addressed.</s>
          <s>First, the indication for prescription was not available.</s>
          <s>With the indication it would have been possible to specifically identify those switches that deviate from national treatment guidelines.</s>
          <s>Second, the data only contains outpatient pharmacy data.</s>
          <s>Data on treatment failures leading to hospital admission, visits to the emergency department, or antibiotics previously used in the hospital setting were not available and could not be incorporated.</s>
          <s>Finally, we were not able to determine the actual reason for the antibiotic switches.</s>
          <s>Although we speculate that an antibiotic switch reflects ineffectiveness of the treatment, possibly as a result of bacterial resistance, there can be several other explanations.</s>
          <s>Switches can also be a result of doctors' behaviour (wrong diagnosis, inappropriate prescribing), patients' behaviour (non-compliance, inappropriate expectations and re-counselling), or progression of the infection itself (including complications), or availability of the results of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing.</s>
          <s>The evidence linking antibiotic treatment failure and antibiotic resistance is considered to be weak <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, we cannot expect that bacterial resistance is the major cause of treatment failure and antibiotic switches.</s>

        <head>Future challenges</head>
        <p>
          <s>The dataset could be enriched by linking pharmacy data with clinical patient data, the antibiotic indication, outcomes of antimicrobial susceptibility tests, clinical outcomes and complications.</s>
          <s>However, there are security, privacy and technical issues that need to be addressed before such linking can be performed.</s>
          <s>Another challenge is to study seasonal and demographic differences in switch percentages for antibiotics.</s>
          <s>For European comparison studies, we encourage others to also evaluate trends in consecutive antibiotic use and switching patterns.</s>
          <s>These issues can provide even more detailed information that can help policymaking.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The vast majority of antibiotics are prescribed as single courses, also antibiotics that are generally considered as 2nd-or 3rd-choice treatment.</s>
          <s>This is not in line with current guidelines.</s>
          <s>Switch percentages of antibiotics are low with an average percentage of 3%.</s>
          <s>The highest switch percentages were found for trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin.</s>
          <s>The most common antibiotic switches are in line with guideline recommendations.</s>
          <s>The data contributes to the knowledge regarding antibiotic switch patterns in the outpatient setting.</s>
