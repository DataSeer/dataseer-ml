          <head>The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in the prevalence and risk factors of cognitive impairment (CI) by analyzing and comparing two cross-sectional epidemiological surveys of CI and its</head>
          <p>
            <s>subtypes were performed in a rural area of northern China between 2010 and 2015.</s>
            <s>Residents aged ≥60 years were drawn in northern China.</s>
            <s>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is recommended to test for CI.</s>
            <s>Dementia was further categorised into Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and dementia caused by other diseases (ODs).</s>
            <s>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was classified into MCI caused by AD (MCI-A), MCI caused by VaD (MCI-VD), and MCI caused by ODs (MCI-O).</s>
            <s>The prevalence of CI increased in China.</s>
            <s>The prevalence of all-cause CI was 30·5% (22.9%</s>
            <s>MCI and 7.6% dementia) in 2010.</s>
            <s>The prevalence of all-cause CI was 38.3% (27.8%</s>
            <s>MCI and 10.5% dementia) in 2015.</s>
            <s>Similar increases were observed for the prevalence of subtypes of dementia and MCI.</s>
            <s>These findings suggest an increasing prevalence of CI and its subtypes in China, which may be related to alterations in sociodemographic factors, vascular risk factors and lifestyle changes over time in these cohorts.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Population aging changes lifestyle habits and public health problems.</s>
            <s>Chronic non-communicable diseases have become the leading cause of mortality in China.</s>
            <s>Dementia is one of these non-communicable diseases that is considered to have the greatest economic and social effects, particularly in rural regions 1,2 .</s>
            <s>The World Alzheimer Report 2010 3 predicted that dementia will have greater economic effect than that of cancer, heart disease, and stroke combined.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Assessing cognitive impairment (CI) is an important part of the diagnostic criteria for dementia.</s>
            <s>CI ranges from mild to severe, and is one of the most common and disabling non-motor symptoms among elderly individuals.</s>
            <s>The prevalence of severe CI (dementia) is reported to be approximately 4−8% in Western developed countries and 5−7% in China 4 .</s>
            <s>The number of people with dementia is likely to increase as the population ages 5 .</s>
            <s>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is also designated as cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), is used to describe syndromes in older adults that include a broad array of cognitive impairments.</s>
            <s>MCI represents an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia.</s>
            <s>Patients with MCI have a much higher risk of dementia.</s>
            <s>After an initial diagnosis of MCI, the incidence of dementia within 1, 5, and 9.5 years was 10-15, 60.5 and 100%, respectively 6 .</s>
            <s>Early identification of subjects at risk for MCI is a key interventional target for dementia, and adopting effective preventive strategies may delay or even prevent dementia.</s>
            <s>Therefore, MCI has received increased attention in recent decades.</s>
