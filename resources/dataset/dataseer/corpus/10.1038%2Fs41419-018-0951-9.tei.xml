          <s>Tooth development, like many other organs' formation, requires multi-lineage cells controlled by different signaling pathways.</s>
          <s>During tooth formation, a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells differentiates into odontoblasts, which are the columnar polarized cells located at the outer edges of dental pulp, expressing dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), and producing dentin.</s>
          <s>Ameloblasts are derived from dental epithelium and secrete enamel matrix, which is the hardest and highly mineralized tissue.</s>
          <s>Dental pulp is the soft tissue inside the tooth, and their function is to support dentin formation and regeneration <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> .</s>
          <s>Primary cilia are highly conserved microtubule-based solitary organelles that are present on almost all vertebrate cells.</s>
          <s>Formation and function of primary cilia require intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and other ciliary proteins <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> .</s>
          <s>Mutation of those proteins usually causes cilia defects, leading to a wide range of diseases called ciliopathies.</s>
          <s>These disorders target multiple tissues, of which bone and tooth are most common tissues <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>For example, Wnt1-Cre; Kif3a fl/fl mice (deletion of ciliary motor-Kif3a in dental mesenchyme) show impaired incisor and molar development <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>

          <s>Abnormal molar development was also found in Evc −/−11 and IFT88 orpk mice <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>

          <s>Previously, we reported that IFT80, one of the IFT complex B proteins, promotes osteogenesis <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> and deletion of IFT80 in osteoblast precursor cells leads to decreased bone mass with impaired osteoblast differentiation through regulating Hh signaling pathway <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>

          <s>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are growth factors that are important for bone and tooth development and regeneration <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>

          <s>Among FGFs, FGF2 is highly expressed in odontoblast lineage cells <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>

          <s>In this study, we generated IFT80 conditional knockout mouse by breeding IFT80-floxed mice with Osterix (OSX)-Cre transgenic mice and examined their phenotypic and molecular changes in tooth development.</s>

          <s>We observed that incisors were completely absent in 15-day-old OSX;IFT80 f/f mice, and severely underdeveloped and malocclusioned in 1-month-old and 3-month-old OSX;IFT80 f/f mice <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The average incisor eruption age was around postnatal day 7 in OSX;IFT80 +/+ mice, whereas it was delayed to postnatal day 14 for lower incisors and postnatal day 21 for upper incisors in OSX; IFT80 f/f mice.</s>
          <s>Mandibular incisors were isolated from their sockets for morphological analysis.</s>
          <s>OSX;IFT80 f/f incisors were obviously shorter but more curved at all examined time points <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref> .</s>

          <s>Examination of skulls by micro computed tomography showed the malocclusion and defects in both mandibular and maxillary incisors in OSX;IFT80 f/f mice <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These data suggest that IFT80 is critical for incisor development.</s>

          <s>Therefore, we performed Ki67 staining to detect cell proliferation.</s>
          <s>As we expected, the results showed that proliferating cells were control mice <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref> .</s>

          <s>We next examined molar development and found that molars were normally erupted in both OSX;IFT80 f/f and OSX;IFT80 +/+ mice.</s>
          <s>The crowns of molars were well formed but the roots were shorter in OSX;IFT80 f/f mice compared with those in OSX;IFT80 +/+ mice ( <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref> and <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. S1A and S1B</ref> ).</s>

          <s>Thus, the crown-to-root ratio was significantly increased in OSX; IFT80 f/f mice <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref> .</s>

          <s>A most recent study showed that IFT140, one of the IFT protein that formed IFT complex A, is highly expressed in odontoblasts and knockout of IFT40 leads to delayed and defective dentin formation due to poor odontogenic differentiation, abnormal primary cilia, and decreased Hh signaling <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this study, we used an IFT80 conditional knockout mouse model, which is one of the components of IFT complex B, and found the similar dental phenotypes-reduced odontoblast proliferation and shorter root formation.</s>
          <s>Deletion of IFT140 or IFT80 all causes defects in cilia formation, suggesting that primary cilia, instead of individual IFT protein, play an essential role in the odontoblast proliferation and differentiation.</s>
          <s>However, inconsistently, hypomorphic alleles of IFT88 (Tg737 orpk ) showed increased Hh signaling and formation of supernumerary molars in the diastema of both the lower and upper jaws, indicating that IFT protein likely also regulates cilia-independent pathway during tooth development.</s>
