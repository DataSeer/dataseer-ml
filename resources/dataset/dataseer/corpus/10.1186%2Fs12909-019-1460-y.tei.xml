            <s>This study aimed to understand how undergraduate medical and nursing students understand compassion towards people with dementia and factors influencing the delivery of compassionate care.</s>
            <s>Methods: Nine individual in-depth interviews and two focus groups were undertaken with 23 medical and nursing students.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Compassion is widely recognised as an essential component of good quality care, but despite it being a commonly used concept in healthcare, the construct of compassion is complex with multiple definitions <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent research has started to explore these definitions and how specific factors, situations, patient groups, and healthcare providers relate to compassion <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Etymologically, the Latin roots of the word 'compassion' include the verb 'patior' (to suffer) and the affix 'cum' (with) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In healthcare, compassion can be defined as 'a virtuous response that seeks to address the suffering and needs of a person through relational understanding and action' <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been suggested that such action 'can be as quick and as easy as a gentle look or a reassuring touch' <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a study where compassion in physician-patient dialogues was investigated through recordings, researchers identified three components: recognition, emotional resonance, and movement towards addressing suffering <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Healthcare professionals have been found to conceptualise compassion as 'acting with warmth and empathy, providing individualised patient care and acting in a way you would like others to act towards you' , <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> including 'perspective taking' , demonstrating empathy, and acting to alleviate suffering <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Compassion is rightly expected by patients, professional organisations, and healthcare providers <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>UK professional governing bodies such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council stipulate the need for compassion, care, and respect for patients <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> with healthcare providers expected to carry out their roles, not only with expertise and skill, but also with compassion.</s>
          <s>Conversely, a lack of compassionate care can lead to patient suffering and poor outcomes.</s>
          <s>This is well illustrated by the UK Francis Report which looked into care at the Mid-Staffordshire National Health Service (NHS) Trust <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It identified that high levels of patient suffering, mortality and morbidity were linked to a lack of compassionate care, and concluded that to improve patient outcomes, there was need for more patient-centred and compassionate care <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Compassion is of particular importance in the delivery of good quality care to people with dementia.</s>
          <s>Dementia is a major developing twenty-first century health and care priority.</s>
          <s>It is estimated there are 50 million people with dementia globally, costing US $1trillion <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These numbers and costs are set to increase threefold by 2050.</s>
          <s>The syndrome is characterised by progressive decline in cognitive function including communication abilities, and increasing activity limitation.</s>
          <s>Added to these are frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, agitation, aggression, and psychosis which may occur at any stage of the illness.</s>
          <s>Taken together, these clinical characteristics present a particular challenge for health and care services and those who provide them.</s>
          <s>Gold standard 'person-centred care' is underpinned by empathy towards the person with dementia and is reliant upon direct and meaningful engagement, with value being attributed, and the ability to view the world from their perspective <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the healthcare experiences of many people with dementia in the community and in hospital are often poor <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> with an over-reliance on task-oriented, as opposed to compassionate care <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Given the increasing prevalence of dementia and the high multimorbidity associated with the condition, future clinicians, regardless of specialty (other than obstetrics and paediatrics), will be caring for people with dementia <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> , and will need to deliver compassionate care.</s>
          <s>Early clinical experiences (positive or negative) and professional training can shape the career-long attitudes, empathy, and preferences of nursing and medical students to working with particular patient groups <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been suggested that tailored dementia education could be used as a method to enhance empathy and compassion towards people with dementia before attitudes become fixed <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how compassion and empathy towards people with dementia develop in healthcare professionals to inform the content of such educational programmes and many students have little contact with people with dementia <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We therefore designed this study to explore how undergraduate medical and nursing students, who had been exposed to contact with people with dementia as part of the Time for Dementia programme, define and understand compassion in their interactions with people with dementia and factors influencing the delivery of compassionate care.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Initial analysis included descriptive coding where two researchers (BB and SD) independently coded meaningful segments of text from three transcripts (two interviews and one focus group) to identify possible themes.</s>
          <s>The two researchers then met to review and discuss coding and agreed on an initial coding framework.</s>
          <s>The remaining transcripts were coded using constant comparison techniques, which included reviewing coding and data between existing and new transcripts <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This allowed identification of new codes, checking consistency in the use of codes, and exploration of the relationships between different codes.</s>
          <s>The findings from the initial coding were reviewed to identify the most pertinent themes.</s>
          <s>The two researchers met regularly to identify and discuss emerging themes, and a focussed coding framework was established.</s>
          <s>Additionally, as one of the researchers (BB) was a medical student, academic supervision was provided by an expereinced non-medical/nursing qualitative researcher.</s>
          <s>Reflexivity was supported by academic supervision and the use of a fieldwork diary by BB so that he could reflect on the impact of his role (as a medical student) on the research.</s>
          <s>Additionally, to reduce the risk of bias, BB was not directly involved in the interviews or focus group for medical students.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, a similar opportunity for the involvement of a nursing student did not exist.</s>
          <s>The analysis was supported by the use of Nvivo 11 (QSR International, 2010).</s>

        <head>Defining compassion</head>

          <s>While the three themes are reported separately, they were frequently discussed together.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Connection involved being able to understand and recognise the situation which the person with dementia was in, as well as demonstrating empathy by being able to put oneself in the patient's place and being able to communicate an understanding of their struggle.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>"Realising how frustrating it must be for them (the person with dementia) … not being able to remember a certain thing and it must be very, very frustrating."</s>
          <s>(Interview nine, nursing student).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the Caring theme the participants perceived that caring involved showing kindness, having the motivation to help the person with dementia, and taking actions that responded to suffering by acting to support patients.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>"Compassion is caring about a person but not just because you feel that you need to take care of that person, it's because, kind of, you want to help.</s>
          <s>It's very easy to see for example compassionate care and care without compassion.</s>
          <s>Care without compassion is more just let's do it because we have to do it or because we are here to do it or we are paid to do it.</s>
          <s>It's (compassionate care) more of a desire to help someone."</s>
          <s>(Interview one, nursing student).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Respect included recognising the person with dementia's humanity, maintaining their dignity, and treating them with honesty and patience.</s>
          <s>It also involved listening, demonstrating a non-judgmental approach, and recognising the person with dementia as separate to, and more than the presenting illness.</s>

          <s>(Interview seven, nursing student).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Some participants described feeling indifferent towards patients' concerns and seeing the only the disease not the person behind the disease.</s>
          <s>Again, this led to a lack of compassion and lack of action to respond to their distress.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Increased experience of people with dementia, whether in a personal or professional capacity was seen as facilitating compassion towards those with dementia.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study is the first to explore in-depth student compassion in the context of caring for people with dementia.</s>
          <s>The three student definitions of compassion (connection, care, and respect) and the three identified barriers/facilitators to compassion towards people with dementia (connection, patient factors, and student factors) are of potential help in assessing potential impacts of education and training on dementia care and in designing such programmes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As discussed above, compassion is a complex concept.</s>
          <s>Our findings revealed that healthcare students view compassion as connecting with a patient and understanding their situation, and that caring and kindness are key components of compassion, all of which are consistent with the wider literature on conditions other than dementia <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our finding that connection and student and patient factors influence compassion towards people with dementia is consistent with The Transactional Model of Physician Compassion which depicts facilitators and barriers to compassion as a function of clinician, patient and system factors <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In terms of student factors, we found that level of exposure through personal or professional experience of dementia can either facilitate or hinder compassion.</s>
          <s>One study exploring whether compassion could be taught to medical students found that personal experience could be a key contributor to compassion <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nursing research has suggested that previous experience of dementia can be helpful when caring for people affected by advanced dementia <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Personal experience of the illness, has also been found to help develop compassion <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This suggests that there is value in programmed time spent with people with dementia and their families as part of undergraduate healthcare education.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Having accurate knowledge about dementia was seen as facilitating compassion towards patients with dementia.</s>
          <s>Consistent with this, it has been found that a lack of knowledge and understanding about dementia can negatively impact care of dementia patients <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to having knowledge about dementia, clinical and communication skills were perceived to facilitate compassion.</s>
          <s>This is consistent with the wider literature on the delivery of care to people with dementia, where having these skills has been seen as enhancing compassionate care <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> , whereas lack of skill in these domains is recognised as adversely affecting care <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our study found that negative student emotions, and situational stress impeded compassion.</s>
          <s>This finding is similar to studies which found that a negative emotional state could reduce compassion <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> and empathy towards a person with dementia <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The busy nature of clinical work and lack of time has been shown to impact negatively on clinicians' emotional state therefore reducing compassion and quality of care <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our findings did not identify reflection as either a barrier or facilitator to empathy towards people with dementia.</s>
          <s>This is not in keeping with wider literature <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34]</ref> , for example, one study looking at student nurses suggested that self-reflective opportunities were an influencing factor of compassion <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Further, it has been suggested that enhanced compassion involves experiential and reflective learning from life and clinical experiences <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We also found no reference to role modelling which has been identified as an important method of enhancing compassion <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It may be that the integral reflection that is part of the curricula at the medical and the nursing school studied means that there was little variation in reflection so it was seen as normal practice.</s>
          <s>In terms of role modelling it may be that the powerful educative role that people with dementia and family carers take up in the Time for Dementia programme so that compassion and understanding are forefronted, again resulting in saturation and a consequent lack of variation in our sample.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study suggests that patient behaviour, when not understood as part of the illness, was a barrier to compassion.</s>
          <s>Staff may be reluctant to engage with aggressive patients <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35]</ref> and when people with dementia are aggressive or distressed this may cause negative impact on the care delivered <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These types of attitudes towards the behaviours of dementia patients are not uncommon <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Obtaining personal information on the person with dementia and clinical knowledge were seen as effective in addressing these negative perceptions and promoting compassion, enabling students to recognise the person behind the disease.</s>
          <s>This demonstrates the value of ensuring that students understand that the behaviour of people with dementia is not in their control but is part of the disease or a demonstration of unmet need <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, the findings from this study also show how, despite an understanding of compassion and increased dementia education, people with dementia may continue to be perceived negatively <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> , even in healthcare professionals in training, whose views are only beginning to be formed.</s>
          <s>This fits with Kitwood's theory of malignant social psychology whereby staff behaviour can undermine personhood and wellbeing in dementia <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In terms of addressing this, as noted above, knowing more about the patient and understanding the impact of the illness was a factor influencing compassion positively.</s>
          <s>This echoes nursing and palliative care research which has shown that seeing patients as unique individuals, is a key component of being compassionate <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Within an acute setting, it is recognised that this might be challenging, especially where communication is limited <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref> , .therefore this strengthens the need to actively engage with family members and use written tools such as personalised information booklets for patients with dementia, which provides information on care preferences, key relationships, in order to enable healthcare providers to connect with the people with dementia under their care.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Concerns have been raised about the limited time in undergraduate healthcare student curricula dedicated to developing skills in and understanding of dementia <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our data suggest that a more nuanced approach education and training in dementia may be required to enhance compassion towards people with dementia <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41]</ref> Further research is needed into how compassion and empathy develop over time in students at undergraduate level, how this differs between professional groups and how this changes as they move into practice and employment, in order to identify the most effective and timely educational interventions.</s>

        <p>
          <s>There are five main limitations to this study.</s>
          <s>First, this study was completed in a set of students who had participated in the Time for Dementia programme.</s>
          <s>This programme will have shaped their beliefs about dementia and compassion and different findings may have been generated from students receiving traditional healthcare education.</s>
          <s>However we chose this population since we were interested in their beliefs having had contact with people with dementia.</s>
          <s>In many courses it would have been possible that students would have had no direct experience of dementia.</s>
          <s>Second the sample included only nursing and medical students, therefore the findings cannot be generalised to other healthcare student groups such as allied health professionals or paramedics.</s>
          <s>Finally, the majority of the participants were between the ages of 18 to 25, therefore we did not hear perspectives from older students who may have had different perspectives of compassion in dementia care.</s>
          <s>Fourth, we have not specifically sought to explore the differences between medical and nursing students, and it may be that our results may have been influenced profession specific factors as such as the lack of a nursing researchers, focus of the topic guide and environment, this would need to be considered in future research.</s>
          <s>Finally, a medical student was part of the research team, but not a nursing student, this may have unintentionally introduced bias into the analysis, although this was partially address by the analysis being led by a researcher with an occupational therapy background (SD).</s>

          <s>This is the first study to investigate directly healthcare students' perspectives on compassion in dementia care, as such the novel data generated have the potential to inform education and further research.</s>
          <s>The study has focussed simultaneously on both medical and nursing views and as such takes a bottom up approach to deliver an interdisciplinary perspective which may well be particularly useful in dementia care which requires high levels of multidisciplinary cooperation.</s>
