        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Nanocarriers, like NEs, can be involved in combining two or more anticancer agents with different physical properties in order to assure their simultaneous delivery into the target cells and thereby a synergistic effect of the incorporated agents may develop.</s>
          <s>Compared to the IC 50 of IFO, the IC 50 's of the entire NE formulas were markedly reduced in both of MCF-7 and HeLa cells which can be attributed to the small sizes and negative zeta potentials of the NEs nanodroplets that facilitate their permeation into the cancer cells <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, the incorporation of the IFO and ESSOs, SAL and LEM oils, into the NEs may enhance their accumulation in the cancer cells and thereby potentiate their anticancer activity <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the produced nanoemulsions formulations in the present study have the narrowest average size as compared with the previous studies <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, the IC 50 's subjected to HeLa cells of the SAL-IFO and LEM-IFO was reduced three times relative to the formulation produced in previous work at self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>The response of the MCF-7 cells to the NE formulas has differed from the HeLa cells.</s>
          <s>In general, HeLa cells were more sensitive than the MCF-7 cells as the IC 50 's of the tested formulas subjected into the HeLa cells were less than the IC 50 s administered into the MCF-7 cells.</s>
          <s>The growth of the MCF-7 cells was greatly impeded when subjected into the LEM-IFO meanwhile SAL-IFO has the best inhibition effect on the growth of the HeLa cells.</s>
          <s>The great apoptotic effect of LEM-IFO on the MCF-7 cells may stem from the extracellular vesicle formation, seen under the light microscope, indicating that LEM-IFO has got attached into the cell membrane and induced apoptosis integrated with autophagocytosis <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, the light microscopy images revealed that the apoptotic effect of SAL-IFO on the HeLa cells has enlarged the cancer cells and damaged the nucleus without vesicle formation which implies that SAL-IFO has passed the cell membrane.</s>
          <s>Although both of LEM and SAL oils have antiproliferation activity, they have different mechanism of action in inducing cell apoptosis.</s>
          <s>LEM oil was found to impede the growth of the colon cancer cells through suppressing PI3K/Akt pathway that lead to the mitochondrial death <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, many research studies have reported the antiangiogenic activity of SAL oil that prevents the tumor growth and invasion in various types of cancers <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the analysis of the DAPI images, the growth of the MCF-7 cells was linearly decreased whereas the growth of the HeLa cells was exponentially decreased as the concentration of the subjected NE increased.</s>
          <s>This inverse relation between the growth of the cells and the NE concentration was first-order reaction which means that the inhibition process relies on one component.</s>
          <s>In other words, the nanodroplets of the NE formulas did not get degraded in the cancer cell and may act as a one metabolite.</s>
          <s>In addition, the inhibition of the LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO has reduced the growth of the MCF-7 and HeLa cells with similar trends when compared to the LEM-NE and SAL-NE.</s>
          <s>This implies that there has been a synergistic effect caused by the incorporation of the IFO into the ESSOs-based NE <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the free IFO applied into either MCF-7 or HeLa cells has caused a parabolic decrease in the growth of the cancer cells as its concentration increase indicating that the inhibition process is a second order reaction which depends on two metabolites.</s>
          <s>In fact, IFO may get degraded in the cell and form the two active metabolites, IFO mustard and choroacetaldehyde, that may induce apoptosis in the cancer cells <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Incorporating the IFO into the ESSOs-based NE has markedly improved its cytotoxicity in the HeLa and MCF-7 cells.</s>
          <s>HeLa cells were more sensitive to the tested formulas than the MCF-7 cells.</s>
          <s>Among the NE formulas, LEM-IFO has the best apoptotic and inhibition effect on the MCF-7 cells while SAL-IFO has the best cytotoxic effect on the HeLa cells.</s>
          <s>Further studies have to be performed on the mechanism of apoptosis of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO.</s>
