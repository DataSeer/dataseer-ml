        <head>Results and Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Following concepts outlined in earlier works <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> , stable nanodroplets are formed in a two-step emulsification process through the synergistic action of hydrophilic nanoparticles and an oil-soluble zwitterionic surfactant.</s>
          <s>We illustrate this process using phosphatidylcholine (PC) and silica nanoparticles as zwitterionic surfactant and hydrophilic nanoparticles, respectively <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The zwitterionic surfactant effectively stabilizes micron-sized droplets of corn oil suspended in water during a first emulsification step.</s>
          <s>In a second emulsification step, the nanoparticles are introduced in the continuous aqueous phase of the primary-formed emulsions and the resulting mixture is subjected to ultrasonication.</s>
          <s>The high energy introduced through sonication lead to further break-up of the oil phase, decreasing the droplet size to the nanoscale.</s>
          <s>During this process, excess PC molecules present in the oil phase are expected to adsorb rapidly at the oil-water interface, reducing its interfacial tension and facilitating droplet break-up.</s>
          <s>This approach circumvents the slow diffusion rates and adsorption dynamics of particles at liquid interfaces <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29</ref> , thus enabling the stabilization of smaller droplet sizes.</s>
          <s>Observations of the emulsion microstructure by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) show that the silica nanoparticles adsorb as a dense layer around the oil nanodroplets <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Such dense layer exhibits a viscoelastic behavior that prevents coarsening and coalescence of the nanodroplets for long time periods, as evidenced by interfacial rheology measurements of the oil-water interface <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. S1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because the primary-formed droplets carry predominantly negative electric charges at the processing pH, electrostatic forces alone are not enough to explain the adsorption of negatively-charged nanoparticles to the droplet surface.</s>
          <s>Instead, adsorption may result from non-electrostatic forces and other interactions possibly involving the positive charges of the zwitterionic surfactant present at the oil-water interface <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. S1b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>By contrast, no viscoelastic film is formed when only particles or PC are used in the formulation, which results in larger and less stable droplets after emulsification <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. S2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>As demonstrated in previous studies <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref>
            <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> , the interfacial adsorption of particles is an effective mechanism to stabilize emulsions against coalescence and Ostwald ripening.</s>
          <s>Indeed, dynamic light scattering experiments show that the interfacial viscoelastic film enables the stabilization of nano-sized droplets for time periods as long as 3 months <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Nanodroplets formed through this processing route are stable enough to be concentrated by ultracentrifugation and thus form a dense jammed template that can be directly converted into a nanoporous structure upon drying or sintering <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2a)</ref> depending on the oil volatility.</s>
          <s>The porosity of the structure is controlled by the concentration of oil droplets in the jammed nanoemulsion, which was estimated to be higher than 70 vol%.</s>
          <s>To show that our processing route is applicable to a wide range of materials, we fabricated nanoporous structures using nanoparticles of distinct surface chemistries <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2b,c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to bare silica, alumina-coated silica nanoparticles were used as model building blocks for this purpose.</s>
          <s>By using coated particles, we demonstrate the versatility of the method while keeping the same particle size as the reference silica powder.</s>
          <s>The versatility arises from the zwitterionic nature of the surfactant, which is able to electrostatically attract both positively and negatively-charged hydrophilic particles during the second emulsification process <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. S1a)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Bare silica (Ludox TM50) and alumina-coated silica particles (Ludox CL-P) show indeed negative and positive net surface charges, respectively, at the processing pH of 5.5.</s>
          <s>This was confirmed by zeta potential measurements of such nanoparticles in water as a function of pH <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Using PC as zwitterionic surfactant, stable nanoemulsions were also successfully prepared using the alumina-coated silica nanoparticles.</s>
          <s>Sintering of the centrifuged emulsions led to porous structures with either bare silica or alumina-coated silica nanoparticles as the main building blocks in the pore walls <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Alternatively to sintering, chemical strategies can also be utilized to consolidate the structure if temperature-sensitive constituents need to be preserved, as discussed later <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>To confirm the flexibility of the method, porous structures were also successfully produced using smaller 7 nm silica particles and bare alumina particles as building blocks <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. S3)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The size of the nanopores obtained after drying and sintering directly reflects the size of the precursor nanodroplet templates.</s>
          <s>Taking the system with bare silica nanoparticles as an example, we observe that nanoemulsions with droplet size in the range of 150-1000 nm <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. S2</ref> ) lead to porous structures with pore sizes varying from 100 to 900 nm after drying and sintering.</s>
          <s>Because the nanoparticles form a dense layer on the surface of the precursor droplets, closed nanopores are often obtained after drying and sintering.</s>
          <s>However, open pores can also form if the emulsions are slightly destabilized during processing to generate droplet surfaces that are only partially covered by particles.</s>
          <s>For the emulsions investigated in this work, we found that such slight destabilization is possible by replacing corn oil by decane as the dispersed phase <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. S4)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The ability to tune the process to generate either open or close porosity after sintering enables tailoring of the porous structure according to the properties required by the aimed application.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition to nanoporous structures, the nanoemulsions can also be combined with micron-sized sacrificial templates to generate porous architectures featuring a second level of porosity.</s>
          <s>Two exemplary types of sacrificial templates are used here to create micron-sized pores: oil droplets and polymer particles.</s>
          <s>The choice of the second sacrificial template affects the possible consolidation step and the resulting porous structures.</s>
          <s>If micron-sized oil droplets are used, the wet emulsion template can be conveniently consolidated by simple evaporation of the liquid phases followed by chemical cross-linking of the remaining constituents.</s>
          <s>By contrast, polymer particle templates require a sintering step for consolidation if long dissolution of the solid polymer phase is to be avoided.</s>
          <s>Besides such distinct processing pathways, oil droplets are more prone to deformation and distortion during the drying and consolidation steps.</s>
          <s>This contrasts with the undeformable nature of polymer particle templates.</s>
        </p>
        <p>

          <s>In contrast to the size fidelity observed at small scales, the size distribution of larger pores was found to be broader as compared to the size distribution of the templating droplets.</s>
          <s>Such an effect is probably a result of the shrinkage that takes place during drying and the associated capillary forces that develop within the structure during removal of the liquid phases.</s>
          <s>Despite their small sizes, the nanopores generated on the walls of macropores <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref> were sufficient to generate an open porosity level as high as 90% in the final sintered structure.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Hierarchical porous materials can be fabricated by extrusion-based 3D printing of inks loaded with sacrificial pore templates at the nanometric and micrometric scales.</s>
          <s>Pore templates may consist of combinations of Pickering nanoemulsions, droplet assemblies and micron-sized polymer particles.</s>
          <s>The 3D printing process is simple and fast, since the nano-and microporosity are generated from the self-assembly of templating droplets and particles within the ink, as opposed to the slow sequential deposition of material required in other technologies.</s>
          <s>Because they are susceptible to coalescence during ink preparation, the templating droplets need to be stabilized by particles that will later form the walls of the pores created upon drying and consolidation.</s>
          <s>The zwitterionic nature of the surfactant used to promote this stabilization mechanism allows for the use of particles with a variety of distinct chemistries.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the dried printed structure can be consolidated either chemically or via heat treatment, depending on the ink formulation.</s>
          <s>Combined with the complex shaping capabilities of 3D printing, these features make the process highly tunable and open several new possibilities for the design and digital fabrication of hierarchical porous materials for a variety of applications.</s>
