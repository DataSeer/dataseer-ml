            <s>The unrestricted control of circularly polarized (CP) terahertz (THz) waves is important in science and applications, but conventional THz devices suffer from issues of bulky size and low efficiency.</s>

          <s>The manipulation of circularly polarized (CP) terahertz (THz) waves in a predesigned manner is highly desired due to both curiosities in fundamental physics and pressing technological demands in applications.</s>
          <s>For example, as many biomolecules exhibit chiral structures with rotational/vibrational modes in the THz regime, they interact distinctly with CP THz beams depending on their handedness.</s>
          <s>Thus, using specific CP beams (such as Bessel beams (BBs)) to control the motions of such biomolecules is very promising in many applications, such as drug delivery and biological sensing <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, handedness multiplexing can be a useful approach to increase the information processing capability of THz telecommunications.</s>
          <s>However, conventional THz devices (i.e., waveplates <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> , lenses <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> , and axicons 5 ) typically suffer from issues of bulky size and/or low efficiency due to the weak interactions between THz waves and naturally existing materials <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> , which only exhibit electric responses.</s>
          <s>Metasurfaces, ultrathin metamaterials that consist of planar subwavelength units (e.g., meta-atoms) with tailored electromagnetic (EM) responses, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in controlling EM waves <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>

          <s>THz metadevices with such high performances have rarely been observed in the literature.</s>

          <s>To design such a meta-atom, our previous analyses <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31</ref> revealed that a singlelayer resonator exhibiting only electric responses can never fulfill Eq. (2).</s>
          <s>We must search for meta-atoms simultaneously exhibiting electric and magnetic responses (see inset to <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref> ) with appropriate strengths for two different polarizations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These considerations motivated us to design our metaatom based on a freestanding anisotropic ABA structure <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>

          <s>The interlayer couplings can create appropriate effective magnetic currents inside the structure, whereas the "U" shape provides enough freedom to generate lateral anisotropy in the EM responses.</s>
          <s>With careful structural tuning, we obtained the final design for our meta-atom and then fabricated a sample containing a periodic array (periodicity of 128 μm) of the designed meta-atoms by standard photolithography.</s>

          <s>In contrast to previous microwave design studies where metals have been considered as perfect electric conductors, here in designing our THz meta-atoms, material losses should be seriously considered in the optimization process.</s>
          <s>The additional geometrical freedom provided by the "U"-shaped resonator offers enough room to fine tune the responses of the whole device, yielding an optimized performance in terms of working bandwidth and efficiency (see Figs S1-S6 in Supplementary Information).</s>

          <s>Obviously, the designed meta-atom exhibits high transmission amplitudes but with a π phase difference for the two incident polarizations at a frequency interval centered at 0.6 THz (the shaded region in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref> , e).</s>
          <s>Note here that the peak transmission amplitudes cannot reach 100% due to material absorption.</s>
          <s>Simultaneously, the reflections from the meta-atom are significantly suppressed in the same frequency interval (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S7</ref> in Supplementary Information), which together with <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref> , e already imply that our designed meta-atom has high efficiency in the working frequency band.</s>

          <s>In addition to verifying the measurements, the FDTD simulations also reveal the physical mechanism responsible for the high performance of the designed meta-atom.</s>
          <s>Indeed, substantial magnetic currents are induced in the ABA structure (see Sec. 1 in Supplementary Information), which are crucial to yield high transmission of EM waves (and thus a high polarization conversion efficiency).</s>
          <s>In addition, the FDTD simulations reveal that material losses (especially metallic losses) are responsible for the nonideal performance of our PB meta-atom (see Figs. S8-S10 in Supplementary Information).</s>
          <s>With such a high-performance PB metaatom, we can use it as a building block to realize many functional PB devices, with two examples presented in the following two subsections.</s>

          <s>Therefore, to design a PSHE metasurface, one simply arranges the orientation angle ϕ(x) of the meta-atom located at position x to linearly depend on x (i.e., ϕ(x) = ϕ 0 + ξ·x/2) so that the phase profiles of the anomalous transmission components exhibit opposite phase gradients depending on the input spin: Φ σ (x) = Φ 0 + σξ·x.</s>
