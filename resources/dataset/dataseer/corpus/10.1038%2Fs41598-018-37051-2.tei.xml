            <s>Deposition of 1.0-ML Bi on the In/Si(111)-(4 × 1) surface at room temperature results in Bi-terminated BiIn-(4 × 3) structures, which are stable up to ~300 °C annealing.</s>
            <s>By contrast, deposition of In on the β-Bi/Si(111)-(√3 × √3) surface at room temperature results in three dimensional (3D) In islands.</s>
            <s>In both cases, annealing at 460 °C results in the same In-terminated In 0.75 Bi/Si(111)-(2 × 2) surface.</s>
            <s>Our DFT calculations confirm that the surface energy of In-terminated In 0.75 Bi/Si(111)-(2 × 2) system is lower than that of Bi-terminated Bi 0.75 In/Si(111)-(2 × 2).</s>

            <s>Two dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) have attracted much interest in the last decade for their fascinating fundamental physics and possible applications in spintronic and quantum computing devices due to much reduced elastic electron scattering 1-4 .</s>
            <s>2D TIs, also known as quantum spin hall insulators, are atomically thin layered materials that exhibit time-symmetry-protected metallic edge states with an insulating interior 5,6 .</s>
            <s>Compared to the surface states in the 3D TIs, the edge states in 2D TIs are more robust since the only available backscattering channel is forbidden.</s>
            <s>In search of new and robust 2D TIs with large band gaps, many possible material systems have been experimentally and theoretically surveyed, including the binary combinations of group III (B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl) and group V (N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) elements in the buckled honeycomb structure 7 .</s>

            <s>The (5 × 5) and (√7 × √7) structures are proposed to be one-atomic-layer thick systems, in which the Bi and In atoms reside nearly on the same plane above the bulk-truncated Si(111) substrate.</s>
            <s>The (2 × 2) structure is modelled to be a Bi-terminated two-atom-layer system with three Bi atoms per (2 × 2) unit cell forming trimer in the top layer and four In atoms in the bottom layer on bulk Si(111).</s>
