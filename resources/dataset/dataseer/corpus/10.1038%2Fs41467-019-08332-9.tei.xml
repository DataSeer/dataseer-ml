          <s>Upon activation with α-CD3 and α-CD46, CD4 + Th1 cells undergo a self-regulatory cycle during which IFNγ + cells coexpress IL-10, followed by an IL-10 single-positive regulatory phase, creating a Th1 switching cycle <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>To unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of IL-10 during Th1 switching, we stimulated human peripheral blood CD4 + T cells with α-CD3 and α-CD46 for 36 h to generate cells at different phases of the Th1 switching cycle, as previously described <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>Double-negative IFNγ − IL-10 − , single-positive IFNγ + IL-10 − and IFNγ -IL-10 + cells and double-positive IFNγ + IL-10 + subsets were purified by cell sorting and subjected to gene expression profiling ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 1a</ref> and b).</s>
          <s>Initial clustering analysis revealed that populations did not segregate based on their gene expression ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>We reasoned that genes involved in the regulation of IL-10 expression would be present in the pre-IL-10 expression phases of the cycle (IFNγ − IL-10 − , IFNγ + IL-10 − subsets, black gates, <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref> ) and that their expression might correlate with IL-10 protein levels in the double-positive population (blue gate, <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>To test this, datasets were interrogated for genes present in either the double-negative or IFNγ + IL-10 − subsets whose expression correlated with IL-10 expression in the double-positive population.</s>
          <s cert="0.9880203604698181" id="dataset-1" type="Flow cytometry">Levels of IL-10 protein were quantified by flow cytometry using median fluorescence intensity (MFI) as an indicator of the number of IL-10 molecules per cell, and normalised to the MFI value of the double-negative population to account for inter-experimental variability.</s>
          <s>Using this approach we identified 111 genes expressed in both the double-negative and single-positive IFNγ + IL-10 − populations correlating inversely (top) or directly (bottom) with IL-10 levels ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref> and Supplementary Data 1).</s>
          <s>From these gene sets, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) ranked multiple pathways linked to cholesterol biosynthesis as being the most significantly associated with IL-10 expression <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>IPA analysis also revealed an inverse relationship between genes belonging to the CBP expressed by the pre-IL-10 populations and IL-10 protein levels in the doublepositive IFNγ + IL-10 + population, suggesting that active cholesterol biosynthesis might be required to license Th1 cells to express IL-10.</s>

          <s>To further investigate the link between cholesterol biosynthesis and IL-10 expression, we compared the transcriptome of Jurkat T cells stably expressing CYT-1 or CYT-2; the transcriptome of untransduced Jurkat T cells was used as control.</s>
          <s>Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three distinct subpopulations <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Supplementary Figure 1e)</ref> , indicating that signalling through either CYT-1 or CYT-2 tails was sufficient to drive distinct transcriptional profiles.</s>
          <s>Once again, IPA of differentially expressed genes identified cholesterol biosynthesis and related biosynthetic pathways (mevalonate and geranyldiphosphate) as highly enriched <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, and as observed in Th1 switching primary CD4 + T cells, these genes were downregulated in Jurkat T cells expressing CYT-1 (effector) when compared to CYT-2 (regulatory)-expressing cells.</s>
          <s>Together, these results indicate that Th1 switching to IL-10 expression is directly linked to the CBP, and that populations expressing IL-10 have higher levels of CBP-related genes when compared to IL-10negative populations.</s>

          <s>Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway blocks Th1 switching.</s>
          <s>To functionally assess the relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and the generation of IL-10-expressing T cells, we blocked cholesterol biosynthesis during Th1 switching by treating cell cultures with atorvastatin, a synthetic lipid-lowering statin that competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, one of the first steps of the mevalonate pathway (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Atorvastatin inhibited the generation of both IL-10expressing double-positive (IFNγ + IL-10 + ) and single-positive (IFNγ − IL-10 + ) cells in a dose-dependent manner, while the frequency of IFNγ + IL-10 − cells was increased <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2a</ref> Statins have previously been reported to alter Th effector cell responses 32,33 , so we next determined the effect of atorvastatin on the expression profile of IL-17 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in Th1 switching cells.</s>
          <s>While the results showed a decrease in the frequency of IL-17 + IL-10 + and TNFα + IL-10 + cells with atorvastatin treatment, we documented a concomitant increase in IL-17 and TNFα single-positive populations that did not express IL-10 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref> and Supplementary <ref target="#fig_7" type="figure">Figure 4g</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Once again these effects were reversed by MA supplementation.</s>
          <s>During analysis of the effects of statin on Th2 cytokine profiles, we were unable to reliably detect intracellular IL-4 by flow cytometry.</s>

          <s>Like IL-10, levels of IL-4 were also decreased in the presence of atorvastatin <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3f)</ref> , indicating that the effects of CBP perturbation are not confined to IL-10 expression, but may also influence Th2 responses, while at the same time sparing or even potentiating Th1 and Th17 effector cytokines.</s>

          <s>To unravel the specific branch of the CBP that regulates IL-10 expression, we cultured Th1 switching cells in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors that target enzymes in the cholesterol pathway (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref> and analysed IL-10 expression.</s>

          <s>None of these compounds exerted statin-like inhibitory effects on either the frequency of IL-10 + cells ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> ) or its secretion (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">Figure 5a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In keeping with these findings, supplementation of atorvastatin-treated cells with increasing concentrations of the metabolites farnesyl-PP or geranylgeranyl-PP failed to rescue the frequency of IL-10 + cells to those levels observed with MA supplementation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3c)</ref> , a finding also confirmed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Supplementary <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">Figure 5b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the inhibitory effects of short-term atorvastatin exposure do not appear to be related to perturbations of the isoprenylation pathway.</s>

Inhibition of IL-10 levels in statin-treated cultures was prevented by supplementation with mevalonic acid (MA), confirming the specificity of this effect, and arguing against off-target effects of the pharmacological inhibitor. Measurement of IL-10 secretion after 36 h of culture produced similar results(Fig. 2c). It is noteworthy that atorvastatin had only a modest effect on the MFI of IL-10 in residual populations of IL-10-expressing cells (Supplementary Figure 4a), suggesting again that statins primarily block the transition from IFNγ to IL-10-producing cells, rather than</figDesc>
