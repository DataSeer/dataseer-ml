            <s>In this study, paired-end Illumina HiSeq TM technology has been employed to generate transcriptome data from eye and ventral skin tissues of the lanternshark.</s>
            <s>About 64 and 49 million Illumina reads were generated from skin and eye tissues respectively.</s>
            <s>The assembly allowed us to predict 119,749 total unigenes including 94,569 for the skin transcriptome and 94,365 for the eye transcriptome while 74,753 were commonly found in both transcriptomes.</s>
            <s>A taxonomy filtering was applied to extract a reference transcriptome containing 104,390 unigenes among which 38,836 showed significant similarities to known sequences in NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database.</s>
            <s>Around 58% of the annotated unigenes match with predicted genes from the Elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome.</s>
            <s>The transcriptome completeness has been evaluated by successfully capturing around 98% of orthologous genes of the « Core eukaryotic gene dataset » within the E. spinax reference transcriptome.</s>
            <s>We identified potential "light-interacting toolkit" genes including multiple genes related to ocular and extraocular light perception processes such as opsins, phototransduction actors or crystallins.</s>
            <s>Comparative gene expression analysis reveals eye-specific expression of opsins, ciliary phototransduction actors, crystallins and vertebrate retinoid pathway actors.</s>
            <s>In particular, mRNAs from a single rhodopsin gene and its potentially associated peropsin were detected in the eye transcriptome, only, confirming a monochromatic vision of the lanternshark.</s>
            <s>Encephalopsin mRNAs were mainly detected in the ventral skin transcriptome.</s>
            <s>In parallel, immunolocalization of the encephalopsin within the ventral skin of the shark suggests a functional relation with the photophores, i.e. epidermal light-producing organs.</s>

            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The development of a sophisticated battery of sensory systems is considered as an important factor explaining the evolutionary success of the elasmobranchs and their relatives <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Sharks have been considered as "swimming noses" because of their high olfactory abilities.</s>
          <s>Their large telencephalon, i.e. the forebrain, is indeed primarily dedicated to olfaction <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Other sensory systems-including light perception-have received traditionally much less attention <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Early studies reported that the retina of the majority of cartilaginous fishes contains only rod photoreceptors <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These organisms were thought to have poor visual acuity with eyes that are specialized for scotopic vision (i.e., dim light condition) with no capacity for photopic vision (i.e., bright light condition) or color discrimination <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Rods indeed serve scotopic vision and are highly sensitive, at the expense of visual acuity.</s>
          <s>Other specializations include (i) the presence of a tapetum at the rear of the eye for reflecting light back on to the photoreceptors and (ii) a high photoreceptor to ganglion cell summation ratio that increases sensitivity at the expense of acuity <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>More recently, it was demonstrated that the majority of cartilaginous fishes are able to function under a range of photopic and scotopic light intensities and actually possess a duplex retina containing both rod and cone photoreceptors <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>

          <s>Cones are used for photopic and color vision and are responsible for higher visual acuity.</s>
          <s>Some deep-sea sharks and rajids appear to have all-rod retinas <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>Photoreceptors contain visual pigments made up of membrane proteins, the so-called opsins, linked to a chromophore prosthetic group, which changes its conformation when exposed to light, inducing a cascade that finally transmits the visual information to the brain <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The opsin chromophore is a vitamin A-based retinaldehyde, either the retinal (A1) or the 3,4-dehydroretinal (A2) in fish <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Most shark species, mainly epipelagic, possess A1-associated opsins sensitive to blue green light (historically called "rhodopsins" while this term is now used as a generic term to describe all visual pigments).</s>
          <s>Most deep-water sharks also have A1-associated opsins sensitive to deep blue light (historically called chrysopsins) while some freshwater species have A2-associated opsins that have a red shift in their absorbance maxima (historically called porphyropsins) <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>

            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The diffuse photosensitivity over the whole or parts of the animal's skin was described as the "dermal light sense" but even deeper tissues of the body, such as neural or brain cells, can be photosensitive <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Like the visual photopigments, non-visual photopigments may consist of an opsin protein linked to a retinal chromophore.</s>

          <s>In the context of the opsin-based perception of light, the characterization of the E. spinax eye transcriptome revealed the presence of the unique visual opsin (Es-rhodopsin) most probably functionally coupled with a peropsin (Es-peropsin).</s>

          <s>Immunodetections of the encephalopsin showed a widespread expression within the cell membrane of the shark epidermal cells surrounding the photophore while no expression was seen in the photocytes themselves.</s>
          <s>Where darkness is permanent, bioluminescence constitutes the main source of light and these sharks are no exception to the rule.</s>
          <s>These mid-water cartilaginous fishes indeed emit a ventral light to efficiently mask their silhouette from downwelling ambient light and remain hidden from predators and preys <ref target="#b93" type="bibr">[94]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The encephalopsin expression in the surrounding area of the photophore supports the hypothesis of a potential interaction between light emission and reception.</s>

A. photosensitive film of immunoblotting performed on the protein extract of E. spinax ventral and dorsal skin as well as retina with an antibodies directed against extraocular opsin: anti-encephalopsin PAb from Genetex, GTX 70609, lot number 821 400 929, 1/2000. 50 μg of total protein were used in each well. B. Cryosection immunofluorescence directed against extraocular opsins in different tissues of the lanternshark, E. spinax. Visualization of a photophore paraffin section (A). Visualization of the labelling on cryosections of a ventral skin section with photophores (B), a section of the retina (C). The B and C sections were given the primary antibody GTX (primary antibody: anti-encephalopsin PAb from Genetex, GTX 70609, lot number 821 400 929, 1/50). The secondary antibody was coupled with a red fluorochrome (Alexa Fluor 594 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Antibody, highly cross-adsorbed (A-11037), 1/300 from Life Technologies Limited).
