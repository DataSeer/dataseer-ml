            <s>Scholarly studies and common accounts of national politics enjoy pointing out the resilience of ideological divides among populations.</s>
            <s>Building on the image of political cleavages and geographic polarization, the regionalization of politics has become a truism across Northern democracies.</s>
            <s>Left unquestioned, this geography plays a central role in shaping electoral and referendum campaigns.</s>
            <s>In Europe and North America, observers identify recurring patterns dividing local populations during national votes.</s>
            <s>While much research describes those patterns in relation to ethnicity, religious affiliation, historic legacy and party affiliation, current approaches in political research lack the capacity to measure their evolution over time or other vote subsets.</s>
            <s>This article introduces "Dyadic Agreement Modeling" (DyAM), a transdisciplinary method to assess the evolution of geographic cleavages in vote outcomes by implementing a metric of agreement/disagreement through Network Analysis.</s>
            <s>Unlike existing approaches, DyAM offers a stable measure for political agreement and disagreementaccounting for chance, statistically robust and remaining structurally independent from the number of entries and missing data.</s>
            <s>The method opens up to a range of statistical, structural and visual tools specific to Network Analysis and its usage across disciplines.</s>
            <s>In order to illustrate DyAM, I use more than 680,000 municipal outcomes from Swiss federal popular votes and assess the evolution of political cleavages across local populations since 1981.</s>
            <s>Results suggest that political congruence between Swiss local populations increased in the last forty years, while regional political factions and linguistic alignments have lost their salience to new divides.</s>
            <s>I discuss how choices about input parameters and data subsets nuance findings, and consider confounding factors that may influence conclusions over the dynamic equilibrium of national politics and the strengthening effect of globalization on democratic institutions.</s>

          <s>In their pivotal work on conflicts and their translation from and into party systems, Lipset and Rokkan <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> show that divergent attitudes between culturally dominant and subjected populations, workers in primary and secondary economic activities, and supporters of established and subversive values generate more or less salient divides between voters.</s>
          <s>The overlap of cleavages and the spatial cluster of voters produces local and regional contrasts in partisan supports, macroscopic patterns in vote outcomes and a geographic institutionalization of conflicts <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Developing experimental approaches to shed light on political behaviors, Enos establishes empirical evidence on the effect of segregation <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> , interaction <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> and ground campaigning <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> on vote outcomes.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The Swiss direct democratic system provides reliable material to analyze political cleavages within the national population.</s>
          <s>Very frequent votes on a wide array of topics and publicly accessible data make Switzerland a perfect "laboratory" for the study of mass political behaviors <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Looking at vote outcomes of local and regional populations, researchers have examined where dominant political cleavages appear in the country using multivariate analysis techniques <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref>
            <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[53]</ref>
            <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[54]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For example, Diskin and colleagues <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">[54]</ref> analyze cantonal outcomes of 537 federal popular votes called between 1866 and 2005 and find that collective political behaviors across cantons become more and more similar with time.</s>
          <s>In discussing their results, the researchers suggest that popular votes at the national level have themselves contributed to the ideological alignment of regional populations.</s>
          <s>In a similar fashion, Hermann and Leuthold <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">[56]</ref> recode local outcomes of federal popular votes to reveal three dimensions that structure the Swiss political landscape: liberal/conservative, left/right and ecological/technocratic.</s>
          <s>They then combine their factor analysis to experimental cartographic methods and highlight the role of geographic characteristics on the political behavior of local communities.</s>
          <s>In this research, they show the dividing effect of language, the clustering effect of urbanization and the disruptive effect of local social contexts onto the political dimensions of Swiss popular votes <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In order to identify such structuring dimensions in the data, both teams of researchers rely on multivariate analyses to maximize the variance of correlated variables and generate uncorrelated vectors, or N-dimensions that describe the data <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">[58]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While this approach may provide insightful observations, it has several important limitations for the study of political cleavages and polarization.</s>
          <s>Every transformation is self-referential, which means that the projection of populations onto dimensions is relative to the value space of input data.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the operation does not accept missing values in input variables, and dropping a single entry greatly affects output vectors.</s>
          <s>It is therefore impossible to meaningfully measure the ideological distance between populations or compare data subsets such as sectional periods, political themes or types of vote.</s>
          <s>In order to overcome these limitations, Dyadic Agreement Modeling (DyAM), which I present in this article, adds to the recent redevelopment of Network Analysis in political research.</s>

        <head n="2.3">Exploring political cleavages with Network Analysis</head>
        <p>
          <s>The relational nature of power makes Network Analysis an ideal approach to study political dynamics <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[59]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Over the last fifteen years, new computational methods in network research provide means to answer pressing and important questions in the study of political behaviors, democratic institutions, policies and international relations.</s>
          <s>Against the "methodological individualism" that prevails in political and sociological research, networks hold a unique capacity to model complex systems.</s>
          <s>More than a mere method, networks analysis results from a new paradigm that posits and explores political phenomena as resulting from relationships between agents <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[60]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In network research, those agents are called nodes, and the relationships that tie them together are called edges.</s>
          <s>Hence, by looking at the organization of those nodes and edges, many attributes of networks translate directly or indirectly into parameters and characteristics of "real-world" political organizations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Among the most common of those parameters, density describes the degree of connectivity between nodes of the network.</s>
          <s>Mathematically, it is defined as the ratio of edges in a network divided by all possible edges that could exist between its nodes.</s>
          <s>In order to express the unequal distribution of density across the network, modularity measures how it is fragmented into communities.</s>
          <s>High modularity means a network has dense connections between certain nodes but sparse connections between groups of connected nodes.</s>
          <s>In certain networks, another important parameter is their degree of transitivity.</s>
          <s>Also called "clustering coefficient," the global measure of transitivity corresponds to the number of closed triplets divided by the number of closed or open triplets in the network, where triplets are three nodes connected by either three (closed) or two (open) edges.</s>
          <s>Transitivity is an important characteristic of real systems, either social or natural.</s>
          <s>Together with modularity, transitivity shows agents connect with other agents through shared relationships, rather than randomly.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The community structure of the network represents the primary characteristic of real systems <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[61]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In such networks, communities (or modules) consist in groups of nodes that have more edges between each other and comparatively fewer edges joining nodes in other groups.</s>
          <s>The presence of communities within a network can be detected by measuring its modularity.</s>
          <s>Evidently, defining limits or overlaps between communities is of great importance for empirical research <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[62]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary body of scientists working on the detection of community structures, the problem has no satisfactory solution.</s>
          <s>Instead, different techniques are used in relation to parameters and attributes of the networks, and offer different advantages and disadvantages to the detection of communities <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[63]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A common application of community detection techniques in the study of political dynamics looks at the groups and divides that animate legislative processes <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[64]</ref>
            <ref target="#b64" type="bibr">[65]</ref>
            <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[66]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this literature, researchers look at the sponsorship and co-sponsorship of bills by individual parliament members using roll-call data.</s>
          <s>Such application of Network Analysis to political research offers means to understand power relationship as non-hierarchical systems, and how those systems can adapt to changes in partisan support <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although marginal, the application of Network Analysis to voters' behaviors <ref target="#b66" type="bibr">[67,</ref>
            <ref target="#b67" type="bibr">68]</ref> demonstrates how democratic decision-making is tied to contexts and interdependence between voters.</s>
          <s>Those works explore the "micro-macro" divide in politics, thus reiterating a longstanding claim of political geographers on the importance of considering the political relationship between places, groups and individuals, what Agnew <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> calls the "spatial situatedness of human action in contrast to the non-spatial sorting of people out into categories based on census and other classification schemes that inspires most conventional social science."</s>

          <s>Federal popular votes concern all aspects of legislation attributed to the federal parliament: political functioning, foreign policy, security policy, economy, public finance, infrastructure, planning and the environment, social policy, as well as education, culture and communication.</s>

          <s>Votes are largely discussed in the media, and the government, major parties and ad hoc support and opposition groups advertise their positions to the public during the months that precede voting day.</s>
          <s>From a legal point of view there are three types of votes objects: Obligatory referenda by which the population is required to accept or reject a modification to the federal Constitution proposed by the Parliament; facultative referenda, which take place when the population petitions the Government against the enactment or the amendment of a law; and popular initiatives that can be called for when a certain share of the population requests a modification to the Constitution.</s>

            <ref target="#b77" type="bibr">78]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This finding is, however, put into perspective when examined against more recent outcomes; agreement networks that include votes called in the 2000s and 2010s point to a new layout of political cleavages between local populations.</s>
          <s>Metrics from those networks show a constant increase in political agreement between local populations and linguistic groups.</s>
          <s>This supports findings I make from graph visualizations on the nationwide convergence of municipal vote outcomes.</s>

          <s>In the second part of the results, I show another use of DyAM, which consists of the cartographic transposition of the networks.</s>
          <s>Keeping with a combination of visual heuristic and network metrics, I map out the political communities detected in networks on population maps of Switzerland.</s>
          <s>I then fine-tune the colorimetric rendering of the population clusters to afford a sharper reading of the geographic evolution of political cleavages.</s>
          <s>This second step facilitates a linkage of the relationship that ties changes in the political divides of local populations to their geographic and demographic characteristics.</s>
          <s>Here the results speak for themselves.</s>
          <s>Once transposed to maps, network communities underpin a recent alignment between physically distant populations, and support the idea of a topological organization of the Swiss political space.</s>
          <s>In keeping with recent observations, cartograms illustrate how global connectivity has become a dominant source of political differentiation between local populations.</s>

          <s>In the last part of the results, I reintroduce (negative) disagreement values in DyAM by illustrating the use of egocentric networks with the municipal populations of Geneva, Zurich and Unteriberg.</s>
          <s>For each of these examples, I consider agreement and disagreement values obtained with all other local populations over four sectional periods.</s>
          <s>I then visualize those values with choropleth maps of Swiss municipal boundaries.</s>
          <s>This additional implementation of the method allows me to address the political transformation of 2,275 local populations as specific case studies.</s>
          <s>While each of the three examples I report tells a different story, agreement and disagreement values confirm overall tendencies I describe in the previous parts of the section.</s>
          <s>Among other findings, I note the increasing agreement between voters residing in large cities, their political alignment with linguistic minorities, and the resilient divide between those populations and German-speaking communities in suburban and remote areas.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Overall, the results support the accuracy and utility of DyAM to study the evolution of geographic cleavages between local populations.</s>
          <s>Many of the macroscopic patterns I find concur with previous research on Swiss political cleavages.</s>
          <s>Others match observations that have been hinted at but not empirically demonstrated.</s>
          <s>In comparison with other approaches, DyAM offers a stable, resilient and precise method to assess political congruence between local populations.</s>
          <s>Moreover, its fixed measure of agreement/disagreement provides a timely and necessary technique to address polarization as a dynamic phenomenon.</s>
          <s>The Alpha's intrinsic control for agreement/disagreement by chance, its acceptance of missing values and its statistical robustness make it an ideal metric of political congruence.</s>
          <s>On a conceptual level, the Alpha stands closer to the idea of political agreement/disagreement than other metrics.</s>
          <s>Its implementation into networks allows for a direct and coherent interpretation of multiple network parameters.</s>

          <s>Results illustrate how political congruence operates according to two types of relationships between local populations.</s>

          <s>The second logic offers a complimentary linkage for distant places.</s>

          <s>Over the past five years, the political alignment of local populations has articulated a two-fold geographical logic.</s>
          <s>On the one hand, agreement over federal votes points at the importance of localities' degree of urbanization, splitting German-speaking communities in three clusters: urban, suburban and periurban.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, French-speaking, Italian-speaking and Romansh-speaking populations expressed strong consensus with each other and with German-speaking urban centers.</s>
          <s>Cultural divides such as language, which have been believed to be decisive in political processes, are becoming less important than other forms of cultural characteristics such as proximity to urban centers or global connectivity.</s>
          <s>This latter characteristic is revealed by the higher agreement between certain remote villages and larger cities.</s>

          <s>These results concur largely with previous findings and assumptions on the dynamics of Swiss political cleavages.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Additional research would also be necessary to solidify these findings.</s>
          <s>For example, changes in the themes of votes could make some cleavages more salient.</s>
          <s>Popular initiatives have mostly been backed by Left parties in the past, but are increasingly used by Right parties nowadays.</s>
          <s>Likewise, changes in partisan support or party politics may affect the geographic evolution of political cleavages.</s>
          <s>These confounding factors help nuance results of DyAM, but could eventually also be addressed through the method itself.</s>
          <s>Unlike multivariate approaches, DyAM allows researchers to compare measures of political congruence between local populations.</s>
          <s>This is also true for other subsets of the data.</s>
          <s>DyAM could therefore be used to explore whether the themes of the votes are responsible for increasing or decreasing political cleavages between given populations, how party support influences polarization, or if votes should be weighted.</s>
          <s>Further analyses on the specific application of the Alpha would reinforce the research.</s>
          <s>In this article, I use binary vote outcomes to measure political congruence between local populations.</s>
          <s>I find that this data reduces measured Alpha values by 20% when compared with vote outcomes expressed as ratios.</s>
          <s>A paired samples t-test confirms that the difference is consistent for every dyad in the network.</s>
          <s>While this does not affect outcomes of this article, variations across levels of measurement would need to be addressed in order to identify strict thresholds of political congruence.</s>

        <p>
          <s>As reported in this article, the DyAM tackles two acute methodological limitations in political research.</s>
          <s>The first consists in the measure of political disagreement between local populations.</s>
          <s>Here, the Alpha's intrinsic control for agreement by chance offers such possibility.</s>
          <s>The second limitation concerns the difficulty in comparing the geographic organization of political communities across time.</s>
          <s>Contrary to existing approaches, DyAM makes such comparisons possible.</s>
          <s>As such, the method succeeds in addressing political polarization as a dynamic process, rather than a static state <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This capacity to "measure" the depth of political cleavages across time and space is, to my knowledge, unique to DyAM, and offers a substantive contribution to electoral geography and political science.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The implementation of the Alpha trough Network Analysis offers additional tools and metrics.</s>

          <s>Throughout its development, DyAM should largely contribute to answering pressing and important questions in political research.</s>
          <s>The transdisciplinary nature of network approaches shall also permit findings made with DyAM to connect outside of the disciplinary context in which they are produced.</s>
          <s>For example, the "geographyblind" patterns that result from DyAM also confront a fundamental assumption of geography: the idea of regionalization as the logic that governs space.</s>
          <s>In the following part, I wish to discuss how a relational approach to political behavior, which focuses on populations' similarity, nuances the idea that nearer things are more related.</s>
          <s>Two figures offer the right material to do so: the topological evolution of political communities over four sectional periods in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig 5</ref> and the evolution of that Swiss political landscape from the point of view of Zurich in <ref target="#fig_7" type="figure">Fig 7.</ref> Space is a complex dimension of society.</s>
          <s>Addressing such complexity to better understand humans as individuals and as groups, geographers model space on an empirical as well as a conceptual level.</s>
          <s>In a diagrammatic definition, Lévy speaks of space as set of distance relationships between different social realities.</s>
          <s>To him, each space holds at least three attributes: a substance, which defines the type of distance considered; a scale, which defines the range of the distance; and a metric, which defines how the distance is measured.</s>
          <s>Spaces result from the combination of those attributes.</s>
          <s>For example, contiguous regions are a specific case of spatial configurations: a space in which Euclidean metrics are used to describe both its internal relationships and its limits <ref target="#b92" type="bibr">[93]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Such definition applies to most patterns I find in the first two sectional periods illustrated in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig 5:</ref> we see most political communities during the '80s and '90s organize into regions that tie contiguous local populations divided mostly by linguistic frontiers.</s>
          <s>Yet, we also see few political communities that span "across space" and comprise distant or at least non-contiguous populations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This second type of spatial configuration becomes more obvious in the periods that follow.</s>
          <s>After 2001, political communities are practically free from linguistic regionalization.</s>
          <s>For example, one community connects major cities together with most French-, Italian-and Romansh-speaking populations, despite these populations being "not near" one another.</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="bibr">Fig 7</ref> illustrates how the population of Zurich is more similar to those in larger cities, French-speaking municipalities and the Grisons, than with denizens of nearer areas of the canton.</s>
          <s>While both types of spatial configuration exist within each political community, the latter topological format does seem to become a dominant mode of organization in the Swiss political landscape, substituting itself to the former topographical layout.</s>
          <s>Of course, such considerations do not contradict Tobler's "first law of geography" altogether <ref target="#b85" type="bibr">[86]</ref> , but warn us about what "closer" and "related" may mean in terms of spatial relationships.</s>
          <s>While the idea behind DyAM is mostly inherited from a long-standing tradition in human geography that focuses on relations to identify geographic spaces that are relevant but hard to grasp intuitively, many aspects of the method and its applications shall be refined in subsequent analyses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The patterns I detect with DyAM suggest that contemporary political cleavages in Switzerland relate more to the global connectivity of local populations than to so-called "urban-rural" or "center-periphery" oppositions.</s>
          <s>From the findings, I propose a new typology to explain political divides.</s>
          <s>I call "extrovert" clusters where local populations have interacted with foreigners for a long time.</s>
          <s>"Introvert," in opposition, are clusters where local populations have had fewer direct interactions with otherness.</s>
          <s>In between, "selective" populations live closer to "extrovert" locations, but foreigners are unlikely to be found in their neighborhoods.</s>
          <s>In Switzerland, this model explains why distant populations may repeatedly produce similar outcomes over federal votes.</s>
          <s>It matches the "anomalies" I detect with the method, as well as the convergence of major cities with linguistic minorities, and the clustering of German-speaking populations across suburbs and remote areas.</s>
          <s>Moreover, such patterns resemble those observed in recent elections and referendums across Northern countries.</s>
          <s>With this framework, I wish to anchor the study of mass political polarization in the daily and multidimensional dynamics of human interactions and exchanges, and the complexity of relational space.</s>
          <s>I believe that DyAM offers a step towards such theoretical considerations.</s>
          <s>In the following, I wish to discuss three issues that need to be addressed with DyAM in order further pursue this research agenda.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The first issue concerns the difficulty to interpret measures of agreement/disagreement.</s>
          <s>This article attempts to measure political agreement/disagreement between local populations over multiple votes.</s>
          <s>To do so, I use a singular set of data, municipal outcomes over Swiss federal participatory votes.</s>
          <s>Direct democracy in Switzerland represents a singular political institution with very few possible cases to compare <ref target="#b93" type="bibr">[94]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While more or less frequent usage of popular votes occur in certain places, such as California or Italy, the Swiss direct democratic system holds a unique importance within the daily life of Swiss people.</s>
          <s>Krippendorff's Alpha is a measure of reliability designed to check how coders agree or disagree over content.</s>
          <s>The formula is primarily used in Content Analysis with few applications in other methodological contexts.</s>
          <s>As shown in the present study, the Alpha finds many practical and conceptual compatibility with vote outcomes and the study of political cleavages.</s>
          <s>Yet, the lack of reference work makes it difficult to give context the measures of agreement/disagreement.</s>
          <s>Further research could therefore focus on comparing agreement/disagreement over dominant political themes or juridical type of votes.</s>
          <s>Likewise, outcomes should be contrasted with those for participatory votes in California.</s>
          <s>Looking at agreement/disagreement over a series of elections could also prove valuable, especially in opening the method to other case studies, despite the infrequent occurrence and general complexity of such democratic decision-making process.</s>
          <s>From a methodological point of view, the full potential application of the Alpha to political congruence remains to be tested, and should therefore be compared to other metrics.</s>
          <s>Instead of computing agreement/disagreement from binary vote outcomes, further research should attempt to similar work using continuous or ranked values, and see how they affect results.</s>
          <s>Similarly, because of the Alpha's capacity to measure agreement/disagreement for any number of populations, it could be used for groups with more than two sets of voters to depict contrast within states or regions.</s>
          <s>DyAM could then be used across levels to assess political agreement/ disagreement between individual voters, local populations, party members, political groups and organizations, thus offering a methodological solution to the investigation of micromacro relationships in political dynamics.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Such exploitation of DyAM to generate ecological measurements points a second issue, which concerns the analysis of collective political behavior using aggregated data for vote results.</s>
          <s>In the present study, I use results of federal participatory votes to identify regional and inter-regional political divides and alignments between localities.</s>
          <s>For each vote object, the data concerns the number of cast ballots and the proportion of ballots in support.</s>
          <s>Results I present can only illustrate the collective behavior of active voters, thus accounting for a large share of municipal residents.</s>
          <s>Yet, Swiss municipalities-communes-present very heterogeneous territorial and demographic characteristics.</s>
          <s>They vary greatly in terms of land area, landscape, usage, industry, job market, infrastructure, population size, religious affiliation, language, age and ethnic composition.</s>
          <s>Some cities house up to forty percent non-national residents, while border regions have strong daily influx of cross-border workers.</s>
          <s>Switzerland's repute for beautiful landscapes, winter activities and historical architecture attracts millions of tourists each year.</s>
          <s>The country's larger cities and alpine regions have become international hubs for affluent visitors and diplomats.</s>
          <s>Secondary houses are common in those areas for either recreational or work-related purposes, and Swiss people spend much of their time outside the municipality where they have registered their main residence <ref target="#b94" type="bibr">[95]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Likewise, agreement/disagreement measures that I report rather illustrate local contexts rather than individual political attitudes, for it is unlikely that voters remain the same from one vote to the next, especially over a 34-year period.</s>
          <s>All those conditions-those of a "real world"-limit the possibility to offer non-schematic interpretation of large geographic patterns built from binary collective vote outcomes.</s>
          <s>Yet, the coherence between the results, the demographics of Swiss local populations and the country's political dynamics suggest the method is able to model this relationship at a sufficient degree of precision to produce meaningful empirical knowledge.</s>
          <s>DyAM thus offers a precious contribution to the geographic study of political cleavages across local populations.</s>
          <s>In a "data-driven world," such a timely contribution helps reconsider common assumptions about the regionalization of political behaviors.</s>
          <s>The increase importance of Big Data, and the ensuing necessity to anonymize individuals from multilayered datasets could surely benefit from this method and its eventual development for even smaller levels of aggregation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, another set of issues with the method concerns characteristics of the techniques I combine.</s>
          <s>An important contribution of the Alpha holds to its capacity to account for disagreement as a distinct measure from low agreement.</s>
          <s>Because an agreement/disagreement by chance coincides with α = 0, I keep the metrics' value space from -1 to 0 for disagreement and from 0 to +1 for agreement.</s>
          <s>While negative values are common in real-life social network, their usage in Network Analysis remains difficult.</s>
          <s>This, because many community detection algorithms and network visualization algorithms cannot handle negative values.</s>
          <s>In the present study, I use both types of algorithms, which limits my use of negative Alpha values.</s>
          <s>To overcome this limitation, I avoid the use of algorithmic calculations by mapping out "egocentric networks," which portray political agreement/disagreement for each sectional period from the perspective of selected case studies.</s>
          <s>Hence, the study I present here offers a departure point to a new departure for the geographical analysis of political cleavages, not its conclusion.</s>
          <s>In that sense, DyAM offers to measure political disagreement but-like for positive values in the Alpha-still lacks of necessary empirical evidences to qualify what "disagreement" means in terms of measured Alpha values.</s>
          <s>In this article, I mostly rely on traditional visualization techniques I borrow from Network Analysis and cartography in order to interpret outcomes of DyAM.</s>
          <s>As in any visualization, I adjust the parameters in order to offer the greatest readability for the data.</s>
          <s>Although I have little control over the spatialization algorithms used to visualize networks into graphs, I am able to adjust the orientation, the transparency and the coloring of edges and nodes to provide more coherent illustrations.</s>
          <s>For example, in order to coherently color code the communities detected in each graph, I use a color wheel.</s>
          <s>For each network, I carefully choose the position and the orientation of the color wheel so that communities' colors match across different sectional periods.</s>
          <s>For the lack of a better technique, I thus color-code political communities in order to avoid the use of random colors, which would lessen the readability of graphs and cartograms.</s>
          <s>Similarly, I use "differentiated cartograms" because they provide a more pertinent metric of space-that of municipalities' populations size-while also making it easy to navigate the map for someone familiar with the geography of Switzerland.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These issues illustrate the challenges of transdisciplinary analyses.</s>
          <s>As such, DyAM contributes to a growing body of research on the definition of spatial boundaries stemmig from social connectedness <ref target="#b84" type="bibr">[85,</ref>
            <ref target="#b95" type="bibr">96]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In a like manner to the study I present, this work outlines social processes as inherently spatial, define spatial boundaries in terms of social relationships, and ground their method in network analysis.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This study provides new methodological grounds to measure the evolution of political cleavages at a macroscopic level and test hypotheses on the polarization of voters.</s>
          <s>A geographic analysis of municipal outcomes over Swiss federal participatory votes called between 1981 and 2015 points to the political convergence of local populations; the de-regionalization of political polarization; the alignment the voting majority living in larger cities with those from national linguistic minority regions; the erosion of the long-standing "linguistic divide"; and the resilience of new alignments and divides between local populations in larger cities, suburbs, remote areas, cosmopolitan villages and minority cultural regions.</s>
          <s>Behind those findings, the method of Dyadic Agreement Modeling, which I present in this article, highlights the dynamic nature of political polarization.</s>
          <s>Results illustrate the emergence of strong topological spatial relationships over political matters, matching an intuitive understanding of current social dynamics as increasingly built upon material and immaterial networks.</s>
          <s>The methodological as well as empirical contributions I make here should prove useful to policy-makers, political strategists together with spatial planners, and contribute to renewing an interest for the ecological analysis of political behavior and polarization.</s>

        <figDesc>W denote the agreement/disagreement matrix, where the component W ij 2 [−1, 1] is the degree of agreement/disagreement that the voting municipal population i has with one other municipal voting population j. This corresponds to an undirected weighted complete graph with municipal voting populations represented as nodes and agreement/disagreement values as edges between nodes. Agreement W ij over binary outcomes between the voting majorities of two municipal populations is measured with the Alpha. From W, I derive W 0 , an agreement matrix, where the component W 0 2 [0, 1] masks the value space above the definite value of agreement by chance. This second matrix corresponds to an undirected weighted graph in which edges correspond to (positive) agreement values between voting populations.</figDesc>
