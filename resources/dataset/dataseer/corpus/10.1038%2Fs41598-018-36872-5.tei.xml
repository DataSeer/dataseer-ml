            <s>Mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) semiconductor lasers are being widely developed for chemical sensing and biomedical applications 1-5 .</s>
            <s>The main benefit of these devices is the ability to rapidly identify specific chemicals based on characteristic absorption features.</s>
            <s>The ideal laser for this type of application is compact, widely tunable, has a scalable power output, and is inexpensive to produce.</s>

          <p>
            <s>Monolithic edge-emitting quantum cascade laser (QCL) technology, which relies on cleaved facets for laser operation, has demonstrated wide tuning and high output power from a single aperture 6,7 .</s>
            <s>Sampled grating distributed feedback (SGDFB) technology 8,9 provides non-mechanical tuning, and an integrated optical amplifier provides a high power option.</s>
            <s>However, testing and packaging of these devices require a labor intensive process which involves cleaving of individual laser cavities, mirror facet coating, and bonding of individual dies.</s>
            <s>As such, the economy of scale, though better than external cavity solutions, is still limited.</s>
            <s>A worthwhile goal is to develop wafer-scale fabrication to minimize die handling and greatly simplify pre-package screening, which in turn will minimize the cost to manufacture.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>One method is to utilize a surface emitting laser architecture, which does not rely on wafer cleaving to operate.</s>
            <s>A commercially successful demonstration of this method in the near-infrared is the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), which can be produced in large quantities and 2-D arrays for high power illuminators 10 .</s>
            <s>Additional benefits of a surface-emitting laser include higher yield packaging and more uniform heat removal, as the edge quality is not critical and the device can be placed in the center, as opposed to the edge, of a heat spreader.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Unfortunately, due to polarization selection rules in the QCL, the traditional VCSEL architecture cannot be utilized.</s>
            <s>Grating-based outcouplers are another alternative, and have been demonstrated for the QCL 11 .</s>
            <s>Unfortunately, the device performance is very sensitive to the operating wavelength.</s>
            <s>Nevertheless, this architecture allows for the incorporation of laser and detector on the same chip and in the same beam path, which makes for a compact, easy-to-align, chemical sensor 12 .</s>
            <s>This is also highlighted in a recent publication, where a tunable laser and grating outcoupler were integrated to realize surface emission with monolithic beam steering 13 .</s>
            <s>In this case, the main focus was on the steering component, which was designed to eliminate massive optomechanical assemblies in directed energy applications.</s>
            <s>The grating outcoupler is not the preferred choice, however, if a stable output beam and tunable wavelength are both desired.</s>
          </p>
          <p>

          <s>A lens shape is formed in the photoresist mask by thermal reflow (See Methods).</s>
          <s>Plasma etching is then used to transfer the photoresist shape into the semiconductor crystal with a controlled selectivity.</s>
          <s>In addition to controlling the shape of the etch sidewall, the photoresist reflow technique also helps remove mask micro-roughness, which creates a smoother edge profile.</s>

        <p>
          <s>An example of an etched rectangular feature is shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref> .</s>
          <s>Smooth sidewalls are demonstrated, with no preference for crystal orientation.</s>
          <s>Cross-section analysis of the etched feature used gives a laser core angle of ~53 degrees with respect to the wafer surface.</s>
          <s>The outcoupler angle was reproduced within measurement accuracy (~1 degree) in two separate fabrication runs.</s>
          <s>Uniformity of etch angle is found to be limited only by the uniformity of the photoresist thickness, as long as thermal contact is uniform across the wafer during plasma etching.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Once the angled feature is formed, a double channel laser waveguide can then be defined with a separate plasma etching process.</s>
          <s>This process forms a vertical-walled waveguide which intersects with the angled sidewall, forming a reflective outcoupler termination, as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> .</s>
          <s>No significant roughness (low rugosity) is observed on the outcoupler feature, which is significantly smoother than the vertical waveguide sidewall.</s>

          <s>The reflective outcoupler feature was formed (to a depth of 10 μm) by means of mask shape transfer prior to waveguide definition, as described in the Methods section.</s>

          <s>Similar to the demonstration in ref. <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> , the SGDFB design is capable of single mode emission and electrical tuning over a 90 cm −1 (215 nm) spectral range.</s>

          <s>Output power increases linearly over the tested range.</s>
          <s>From the slope of the output power data, it is observed that the amplifier power conversion efficiency is 14%.</s>
          <s>Some degradation of the SMSR is observed at higher currents, but it remains above 15 dB at the highest power output.</s>
          <s>This initial demonstration of the reflective outcoupler was made in pulsed operation using a wafer that was optimized for high peak power operation (see Methods).</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>While the device architecture does not allow for a straightforward direct comparison to an edge emitting laser, we can estimate the outcoupling efficiency of the reflective outcoupler.</s>
          <s>The main losses that arise with the reflective outcoupler geometry are scattering at the outcoupler and free carrier absorption in the substrate.</s>
          <s>Due to the extremely smooth outcoupler sidewall, which is shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> , the actual scattering loss is not expected to be significant.</s>
          <s>If present, it would lead to a large diffusive and/or speckled background in the far field, which is not observed On the other hand, the free carrier losses in the substrate do play a role in the power outcoupling efficiency.</s>
          <s>The substrate doping (1.4 × 10 17 cm −3 ) leads to an estimated free carrier absorption of 6.6 cm −1 at λ = 4.9 μm.</s>
          <s>For a 200 μm thick substrate, this leads to an outcoupling efficiency of 87.6%.</s>
          <s>This thickness was chosen simply to minimize the chance of breakage during fabrication.</s>
          <s>Reducing the substrate thickness to 100 μm would increase the outcoupling efficiency to 93.6%.</s>
          <s>Another possibility is to switch to a semi-insulating substrate, which would require another top contact, but reduce the losses.</s>
          <s>A third option is to incorporate a partial via above the outcoupler in order to extract the light closer to the waveguide.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Beyond this demonstration, the mask transfer technology can also be developed for other applications.</s>
          <s>One aspect to be explored is the fact that the reflector angle is adjustable, and can be shaped dynamically during etching.</s>
          <s>Besides straight facets, there is an opportunity to create a more parabolic profile with a single etch process, which can be used to increase or decrease the beam divergence at the output of the waveguide <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another opportunity that can be explored is the manufacture of refractive lenses directly on the wafer substrate <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this case, the lens would occupy the same area as the substrate emission window, with a radius of curvature adjusted to directly collimate the laser output.</s>
          <s>In conclusion, a cost-effective technology for wavelength-independent surface emission from a quantum cascade laser has been developed.</s>
          <s>A reflective outcoupler is fabricated via a mask transfer process in a standard plasma etching system.</s>
          <s>This outcoupler is integrated with an amplified, electrically tunable laser architecture to demonstrate high power surface emission at a wavelength near 4.9 μm.</s>
          <s>Single mode peak power up to 6.7 W is demonstrated with &gt;6 W available over a 90 cm −1 (215 nm) spectral range.</s>
