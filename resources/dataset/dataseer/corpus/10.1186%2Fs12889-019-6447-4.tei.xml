        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>There are an estimated 1.8 million adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, of which 82% live in sub-Saharan Africa <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This number is likely to increase due to improved survival of adolescents on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the increasing number of new HIV infections among young people <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent global efforts have re-focused attention on this age group, resulting in adolescent-focused guidance and implementation of HIV testing, treatment and care for adolescents <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Zimbabwe, like other countries in the region, has scaled up initiatives to promote case finding, earlier diagnosis and ART initiation, resulting in an estimated 80% of ALHIV now on ART <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite this success of ART for adolescents, AIDS-related deaths among this age group are not declining and remain among the leading causes of death for this age group in sub-Saharan Africa <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is increasing evidence that suggests that ALHIV have poorer outcomes than children and adults across the HIV care cascade, including poorer retention in care, lower rates of virological suppression and higher rates of mortality <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, studies have indicated that ALHIV have an increased risk of poor mental health outcomes such as depression <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> , which is itself associated with poor adherence <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recognising these challenges for ALHIV, the 2016 WHO consolidated ART guidance now recommends that community-based interventions which support ART adherence and retention in care should also integrate psychosocial support and engage peers in service delivery <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several examples of group based interventions exist for ALHIV and there is some evidence that these have contributed to improved retention, psychosocial well-being and virological suppression <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there is a critical need for further evidence of the effectiveness of peer-led community services for ALHIV, particularly for those living in rural settings as most literature to date has focused on urban settings.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The Zvandiri programme is a model of differentiated service delivery for children, adolescents and young people, between the ages of 0 and 24 years, in Zimbabwe <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Adolescents and young people living with HIV between the ages of 18 and 24 years are trained and mentored by Africaid and the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) as peer counsellors.</s>
          <s>These peer counsellors are known as Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters (CATS).</s>
          <s>After training, the CATS deliver adherence and psychosocial support in their own communities -in health facilities and the homes of other HIV positive children, adolescents and young people.</s>
          <s>Some programmatic data from Harare, Zimbabwe, suggest that engagement with a CATS improves linkage to services, retention care, adherence and psychosocial well-being and retention in care among young people living with HIV.</s>
          <s>No previous studies have been conducted on this topic in rural Zimbabwe.</s>
          <s>However, there is an urgent need for more empirical evidence of the effectiveness of this approach, in order to inform further programme development, national and international policy, guidelines and service delivery for ALHIV.</s>

          <s>Our findings showed that adolescents receiving CATS services had improved linkage to services, retention in care, self-reported adherence and psychosocial well-being compared to adolescents who did not have access to CATS services.</s>

          <s>Engagement with health care services ensures that adolescents with HIV are provided the medical care they need, treatments including ART, information, skills and support.</s>

          <s>The goal of these services is to improve the health and well-being of individual adolescents.</s>
          <s>Yet, adolescents with HIV have been found to have poorer retention in care compared with adults <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is likely due to a variety of individual, social and system related issues.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>Data from this study suggest that adolescents living with HIV receiving the CATS service have improved linkage and retention in care, improved adherence and improved psychosocial well-being, compared with adolescents who do not have access to CATS service.</s>
          <s>Importantly, unexpected outcomes also emerged from the study, including improvements in disclosure rates from caregivers to their children and strong support for the use of pill boxes and adolescent-friendly counselling tools.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, CATS were accepted and valued by caregivers and health workers.</s>
          <s>This evidence has been utilised to inform the scale-up of CATS services within the district, as well as other districts across Zimbabwe with the support of the Ministry of Health and Child Care.</s>
          <s>Further research is now needed to establish the effectiveness of the CATS service on a larger scale and on viral suppression to provide additional evidence around the effectiveness of this model.</s>
