          <p>
            <s>Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a neglected zoonosis caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, remains a public health issue in many developing countries that practice extensive sheep breeding.</s>
            <s>Control of CE is difficult and requires a community-based integrated approach.</s>
            <s>We assessed the communities' knowledge and perception of CE, its animal hosts, and its control in a CE endemic area of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco.</s>
            <s>Methods: We conducted twenty focus group discussions (FGDs) stratified by gender with villagers, butchers and students in ten Berber villages that were purposefully selected for their CE prevalence.</s>
            <s>Results: This community considers CE to be a severe and relatively common disease in humans and animals but has a poor understanding of the parasite's life cycle.</s>
            <s>Risk behaviour and disabling factors for disease control are mainly related to cultural practices in sheep breeding and home slaughtering, dog keeping, and offal disposal at home, as well as in slaughterhouses.</s>
            <s>Participants in our focus group discussions were supportive of control measures as management of canine populations, waste disposal, and monitoring of slaughterhouses.</s>
            <s>Conclusions: The uncontrolled stray dog population and dogs having access to offal (both at village dumps and slaughterhouses) suggest that authorities should be more closely involved in CE control.</s>
            <s>This study also highlights the need for improved knowledge about the transmission cycle of the parasite among communities and health professionals.</s>
            <s>Inter-sectoral collaboration between health staff, veterinarians, and social scientists appears to be crucial for sustainable control of this parasitic zoonosis.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Cystic echinococcosis (CE), also known as human hydatidosis, is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus.</s>
          <s>Dogs and wild Canidae are the definitive hosts, while domestic Ungulates act as intermediate hosts.</s>
          <s>Humans are accidental dead-end hosts.</s>
          <s>Considerable phenotypic and genetic variability exists within the E. granulosus species.</s>
          <s>Several strains have been identified with differences in intermediate host spectrum, biological characteristics, and geographical distribution <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Globally, most human cases of CE are caused by the sheep strain E. granulosus sensu stricto (characterized as the genotypes G1, G2 and G3) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A common misconception is that humans become infected when eating uncooked meat.</s>
          <s>In reality, CE is transmitted via the faeco-oral route.</s>
          <s>Intermediate hosts become infected through ingestion of parasite eggs that are passed through the dog's faeces.</s>
          <s>Humans are infected when consuming contaminated food or water, or through close contact with infected soil or objects (with subsequent ingestion of eggs), including dogs' mouths and fur.</s>
          <s>An infection in livestock and humans leads to the development of a hydatid cyst in the liver, lungs, or more rarely, other organs <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While animals rarely show clinical symptoms, clinical signs and symptoms in humans may develop months or years after infection, and are caused by the expanding cysts and inflammatory reactions <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Severe cases can only be treated surgically.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>CE is a worldwide health problem primarily affecting pastoral and poor rural communities where people raise livestock in close contact with dogs fed on raw offal <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The latest global burden of CE is estimated at 184,000 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), − one DALY being defined as 1 year of healthy life lost due to ill-health, disability and/or early death -, for a total cost of US$3 billion attributed to CE-related health care costs and losses in the livestock sector <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>CE is highly endemic in North Africa and the Middle East.</s>
          <s>In these regions, incidence rates in humans can exceed 50 per 100,000 person-years <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2012, Morocco recorded an average of 5.2 surgical cases per 100,000 inhabitants (DELM, 2012) and a mortality rate estimated at 2-3% <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>

          <s>The last epidemiological study in the Mid Atlas showed a prevalence of abdominal CE of 1.9% based on ultrasound examination <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Official data from the Ministry of Health reported 722 surgical CE cases in 2014 <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The overall annual cost to both the Moroccan health and livestock sector has been valued at nearly €1,000,000, though data are fragmented <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to a study conducted in five regions of Morocco, prevalence of infection ranges from 23.0% in cattle, <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .8% in Equidae, 12.0% in camels, 10.6% in sheep, to 1.9% in goats.</s>

          <s>A study conducted in the province of Sidi Kacem (northwest Morocco) between 2010 and 2011 found an E. granulosus infection prevalence of <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .3% in pet dogs <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although Morocco is considered a highly endemic country for CE <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , this obvious lack of data illustrates clearly the persisting neglect of zoonotic diseases in terms of funding opportunities for epidemiological research, of national health priorities, and consequently of validation of effective CE control strategies and of efficient surveillance measures.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Illiteracy, weak infrastructure and limited economic resources in rural and suburban areas in Morocco play a major role in the distribution of CE.</s>
          <s>The irrigation systems, extensive sheep breeding, high numbers of stray dogs, and poor hygiene in slaughterhouses create ideal conditions for transmission <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Both women involved in agricultural activities, and children who come into close contact with dogs, are particularly at risk <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Control of echinococcosis is difficult due to the complex nature of the parasite's life cycle, the number of animal species acting as potential (intermediate) hosts, and the requirement for intersectoral cooperation between agricultural, veterinary, and health authorities <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Nowadays, the Eg95 vaccine for sheep <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , registered in some parts of the world, combined with cestodicidal treatment of dogs, shows a strong potential to control this disease <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although the Moroccan Government established an "Inter-Ministerial Committee" in 2007 and drew up guidelines to combat CE <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , the disease remains a significant public health problem in this country.</s>
          <s>Currently, hydatidosis control program managers in Morocco wish to gain a better understanding of the type of risk behaviours that persist in rural populations, and why they persist.</s>
          <s>This may improve the impact of their control efforts.</s>

            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> , indicate that human risk behaviour associated with poor understanding of the parasite life cycle by the population has a negative impact.</s>
          <s>However, no study has extensively studied the socio-cultural determinants influencing human behaviour and CE transmission, and no research is available for the High Atlas region.</s>

          <s>We conducted a qualitative research project based on focus group discussions in a predominantly rural area in the Northern fringes of the High Atlas Mountains, 30 to 50 km south of Marrakech in the Al Haouz province of Morocco.</s>
          <s>The study region was selected based on reports indicating high prevalence of E. granulosus in humans, sheep, and dogs (Report of the Haouz office, unpublished data), presence of extensive sheep breeding, a large number of free-roaming dogs, and backyard slaughtering without veterinary inspection.</s>
          <s>Six rural municipalities and one town (Tahannaout) were selected with the approval of the local authorities.</s>
          <s>The ten villages located among these seven municipalities were randomly selected from villages where the Caïd (chief of the rural municipality appointed by the state) agreed to the study.</s>

          <s>Participants also suggested burying animal carcasses sufficiently deep and with the help of others.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This qualitative study offers a deeper understanding of why rural communities in Morocco are engaged in behaviours resulting in the improper disposal of viscera at slaughtering, leading to high risk of E. granulosus infection in dogs <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The study was conducted in an epidemiological context representative of other rural settings in Morocco <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> and neighbouring countries <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> , where CE is principally maintained in a domestic dog-sheep cycle and affects mainly women and children.</s>
          <s>Respondents described specific risk behaviours leading to a very high environmental contamination with parasite eggs including inadequate sanitary practices regarding offal management, abundance and proximity of free roaming dogs looking for food, and low awareness of transmission risks.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Similar to previous studies carried out amongst the Berber people from the Middle Atlas (central Morocco) <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> , our results show that the occurrence of CE in both humans and animals is widely known in the studied community.</s>
          <s>Hydatid cysts and lesions were recognized and well described by our respondents, but their knowledge of the transmission cycle and the link to human disease was relatively poor and fragmented.</s>
          <s>In contrast to pastoralists <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> and findings from KAP study conducted in the Northwest of Morocco <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , our study population was well-aware of dogs being a source of infection, to the point of naming CE "dog disease" or "dog cysts".</s>
          <s>However, how dogs get infected and how they transmit the disease to humans and livestock was not well known by many of the participants.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>By partitioning the life cycle of E. granulosus according to its transmission paths between the three hosts (humans, sheep, dogs), and organizing all related quotes accordingly, we could picture participants' perceived life cycle of the parasite <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> , and identify the Control measure suggested only to the butchers corresponding knowledge gap(s).</s>
          <s>A perceived life cycle was described by <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">Marcotty et al. (2013)</ref> using preliminary data <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As in our previous study on Taenia solium <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref> , very few people had a comprehensive view of the parasite life cycle.</s>
          <s>While some pieces of the puzzle were easily identified (e.g.</s>
          <s>risks dog poses to human health), others were often lacking (e.g.</s>
          <s>infection of dogs through feeding on infected organs), and some putative hosts were erroneously added (e.g.</s>
          <s>cats).</s>
          <s>Finally, some transmission paths between hosts were easily identified (e.g.</s>
          <s>humans getting cysts from dogs), although the knowledge on how the disease was transmitted from one host to the other was not always accurate (e.g.</s>
          <s>humans getting cysts from dogs by their breath).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In contrast with the recent Moroccan KAP study <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , we observed that the main knowledge gaps varied between the stakeholders.</s>
          <s>The female students had very poor knowledge in general.</s>
          <s>They perceived the threats from the dogs as less serious compared to the other groups, and saw dogs more as pets.</s>
          <s>Very few butchers identified the dogs as a source of infection for humans, as for them the main risk for contracting CE in humans was eating infected offal.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, butchers were well aware that dogs could infect sheep.</s>
          <s>Very few women but most men made the link between infected offal and dog infection.</s>
          <s>Yet, more women than men considered eating infected offal less of a health issue.</s>
          <s>For men, the biggest problem was the disease transmission from dogs to humans.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>These data are very important to build efficient and adapted health promotion messages because the specific knowledge gaps explain several of the risk behaviours, especially regarding infected offal management.</s>
          <s>If women's responsibilities are to clean and manage viscera but, at the same time, these women do not perceive the hazard of feeding dogs with infected offal, the parasite's life cycle will be maintained.</s>
          <s>This finding is in line with other Moroccan studies that highlighted that safe disposal of offal with cysts is downplayed because only human consumption of cysts is considered holding a disease risk and not consumption by dogs <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Undeniably, offal are very often made accessible to dogs, voluntarily or involuntarily, at slaughterhouses, souks, open air uncontrolled dumping, streets, and rivers, which is the main reason for the persistence of the disease <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These offal management practices however, are not only mediated by lack of awareness, but also by various social determinants including religion, gender, and food preparation norms of sheep offal, which influence how households consume and discard infected offal.</s>
          <s>During the Eïd el-Kebir festival, the Moroccan tradition consists of preparing organ meat such as sheep liver and heart on the day of slaughter.</s>
          <s>The liver is grilled first by the men of the family partly for practical and sanitary reasons (organs are best eaten fresh), but mainly because of the liver's symbolic and social value which strongly competes with its commercial value <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a "concentrated life form", the liver of the animal is considered as the seat of the filial love, hence the importance of its physical integrity especially during the yearly sheep sacrifice festival.</s>
          <s>Other viscera are also seen as preserving the honour of the family <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44]</ref> and attracting the "Baraka" (flow of blessings and grace) to the whole family <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, all damages, black spots, and cysts should be removed from the organs and disposed of, which often makes them accessible to dogs (see above offal management practices), allowing the maintenance of the parasite's life cycle.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The place given to dogs by the Muslim culture and some related religious precepts translated from the Koran by Imams in hadiths (Muslim laws) explain why dogs should be well treated like all other God creatures (dogs have a soul and therefore the right to live) or killed if they attack, but also why they are so often blamed as the source of cysts found in humans even though they are asymptomatic for E. granulosus infection.</s>
          <s>A close relationship with them is discouraged since they are hygienically and spiritually perceived as impure animals.</s>
          <s>This is even more the case for "unwanted" stray dogs, because they chase away protective angels from entering a house.</s>
          <s>The dirt brought by impure animals needs to be washed away.</s>
          <s>These Muslim cultural and religious beliefs, referring to the miasma theory <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> , constitute probably an underlying explanation of several practices regarding dog keeping in the Middle East and North Africa, where stray dogs are abundant, and where there is often no legislation in relation to responsible dog ownership and formal control of reproduction <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to our results, dogs, even owned, most often roam freely, and this may be because tying them up would imply to physically touch their "impurity".</s>
          <s>In the context of Tibetan herdsmen, Heath et al. <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> advocated for more participatory planning between dog-owners and community leaders to enable a choice of possible control strategies that suit both the social and economic status of a particular target community.</s>
          <s>However, waste management and hygiene negligence, both from the rural communities and the authorities, was often mentioned in our study as a barrier to any control measures.</s>
          <s>This discrimination of rural and more remote areas by the state and by the authorities felt by our studied population was also identified in recent studies conducted in Morocco <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41,</ref>

          <s>Aside from the control measures discussed, health promotion, including health education and awareness creation, was spontaneously raised by some participants.</s>
          <s>Others recommended several methods for organizing and implementing these awareness-raising campaigns in a more effective way, e.g.</s>
          <s>face-to-face meetings, radio messages in Berber language, etc.</s>
          <s>These proposals should certainly be considered when designing sensitization programs.</s>

          <s>The dissemination of the life cycle of E. granulosus and risk factors contributing to human infections is the biggest challenge for CE control <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ducrotoy et al. <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> , who evaluated an integrated health messaging intervention for five zoonotic diseases in northwest Morocco, including CE, showed similar findings.</s>
          <s>Their intervention had different outcomes according to the target audience (men, women, and children) because of the educative role and norms at household level, and children remained the most receptive group <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Behavioural Change Education regarding dog keeping, livestock husbandry, personal hygiene, and home-based slaughter practices is important but would never be enough to tackle conceptual and operational challenges in the design of efficient interventions at the "human-animal-ecosystem" interface <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The scope of our research mainly focused on the biosocial dynamics of the parasite at the household level, yet the ones in place at slaughterhouse level also present a lot of challenges for controlling this disease, as highlighted by Bardosh et al. <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The butcher groups made fewer comments regarding dogs because the topic of perception, role, and status of dogs was not included in their FGDs (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>As a powerful lobby group and because of the complex socio-political processes that exist among the different stakeholders involved in slaughterhouses management such as veterinary technicians and politicians <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> , butchers may have strategically controlled their answers when asked about the presence of dogs in the slaughterhouse, the management of discarded offal, and meat inspection to avoid getting attention from the authorities and the implementation of additional control measures on their work.</s>

          <s>Sheep management was not included in the discussion guide for women.</s>
          <s>However, we discovered that women are the ones taking care of the livestock (although the decision-making still remains the responsibility of the men).</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>The observed differences regarding CE perception between four social strata raise the challenge of engaging these different social groups in CE prevention and control.</s>
          <s>This means that looking at each group category and their prioritized control measures might be a good approach as previously advocated by <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">Battelli (2009)</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, to remain feasible and "salable" to program managers, the specificities of each group should be jointly prioritized through a consensual participative approach.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>For example, free roaming dogs are key in the continued disease transmission in our studied ecosystem.</s>
          <s>Supporting dog-owners by, identifying their needs, dog sterilization, awareness campaigns, mobile vet care, free deworming, etc., is essential for effective CE control, but interventions for the management of stray dogs in this rural remote area must also be designed.</s>
          <s>In our study, killing unowned stray dogs perceived as harmful was identified as the most acceptable control measure, despite Islam not allowing the killing of any living beings.</s>
          <s>Therefore, stray dogs should be visually distinguished from free-roaming owned dogs, by collars, ear tags, etc.. Local authorities should also elaborate integrated strategies through the rabies control program created in 2000 by the ONSSA (Office National de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> to manage the size of dog populations.</s>
          <s>Also, to restore the trust of the population in their local authorities and ensure a successful and long-term hydatid disease control program, integrating "mediators" such as local associations and NGOs could be explored.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As culture is always evolving, adapted control measures must be implemented and negotiated with the population to be effective and sustainable.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we suggest a reflective bottom-up approach of progressive problem solving starting with a mapping of all the stakeholders involved in this control program, and a qualitative evaluation of their respective knowledge of this program and its activities, their role, their perception of its efficiency, and implementation.</s>
          <s>At the same time, it would be beneficial when redesigning and implementing the activities of the Moroccan CE control program to improve CE knowledge of both medical professionals and communities via health promotion techniques, taking into account the socio-cultural context of these groups.</s>
          <s>Medical doctors working in these remote areas could play an important role in knowledge transfer of CE control, while students who were perceived and perceived themselves in our study as "vanguards" of behaviour change within their immediate families and the wider community could also make a considerable contribution.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, vaccination of sheep was not included in the discussions as this was not available as a control option at the time of our study (2009).</s>
          <s>However, the Institute of Agriculture and Veterinary Hassan II (Rabat), together with the support of Belgian universities 3 is currently evaluating the efficacy and acceptability of the Eg95 vaccine for sheep.</s>

Rains contribute to the egg dissemination, and the cold and humid climate allows their survival in the environment. Through direct or indirect contacts with dogs, ruminants (through grazing) and humans (through contamination of hands, food, and water) are infected by dogs' faeces. Dogs become infected when feeding on organs infected with hydatid cysts (larval stage). b Dogs first, and infected sheep meat, a close second, are seen as the two main sources of human hydatidosis. Sheep, and to a lesser extent, humans, get infected in humid or cold climatic conditions or in unhygienic environments. Dogs, as well as cats, are thought to contribute to hydatidosis and other diseases in humans through saliva, hairs, and bites. Infection of dogs through feeding on infected organs is not perceived as a risk.

Obstacles 

1 
Kill stray dogs only Help eliminate dogs and 
their threats 

Replace sheep 
with goats 

Against the culture (food habits, religion); many 
disadvantages of goat herding 

2 
Stop feeding dogs 
with sheep cysts 

Contribute to decreasing the disease Kill all dogs 
Some dogs have a role (useful) and the right to live 
(have a soul) 

3 
Feeding dogs 
personally 

Prevent dogs going out to look 
for their food and returning 
with diseases 

Stop feeding dogs 
with sheep cysts 

Cysts can be found anywhere else (souk, slaughterhouses) 

4 
Prevention versus 
treatment 

a 

More efficient than treatment 
Feeding dogs 
yourself 

Impossible to educate a dog (big appetite) 

5 
Kill all dogs 
Fewer problems 
Kill stray dogs only 
Dogs always reappear (reproduction difficult to control) 
especially if culling campaigns are not carried out regularly 

6 
Bury infected offal Prevent dogs' access to offal 
No more 
owning dogs 

Dogs are needed 

7 
Stop owning dogs Not specified 
Do not throw 
away carcases 

Too costly and time consuming to bury them 

8 
Stop throwing 
away carcasses 

Avoid the bad smell 
Bury wasted offal 
Dogs have a strong sense of smell and offal is not buried 
deep enough 

9 
Replace sheep 
with goats 

Healthier meat with fewer cysts 
found (less contacts with dogs) 

Burn infected offal 
Too costly 

10 
Burn infected offal Prevent dogs having access to offal 
and people having to retrieve them 
Avoid bad smell 

Reduce dogs' access 
to slaughterhouses 

b 

Not the best method to control the disease because it does 
not come from the slaughterhouse but from the pastures
