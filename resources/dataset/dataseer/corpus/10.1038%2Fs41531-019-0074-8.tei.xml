          <s>Medicare beneficiaries who are dual-eligible and have a neurodegenerative disease, like Parkinson disease (PD), have often qualified for Medicaid due to loss of wealth from health care expenses and/or long-term care services.</s>
          <s>For dualeligible individuals over the age of 65, Medicare remains the primary payer for office visits, hospitalizations, home health, and skilled nursing facility care; Medicaid assists with remaining costs of care.</s>

        <head>DISCUSSION</head>
        <p>
          <s>In this descriptive study, we determined that among Medicare beneficiaries, there is significant state-level variation in PD prevalence, demography, dual-eligible status, and spending.</s>
          <s>States which have a higher prevalence of PD may have a larger proportion of high-risk factor patient groups, a higher concentration of providers who recognize and document PD, increased public awareness of PD symptoms, or increased health care seeking behaviors among people living in the state.</s>
          <s>Among our top PD prevalence states, Florida and New York also rank high in terms of absolute number of Medicare beneficiaries, and have large supplies of health care providers.</s>
          <s>Environmental factors, including exposure to exogenous toxicants (such as pesticides, <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> heavy metals, <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> or solvents 17 ) vary by location and may influence our prevalence estimates by altering the risk of PD or of a PD diagnosis.</s>
          <s>There are proposed protective factors for PD, such as coffee consumption <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> and exercise habits, 20,21 but it is not clear whether these vary sufficiently across states to impact PD prevalence estimates.</s>
          <s>Finally, prevalence calculations can be impacted by differential mortality.</s>
          <s>Future research will seek to understand the geographic variation of PD in terms of differences in risk, mortality, and diagnostic accuracy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The strongest risk factor for PD is age.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> Therefore, it is not surprising that PD prevalence estimates for individuals aged 45 and above were substantially lower than those estimated using a population sample aged 65 and older.</s>
          <s>These lower prevalence estimates reflect the uncommonness of PD diagnoses among individuals below the age of 60 and highlights the importance of presenting age-stratified data for PD burden estimates, particularly if that data includes very low-risk subpopulations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The geographic variation in the proportion of dual-eligible individuals among PD is more challenging to explain.</s>
          <s>The most concerning potential contributing factors to high proportions of dual eligibles in a state are increased need for permanent nursing facility care due to suboptimal management of PD, or an increased incidence of outcomes that precipitate nursing home placement, such as cognitive impairment or falls with injury.</s>
          <s>Ease of obtaining Medicaid may also explain a portion of our findings; states with above-average percentages of dual eligible may have a higher relative income threshold for Medicaid eligibility, or formal/ informal processes in place that facilitate Medicaid receipt.</s>
          <s>While Medicaid eligibility is administered at the state level, federal subsidies are given to states to offset the costs of the program.</s>
          <s>The amount of federal support varies from state to state, as decided by state leaders.</s>
          <s>For example, the District of Columbia, California, Arkansas, Ohio, and Connecticut, which had some of the highest proportions of dual eligible PD patients, had also opted to expand Medicaid eligibility as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and had done so by 2014.</s>
          <s>ACA-supported Medicaid expansion was not designed to impact older dual eligibles; however, there may be spillover effects that result in the increased pursuit of Medicaid eligibility by PD patients in these states.</s>
          <s>Other states in the top quartile for dual eligibles-Mississippi, Louisiana, and Indiana-also have the highest proportions of individuals living at or below the poverty line.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> The interplay between the need for long-term care services, subsidies, income, and Medicaid eligibility is complex.</s>

          <s>Female Medicare beneficiaries outnumber male beneficiaries, and women have a greater life expectancy, both in the general population <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> and among individuals with PD. <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29</ref> Thus, our finding that nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries with PD are female is expected.</s>
          <s>Although women diagnosed with PD are a sizable portion of the PD population, they are highly underrepresented in PD research and clinical trials.</s>
          <s>Recent data suggests that current payer models and care patterns do not meet the needs of women with PD, who have less access to specialized care and greater unreimbursed care needs.</s>

            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> In the general population, such variation is suggested to be due to regional differences in health care seeking behavior, increased need due to greater comorbid disease burden or social determinants of health, or increased availability of providers.</s>

            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> Hospitalization for PD specialist care, such as deep brain stimulator (DBS) implantation, could contribute to our observed differences, particularly in states with multiple academic centers, however previous research has demonstrated that DBS use among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD is very low.</s>

          <s>Not surprisingly, we found that beneficiaries with PD have increased health care utilization and spending compared to those without PD, which is consistent with prior, smaller studies performed in the US.</s>

          <s>Variation in spending patterns may be due to local practice patterns, 7,45 migration patterns of higher-risk individuals, 2,46 or both.</s>
          <s>The proportion of state expenditures related to PD care will rise as PD prevalence increases; research to understand these variations is necessary to develop policies aimed at reducing state health care expenditures associated with undesired patient or clinical outcomes.</s>

            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> In particular, economic burden data that includes the younger PD population is needed, not only to provide a complete picture of the economic burden of PD, but also because younger individuals with PD are less likely to have comorbid conditions.</s>
          <s>Thus, in this age group, medical expenditures may more directly reflect PD care costs alone.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of state-level variation in PD prevalence and spending patterns among the Medicare population.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, some important limitations should be noted.</s>
          <s>We relied on administrative claims data from a single year, which may not be representative of broader secular trends in PD care.</s>
          <s>Medicare administrative claims data have been shown to be both accurate and valid <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">48</ref> and are commonly used in studies of spending, enabling comparison to other chronic diseases.</s>
          <s>Medicare data obtained for research purposes has been subject to a strict quality assurance process.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, unrecognized errors in coding or reporting may occur and may be non-random.</s>
          <s>Lastly, we cannot determine the extent to which spending differences were due to hyperlocal market forces, patient factors, or physician preference.</s>
          <s>Prior studies suggest that all three factors impact the cost of care.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46</ref> More study is needed to identify the major drivers for health care spending for individuals with PD.</s>
          <s>Despite these limitations, our study provides initial evidence that there is substantial geographic variation in health service use and spending for PD.</s>
          <s>Understanding the drivers of health care costs and needs for individuals with PD is necessary to guide state-and federal-level health policies that support cost efficiency and whole person outcomes for PD patients.</s>
          <s>Our data are important from a population health and policy perspective, but can also provide meaningful information to clinicians, as knowing the burden of Parkinson's disease in one's state is important for physician leaders, and hospital and medical school administrators to plan for and advocate for adequate provider supplies.</s>
