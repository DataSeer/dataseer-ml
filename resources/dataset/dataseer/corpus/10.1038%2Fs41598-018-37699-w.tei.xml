          <s>Identification of a minimal stable SANT1 construct.</s>
          <s>Though highly conserved, the function of the EZH2 SANT1 domain is currently unknown.</s>
          <s>In order to investigate this domain, we first identified a minimal stable construct.</s>
          <s>An initial construct was designed based on domain limit predictions made by the SMART server, which indicate that the minimal structured domain spans residues 159-251 <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>This initial construct was successfully purified out of E. coli.</s>
          <s>However, an 1 H-15 N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum revealed only 33 main chain resonances.</s>
          <s>This is substantially less than what would be expected, based on 88 non-proline residues, and assuming fast conformational exchange on the NMR timescale <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1b, left)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Of the observable resonances, the majority were degenerate in chemical shift lying largely between 7.5ppm and 8.5ppm in the 1 H dimension.</s>
          <s>Together this suggests that residues 159-251 are either not sufficient to form a stably folded domain or that the domain is undergoing dramatic conformational dynamics on the intermediate timescale leading to significant line-broadening and disappearance of peaks in the spectrum.</s>
          <s>In an attempt to stabilize the domain fold, a second construct was generated incorporating an additional 18 residues at the N-terminus, resulting in a construct spanning residues 141-251.</s>
          <s>This second construct contains a large part of what has now been termed the stimulation response motif (SRM) separated by a small linker <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>An 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of the SRM-SANT1 construct contained 100 resonances <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1b, right)</ref> , revealing that the SRM and SRM-SANT1 linker stabilize the SANT1 domain.</s>
          <s>The majority of the SRM-SANT1 resonances are well-dispersed in the 1 H and 15 N dimensions, suggestive of a well-folded domain.</s>
          <s>All additional studies were performed with the SRM-SANT1 construct containing residues 141-251.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Structural Characterization of EZH2 SRM-SANT1.</s>
          <s>In order to further characterize the SRM-SANT1 construct, backbone amide resonances were assigned through analysis of HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HNCACO and HCCH-TOCSY spectra.</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S2</ref> , 84 resonances were unambiguously assigned.</s>
          <s>The remaining 16 resonances have largely degenerate chemical shift in both 1 H and 15 N and/or correspond to large stretches of degenerate amino acid types precluding assignment.</s>
          <s>To assess the secondary structure of SRM-SANT1, we analyzed the chemical shifts using Talos+ <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>This provides a measure of α-helix or β-sheet propensity on a per residue basis from analysis of the HN, Hα, Cα, Cβ, CO and N chemical shifts.</s>
          <s>Positive values denote α-helix and negative values β-sheet, with the magnitude indicating the predicted propensity to form these secondary structures.</s>
          <s>Order parameters (S 2 ) can also be predicted, which indicate the magnitude of flexibility (ranging from 0-1, with 1 being the most rigid).</s>
          <s>Three regions were identified with significant alpha helical propensity corresponding to residues 168-178 (α1 helix), 221-230 (α2 helix) and 237-247 (α3 helix), which corresponds to the SANT domain <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, a moderate helical propensity is seen for residues in the SRM <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Correspondingly, a slight increase in predicted order parameters (S 2 ) is seen in this region as compared to the random coil regions <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Together this suggests that the SRM transiently samples a helical conformation.</s>
          <s>The remaining assigned residues are predicted to be in a random coil conformation.</s>
          <s>Though the unassigned resonances cannot be fully evaluated the majority of them are degenerate in chemical shift and lie in the middle of the spectrum suggesting that they belong to unstructured regions ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S2a</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The predicted secondary structure of the SANT1 domain is consistent with the canonical SANT/Myb domain fold, which is characterized by a three-helix bundle stabilized by the interaction of aromatic residues located in or just outside each of the three helices.</s>
          <s>Indeed, SANT1 contains three aromatic residues within or just adjacent to each helix; F171 (α1 helix), F224 (α2 helix) and Y244 (α3 helix) (Supplementary Figs S1 and S3).</s>
          <s>To confirm that these are the stabilizing residues, mutant constructs were generated in which each of these aromatics was substituted with Ala, and scanning wavelength circular dichroism (CD) was used to assess the fold.</s>
          <s>The CD spectrum of wild-type SANT1 contains negative ellipticity minima at 208 nm and 220 nm, which is consistent with alpha helical secondary structure ( <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In contrast, the CD spectrum of F224A contains a single negative ellipticity minimum at 198 nm, consistent with a completely random coil secondary structure ( <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S3c</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The CD spectra of F171A and Y244A have negative ellepticity minima at 208 nm and 220 nm, but show a significant decrease in total ellepticity signal suggesting these mutations significantly destabilize the global structure of the domain without completely unfolding it ( <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S3b,d)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Together, this confirms that F171, F224 and Y244 make up the hydrophobic core of SANT1, and that all three residues are required for the domain fold.</s>
          <s>Notably, a major difference in SANT1 compared to the canonical SANT domains is the size of the α1-α2 loop.</s>
          <s>Most SANT domains harbor short inter-helical segments comprised of ~5-10 residues <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Though the α2-α3 loop is only 7 residues, the α1-α2 loop is extremely long at 42 residues.</s>
          <s>Our NMR data suggests that this loop is entirely unstructured, which is not surprising considering the low sequence complexity and high percentage of acidic residues (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).</s>
          <s>The size of this loop also likely contributes to the increased conformational dynamics observed for the minimal SANT1 construct.</s>
          <s>As mentioned previously, during the course of our studies, four crystal structures of PRC2 were solved <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Minimal complexes of yeast (Chaetomium thermophilum), human, and a mixed species (human SUZ12 and EED, and chameleon EZH2) were captured in either the basal, stimulated, or inhibitor-bound states.</s>
          <s>Importantly residues 183-211, corresponding to the SANT1 α1-α2 loop, were deleted in the complex containing human EZH2 in order to facilitate crystallization <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> .</s>
          <s>Comparison of our secondary structure analysis to the SANT1 domain in the crystal structure reveals very good agreement, indicating that this deletion did not substantially perturb the SANT1 fold in the crystal structure.</s>
          <s>The SRM does not have discernable electron density in the basal PRC2 complex lacking activating peptide <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus it was predicted that the SRM undergoes an unstructured to structured transition upon PRC2 association with peptides corresponding to H3K27me3 (yeast complex) or Jarid2K119me3 (human complex), where it is seen to form an alpha helix <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our results suggest that the SRM transiently samples this active conformation in the isolated state, perhaps contributing to the basal activity of the complex, and suggest that the activating peptide simply stabilizes this conformation upon binding.</s>

          <s>SANT1 is a histone reader domain specific for the H4 tail.</s>
