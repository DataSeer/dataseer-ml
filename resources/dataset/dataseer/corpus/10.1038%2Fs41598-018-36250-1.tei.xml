            <s>Quantum dots (QDs) have been envisaged as very promising materials for the development of advanced optical sensors.</s>
            <s>Here we report a new highly porous luminescent material based on colloidal QDs for potential applications in optical sensing devices.</s>
            <s>Bulk flower-like porous structures with sizes of hundreds of microns have been produced by slow destabilization of QD solution in the presence of a non-solvent vapor.</s>
            <s>The porous highly luminescent material was formed from CdSe QDs using the approach of non-solvent destabilization.</s>
            <s>This material demonstrated a 4-fold decrease in PL signal in the presence of the ammonia vapor.</s>
            <s>The relationship between the destabilization rate of QDs in solution and the resulting morphology of structural elements has been established.</s>
            <s>The proposed model of bulk porous flower-like nanostructured material fabrication can be applied to nanoparticles of different nature combining their unique properties.</s>
            <s>This research opens up a new approach to design novel multi-component composite materials enabling potential performance improvements of various photonic devices.</s>

          <s>To derive the best synthetic protocol for formation of suitable material 4 different methods of destabilization of colloidal solution were used: slow evaporation 44 (sample QD1), slow evaporation in the non-solvent vapor presence 45 (sample QD2), destabilization by non-solvent 46 (sample QD3), destabilization by addition of the ligand molecules 47 (sample QD4).</s>
          <s>Also, a reference sample was prepared by setting a Si substrate in a colloidal solution for 1 month, designated further as QD5.</s>
          <s>Thus, 5 samples were produced from Cd 1−x Zn x Se 1−y S y /ZnS QDs assembled on inclined Si substrates.</s>
          <s>For testing the sensor performance of samples with different morphology, superstructures based on CdSe QD were prepared by destabilization in the presence of non-solvent (vapor and in solution).</s>
          <s>All details are given in Methods and Supporting Information (S1). .</s>
          <s>Typical morphology of QD2 is a bulk porous structure consisting of large spiky flowers, as shown at Figs 1b,c and S3 in Supporting Information, with various diameters basically from 200 to 500 μm which was formed on the lower part of Si substrate.</s>
          <s>Analysis of SEM images showed that the mean pore size is 26.5 μm (statistics considered at least 35 pores).</s>
          <s>In QD3 superstructures with various shapes were found: spikes, flowers, smooth spheres.</s>
          <s>The sizes of spiky flowers (see Figs 1d and S4 in Supporting Information) were estimated to be 6.7-20.7 μm.</s>
          <s>The estimated average pore size is 0.3-0.7 μm.</s>
          <s>Globular microflowers and small flabellate structures are located in the upper-middle part of the Si substrate with sizes varying from 3 to 6 μm.</s>
          <s>Small smooth spheres with diameters of 0.5 to 2.8 μm occupy a large area of the middle part of the substrate.</s>
          <s>The QD4 sample was obtained after the temperature decrease.</s>
          <s>The excess of oleic acid prevented the SEM analysis due to following aspects: the electron beams destroy organics in the sample affecting their morphology, and resulting images have low contrast.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the morphology of QD4 was explored by means of optical microscopy in reflected light (Figs 1e and S5 in Supporting Information).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Analysis of the morphology of the QD4 and QD5 samples does not reveal any ordered structures.</s>
          <s>It can be explained by the lack of chemical destabilization of the QD solution.</s>
          <s>In cases of QD4 and QD5 QDs deposition on the substrate from solution in random order and the formation of an amorphous structure occurred.</s>
          <s>These QD solutions were almost stable, since they were prepared in conditions which prevent solvent evaporation.</s>
          <s>QD4 sample was produced after decreasing the temperature and the deposition was caused by the crystallization of oleic acid in solution.</s>
          <s>The formation of the reference QD5 sample was very slow.</s>
          <s>We assume that QDs precipitated on the substrate under gravitational forces.</s>
          <s>The analysis of ordered superstructures' morphology showed that there is dependence in set of samples QD1-QD3 related to the rate of colloidal solution destabilization.</s>
          <s>A model of the interaction of nanoparticles in colloidal solution during a destabilization was offered in our previous work <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43</ref> .</s>
          <s>Following the proposed model, nanocrystals move chaotically in the colloidal solution, their movement in this environment can be described using the translational (v trans ) and orientational (v orient ) diffusion rates, and the rate of destabilization of the solution (v dest ) for the nanoparticle assembly by destabilization of colloidal solution.</s>
          <s>In the set QD1-QD3 samples v dest increases.</s>
          <s>According to this model, the spiky flowers will form at high v orient /v trans ratio due to the oriented attachment mechanism, which was observed in QD1 and QD2.</s>
          <s>However, these parameters influence the process of superstructure formation in nonlinear way: in the set QD1-QD3 the type of morphology changes from spiky structures to smooth spheres that is in agreement with v orient /v trans ratio, while size of structural elements is the largest for the QD2 sample.</s>
          <s>Thus, size of superstructures is also influenced by the presence of non-solvent.</s>
          <s>Let us consider this aspect in more detail.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the case of QD1, the quantum dots started to self-assemble on the substrate (or on the walls of the vial), so the materials were formed as flat spiky structures and their growing occurred along the substrate.</s>
          <s>In QD2 and QD3 samples, structures began to form in solution, followed by settling on the substrate.</s>
          <s>This is caused by the destabilization of the solution in the presence of non-solvent, which in turn affects the chemical interactions of QD in solution.</s>
          <s>Thereby, in QD3 separate structural elements (globular flowers and spiky flowers) were observed.</s>
          <s>In QD2, after the settling, the structures continued to grow because of the slower rate of destabilization of the solution compared with QD3 and presence of available QDs in the vicinity of the superstructure.</s>
          <s>Thus, the QD1 preparation method resulting in flat irregular structures is not suitable for the application in sensor fabrication.</s>
          <s>By contrast to that the QD2 preparation method leads to the formation of uniform porous structural elements with mean size of hundreds of microns.</s>
          <s>Therefore, this nanostructured material has a large surface area, which, as mentioned before, is one of the significant factors in developing highly efficient sensor materials.</s>

          <s>It is probable that QDs PL quenching may be due to a long-range electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer 50 from the QD to the NH-vibration in the ammonia molecule.</s>

          <s>By varying the destabilization rate in the presence of the non-solvent smaller structures can be formed with different shape: from spiky flowers to smooth spheres, which were found in the QD3 sample.</s>
          <s>The change in the surfactant molecule to QD molar ratio did not lead to the formation of desirable bulk porous structures.</s>
          <s>Optical properties of superstructures formed remains almost the same compared to the parent QD solution.</s>
          <s>Decrease in PL lifetime for shorter components was observed for all samples, with an increase of longer lifetime amplitude in the case of QD2 and QD5 samples.</s>
          <s>This can be attributed to the appearance of QDs interactions within bulk ensembles formed.</s>
          <s>The comparison of optical properties with morphology of superstructures revealed that the preparation method with non-solvent destabilization is suitable for producing a material for sensor applications.</s>
          <s>It was confirmed on the porous superstructures formed by the core type CdSe QDs sensitive to the ammonia vapor.</s>
          <s>The 4-fold decrease in PL signal was observed for the best sample.</s>
          <s>It is worth to mention, that the optical properties were restored to the initial values, thus enabling to reuse such material without additional purification procedures.</s>
          <s>Importantly, these preparation approaches can be applied to nanoparticles of different nature along with their mixtures.</s>
          <s>Thus, these methods are expected to induce the rapid development of nanostructured porous materials with improved and controlled luminescent properties and morphology for new advanced optical sensor devices.</s>

Baranov 1 Quantum dots (QDs) have been envisaged as very promising materials for the development of advanced optical sensors. Here we report a new highly porous luminescent material based on colloidal QDs for potential applications in optical sensing devices. Bulk flower-like porous structures with sizes of hundreds of microns have been produced by slow destabilization of QD solution in the presence of a non-solvent vapor. The porous highly luminescent material was formed from CdSe QDs using the approach of non-solvent destabilization. This material demonstrated a 4-fold decrease in PL signal in the presence of the ammonia vapor. The relationship between the destabilization rate of QDs in solution and the resulting morphology of structural elements has been established. The proposed model of bulk porous flower-like nanostructured material fabrication can be applied to nanoparticles of different nature combining their unique properties. This research opens up a new approach to design novel multi-component composite materials enabling potential performance improvements of various photonic devices.</figDesc>
