            <s>The relationship between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and preterm delivery has become well known in recent years, although there are few studies on: (i) the differences in test results during the early gestational (EGP) and middle gestational (MGP) periods; (ii) the significance of the intermediate (I) group that does not develop overt BV; or (iii) the therapeutic effects of metronidazole.</s>
            <s>We performed a retrospective study to analyze the relationship between the vaginal bacterial status and the preterm delivery rate.</s>
            <s>Without treatment, the preterm delivery rate was higher in the BV subgroup than in the I and normal (N) subgroups (p = 0.021) in the EGP, whereas the rates in the BV and I subgroups were higher than in the N subgroup in the MGP (p = 0.0003).</s>
            <s>Although treatment of BV by metronidazole vaginal tablets significantly increased the N subgroup in the MGP (p = 0.020), there was no significant improvement in the preterm delivery rate.</s>
            <s>Decreasing the rate of preterm delivery requires development of treatment methods that will further increase the percentage of patients who test N during the MGP after BV during the EGP.</s>

          <s>Bacteria such as Lactobacillus lactis have an intravaginal cleansing effect in normal pregnancies, minimizing the presence of common bacterial species <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene of the vaginal bacterial communities of pregnant women showed that vaginal microbiome becomes more stable and less diverse as pregnancy progresses, which confers a protective role against ascending infection of the genital tract 2 .</s>
          <s>However, there are intravaginal microorganisms other than Lactobacillus species in some pregnancies that cause chorioamnionitis.</s>
          <s>This is because the normal flora (commensal bacteria) that colonize the vagina during pregnancy do not cause inflammatory conditions or vaginitis, such as occurs with infection by pathogenic bacteria.</s>
          <s>An imbalance in the normal vaginal bacteria is therefore known as bacterial vaginosis (BV).</s>
          <s>Chorioamnionitis is the main cause of preterm delivery, and various previous reports have stated that chorioamnionitis occurs against a background of BV <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
          <s>When BV causes vaginitis or cervicitis and then progresses to inflammation of all fetal membranes, it can in turn cause premature rupture of membranes and labor <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is therefore important to manage BV first in order to prevent preterm delivery.</s>
          <s>Metronidazole is the most effective antibiotic for BV.</s>
          <s>A 2007 Cochrane review stated that treating BV with antibiotics up to gestational week (GW) 20 prevents preterm delivery <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, many clinical trials and a 2013 Cochrane review reported no preventive effects on preterm delivery, despite administration of treatment for BV <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>

          <s>We performed BV screening on all pregnant women during the early gestational period (EGP) and middle gestational period (MGP) between 2004 and 2008 at our hospital.</s>
          <s>These patients remained untreated for BV.</s>
          <s>We also performed BV screening on all pregnant women during the EGP from 2010 onwards at our hospital.</s>
          <s>All of the latter patients diagnosed with BV were treated with metronidazole vaginal tablets.</s>
          <s>To begin with, this study retrospectively investigates the natural course of BV and its association with preterm delivery.</s>
          <s>We then analyze the therapeutic effects of metronidazole vaginal tablet administration and its preventive effects on preterm delivery.</s>

          <s>Until that time, one study had investigated the vaginal bacteria status in 718 pregnant patients and reported that approximately 50% of BV in the EGP had improved and normalized <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results are consistent with our current results.</s>
          <s>The reason for this improvement could be the increased quantity of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium, which increases Lactobacillus count <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> , although the precise mechanism is unclear and remains a challenge for future research.</s>
          <s>There have been several reports about the increased risk of preterm delivery when patients test positive for BV and consensus has been reached <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The reason that the results of the current study do not show preventive effects on preterm delivery, despite treatment of the BV patients in the EGP, may be because there were patients who did not fall under the N subgroup in the MGP and because those patients were at increased risk of preterm delivery <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 4C,D)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Metronidazole treatment usually cures BV because lactobacilli are resistant to metronidazole, whereas most of BV-causing bacteria are sensitive to metronidazole <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, in this study, insufficient patient compliance or a recurrence, which can be caused by sexual intercourse <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[32]</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33]</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref> , after an initially successful treatment at EGP, may be the reason of the apparently treatment-resistant cases.</s>
          <s>Additionally, treatment failure of BV can be caused by metronidazole-resistant Gardnerella vaginalis <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36</ref> or lack of lactobacilli 37 , and therefore, new forms of treatment may decrease the size of this treatment-resistant subgroup.</s>
          <s>For example, <ref type="bibr">Giunta et al.</ref> showed that the preterm delivery rate improves after administration of lactoferrin <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38</ref> .</s>
          <s>If these methods are combined, then the ratio that enters the N subgroup during the MGP may approach 100% and may be associated with decreased preterm delivery rates.</s>
          <s>One of the limitations of this study was that it was performed using historical controls, although the results suggest that there were no major differences between groups, except for the presence or absence of metronidazole vaginal tablet administration in the group 1 and 2 BV patients.</s>
          <s>Patients who fell into the I or N subgroup during the EGP, i.e., patients who were not treated with metronidazole, showed an unchanged cumulative delivery ratio &lt; GW 37 when compared with groups 1 and 2 on the whole.</s>
          <s>The preterm delivery rate was low during all periods <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">(Fig. 5A)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another limitation of this study was the small sample size.</s>
          <s>Non-significant differences observed in this study (i.e.</s>
          <s>Figs 4A and 5B) could be attributed to the small sample size.</s>
          <s>Given the low frequency of BV cases, randomized clinical trials involving large number of pregnant women would be required to develop a standardized treatment strategy for BV.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, our current results show that BV often improved spontaneously during pregnancy.</s>
          <s>In addition, the BV subgroup in the EGP and the BV or I subgroup in the MGP were at risk of preterm delivery.</s>
          <s>Vaginal bacterial findings improved when patients in the EGP BV subgroup were treated with metronidazole vaginal tablets for six days.</s>
          <s>However, due to the presence of some treatment-resistant patients, we did not observe any significant preventive effects on preterm delivery.</s>
          <s>The results of this study suggest a method for using intravaginal bacterial findings during pregnancy as a biomarker to evaluate the risk of preterm delivery.</s>
