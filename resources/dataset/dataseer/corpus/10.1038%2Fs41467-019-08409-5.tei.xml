            <s>Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is the most water-efficient cereal and one of the earliest domesticated plants.</s>
            <s>Here we report its high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assembly using a combination of short-read sequencing, single-molecule real-time sequencing, Hi-C, and a high-density genetic map.</s>
            <s>Phylogenetic analyses reveal two sets of homologous chromosomes that may have merged~5.6 million years ago, both of which exhibit strong synteny with other grass species.</s>
            <s>Broomcorn millet contains 55,930 proteincoding genes and 339 microRNA genes.</s>
            <s>We find Paniceae-specific expansion in several subfamilies of the BTB (broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac) subunit of ubiquitin E3 ligases, suggesting enhanced regulation of protein dynamics may have contributed to the evolution of broomcorn millet.</s>
            <s>In addition, we identify the coexistence of all three C 4 subtypes of carbon fixation candidate genes.</s>
            <s>The genome sequence is a valuable resource for breeders and will provide the foundation for studying the exceptional stress tolerance as well as C 4 biology.</s>

          <s>Among all cultivated cereals, broomcorn millet has the highest water use efficiency (WUE, harvestable yield per water-use), probably because of its low respiration rate, short life cycle <ref type="bibr">(60-90 days)</ref> , and high harvest index <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>

          <s>Broomcorn millet performs C 4 photosynthesis and is a close relative of the bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).</s>
          <s>C 4 plants are more efficient in carbon fixation and in the use of water and nitrogen compared to their C 3 relatives.</s>
          <s>Thus much effort has been made in engineering C 4 traits in C 3 crops such as rice.</s>
          <s>This requires a clear understanding of the molecular mechanism of C 4 carbon fixation.</s>
          <s>C 4 plants are traditionally classified into three subtypes based on the main decarboxylation enzyme: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK).</s>
          <s>However, multiple lines of evidence and mathematical modeling suggest the PEP-CK subtype does not operate independently and usually coexist as a supplemental pathway to either the NAD-ME or NADP-ME subtype <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>

          <s>In addition to being nutritious and water-use efficient, broomcorn millet is also important for understanding the origin of agriculture in Eurasia.</s>

          <s>By~3000 years BP, broomcorn millet had spread across Europe and other parts of the continent through trade routes along the mountain valleys of Central Eurasia <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>A survey of 98 landrace accessions of broomcorn millet using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicated that genetic diversity within this species is closely associated with its geographical origin, possibly reflecting its history of spread across the continent <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12</ref> .</s>

          <s>We find lineage-specific expansion of an ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit in the genome, which may have contributed to its adaptive evolution.</s>

          <s>The genome size was estimated to bẽ 923 Mb based on a K-mer analysis (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref> ; this value is consistent with the reported c-value for this species <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>Broomcorn millet is an allotetraploid with 36 chromosomes (2n = 4×= 36) <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>An 87-fold coverage of PacBio sequencing data were assembled using Canu 22 and error-corrected with PCR-free Illumina reads to reach an estimated consensus error rate of 0.004% (1 error per~25 kb), generating Pm_0390_v0.1 that contains 5541 contigs and has a contig N50 of 369 kb (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Supplementary Figure 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We sequenced 132 individuals from an F6 population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) at an average depth of~10-fold and constructed a genetic map consisting of 18 linkage groups (LG) and 221,787 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> ).</s>
          <s>We anchored 4146 contigs to this highdensity genetic map.</s>
          <s>We also arranged the contigs into 18 groups based on the spatial relationship deduced from an Hi-C assay.</s>
          <s>By combining the position information from the genetic map and the Hi-C experiment, we assembled 4250 contigs into 18 pseudochromosomes with a total length of 822 Mb (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> ).</s>
