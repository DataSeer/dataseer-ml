          <s>Using a dataset consisting of 18672 configurations obtained from NPT MMC simulations of the NaK eutectic alloy, we have presented a machine learning protocol that allows us to reveal a mapping between independently accessible attributes of a system and its various thermodynamic properties.</s>
          <s>Firstly, we have shown that three phases of the eutectic NaK alloy can be identified, liquid, crystalline solid, and amorphous solid along the annealing procedure with NPT MMC simulations.</s>
          <s>From the current simulations, 18672 configurations registering the Cartesian coordinates of 2000 atoms were saved for further analysis.</s>
          <s>Secondly, based on the Voronoi tessellation, a set of 48 topological attributes were calculated for each configuration.</s>
          <s>Thirdly, with machine learning techniques these topological attributes were reduced to 26 based on ranking, and further to 3 through principal component analysis.</s>
          <s>The latter were used to cluster the configurations into three data clusters.</s>
          <s>These data clusters reproduced almost perfectly the liquid, amorphous, and crystalline condensed phases determined with the simulations.</s>
          <s>As a fourth step, a verification of the validity of the splitting into data clusters was carried out with the Random Forest classification.</s>
          <s>Analysis of these classes and the connection to the temperatures at which the configurations were obtained allowed to validate the clustering process and provided a robust estimate of the temperature range at which the system melts, 220-310 K, and at which the system transitions into a amorphous-like solid at 130-170 K.</s>
          <s>The methodology presented here is relevant for identifying (or screening) unknown materials with a targeted combination of topological properties in an efficient manner with high fidelity.</s>
