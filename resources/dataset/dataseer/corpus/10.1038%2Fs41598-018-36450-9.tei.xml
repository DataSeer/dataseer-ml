          <s>Compared with E3, E2 and E4 isoforms have been discovered to have altered functionalities in promoting clearance of triglyceride (TG) rich lipoproteins from plasma <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>

          <s>The reported prevalence of different alleles within human population is by average: ε2/7%, ε3/78% and ε4/14% 6 .</s>
          <s>The associations of ε4 with elevated serum total cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C) values have been recognized for a long time <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> and the allele ε4 has been linked to the risk of atherosclerosis <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> and CAD, whereas ε2 has been shown to e.g., reduce carotid artery intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcification <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>

          <s>Our study has several important strengths.</s>
          <s>There are no prior systematic studies on the effect of apoE polymorphism on serum metabolome, most studies having limited to standard lipid panels.</s>
          <s>Moreover, earlier apoE studies have not implemented the NMR-method, which allows more detailed analyses and better resolution to compare different subgroups -especially important in distinguishing variations already prior to diagnosed disorders.</s>
          <s>In addition, our longitudinal follow-up with a continuously high participation rate revealed statistically consistent patterns evident within clusters of interlinked metabolic measures, significantly limiting the likelihood of mere isolated random positive hits.</s>
          <s>Also, the comprehensive background information gathered from our cohort allowed a thorough analysis and consideration of the most expected confounding factors.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, our analyses reflect genotype-related differences in a basically healthy general population -avoiding confounding/confusing expressions of illnesses expected when using morbid study subjects.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We also acknowledge certain limitations in our study.</s>
          <s>As previously reported in Finnish general population 7,13 , subgroups of apoE ε2/2, ε4/2, as well as ε4/4 were small also in our population-based setting and did not allow complete analyses of all the six genotypes separately.</s>
          <s>And although our cohort was not small by any means, its size may still have limited a completely comprehensive comparison between (sex-stratified) men and women, as more statistical power may be needed to distinguish all the small, emerging metabolic differences -nevertheless, the absence of apoE x sex interactions was confirmed in the analyses of all subjects.</s>
          <s>Finally, dietary fat intake, the rate of which was uncontrolled during our standard follow-up, has been reported to influence the magnitude of the observed exposure to apoE genotypes 54 , e.g., by altering the LDL-receptor binding of the E4 isoform 55 -thus, generally lower levels of SFA intake within study subjects may possibly lead to smaller apoE genotype-related differences in serum metabolic measures.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, based on reference studies (e.g.</s>

            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">54</ref> ) these recognized limitations do not alter the effect directions related to different apoE alleles, and are thus less likely to have a major impact on our main discoveries presented and discussed here.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, based on a thorough NMR quantification of serum metabolome apoE polymorphism is associated with a complex metabolic change, including aberrations in multiple new biomarkers related to elevated cardiometabolic and all-cause mortality risk, extending our understanding about the role of apoE in health and disease.</s>
          <s>These changes are already evident in a basically healthy general population.</s>
          <s>For further work, the associations of more specifically quantified serum lipidomics data should also be analysed over the apoE genotypes, as certain TGs, cholesterol esters, PGs (phosphatidylethanolamines) and sphingomyelins (ceramides) have presented the strongest found novel associations with increased risk of CAD 14,56 -in our study, elevated associations of all these lipid groups can be detected also in the apoE ε4+ subgroup (lowered in the ε2+ subgroup), and it is well expected to reveal more common nominators in the reported pool of novel risk markers.</s>
          <s>The relationship between the current new metabolic findings and pathogenesis, as well as different clinical manifestations should also be investigated using e.g., metabolic pathway analysis approach.</s>
