            <s>Previous studies have shown that face stimuli elicit extremely fast and involuntary saccadic responses toward them, relative to other categories of visual stimuli.</s>
            <s>In the present study, we further investigated to what extent face stimuli influence the programming and execution of saccades examining their amplitude.</s>
            <s>We performed two experiments using a saccadic choice task: two images (one with a face, one with a vehicle) were simultaneously displayed in the left and right visual fields of participants who had to initiate a saccade toward the image (Experiment 1) or toward a cross in the image (Experiment 2) containing a target stimulus (a face or a vehicle).</s>
            <s>Results revealed shorter saccades toward vehicle than face targets, even if participants were explicitly asked to perform their saccades toward a specific location (Experiment 2).</s>
            <s>Furthermore, error saccades had smaller amplitude than correct saccades.</s>
            <s>Further analyses showed that error saccades were interrupted in mid-flight to initiate a concurrentlyprogrammed corrective saccade.</s>
            <s>Overall, these data suggest that the content of visual stimuli can influence the programming of saccade amplitude, and that efficient online correction of saccades can be performed during the saccadic choice task.</s>

            <s>Faces are very salient visual stimuli for humans and our visual system has developed efficient mechanisms to preferentially detect and process them.</s>
            <s>A particular status of face stimuli is supported by a large number of studies, which consistently showed that faces elicit fast and characteristic brain and behavioral responses, as compared to other categories of visual stimuli 1-6 .</s>
            <s>Eye-tracking studies for example showed that during free exploration of complex scenes containing faces, observers immediately direct their gaze toward them and spend a lot of the exploration time looking at them 7-11 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Recent studies have adopted a paradigm in which eye movements are used as a behavioral response to investigate the speed of face processing.</s>
            <s>In this paradigm, called saccadic choice task, two images are simultaneously displayed on a screen in the left and right visual fields.</s>
            <s>One image contains a target stimulus (e.g., a face) and the other one a distractor (e.g., a vehicle).</s>
            <s>Participants have to perform a saccade as fast as possible toward the target stimulus (e.g., a face 3,12-15 ).</s>
            <s>Although this task requires multiple processes (i.e.</s>
            <s>simultaneous processing of two images, a categorical decision, programming and execution of an eye movement toward the target), it has been shown that human observers are able to initiate accurate saccadic responses toward a face with extremely short latencies of just 100-110 ms 3 .</s>
            <s>Such latencies are barely above the earliest latencies observed for reflexive saccades elicited by the appearance of an image or a simple dot stimulus in the periphery (see for example 3,15-17 ), highlighting the remarkable speed of face processing.</s>
            <s>Furthermore, these studies also reported that participants made more error saccades (i.e.</s>
            <s>saccades toward the distractor) when the distractor was a face than when it was another stimulus (e.g., a vehicle).</s>
            <s>This suggests that fast saccades toward faces tend to be automatic and can be beyond voluntary control 4,18 , see also <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
            <s>Further studies using the same saccadic choice task revealed that the bias for face stimuli persists even if they are presented at large eccentricities (up to 80Â°) 13 or if stimuli are filtered so that only coarse, low-spatial frequency information remains in the stimulus 14 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Overall, these eye-tracking data suggest that faces contain specific information that influences the programming of saccades by triggering extremely fast and automatic orienting responses toward them.</s>
            <s>However, these studies only focused on the analysis of saccade latency and accuracy.</s>
            <s>These parameters inform about the speed of processes involved in the task and the ability to select (suppress) an appropriate (inappropriate) response, respectively.</s>
            <s>Yet, other saccade parameters would be relevant to further inform about saccade programming.</s>
            <s>For example, studies investigating the programming of saccades also analyzed their precision (i.e. the distance between their ending point and the target point) or their amplitude (i.e. the distance between the starting and ending point Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/</s>

          <s>In the classical view, the amplitude of a saccade is thought to be programmed at its onset and would not be influenced by new visual information once initiated, thereby informing about saccade programming prior to its execution (although small online corrections can be observed based on internal feedbacks <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the absence of a visual distractor, saccades toward a peripheral target stimulus are accurate in terms of spatial precisionalthough it is frequently observed that saccades land between the starting and target position <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>

          <s>However, when a distractor is presented on the saccade trajectory to a target, the saccade tends to land at an intermediate location between the two stimuli.</s>
          <s>More precisely, the saccade would land beyond (overshoot) or in front of (undershoot) the target if the distractor is also presented beyond or before the target, respectively e.g.</s>

            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the landing position of the saccade -toward one stimulus or the other -can be modulated according to stimulus characteristics, such as their size (e.g., saccades tend to land closer to the biggest stimulus <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> ) or task constraints (e.g., saccades tend to land closer to one stimulus if it has been defined as the target but would land in between the two stimuli if there is no specific target to reach <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29 )</ref> .</s>
          <s>This phenomenon, known as 'saccade averaging' , is interpreted as resulting from the weighted average of activity of neurons coding for each stimulus location on a common saccade map.</s>
          <s>These studies thus indicate that the presence and properties of a distractor stimulus can influence the programming of saccade amplitude toward a target.</s>
          <s>However, whether the content of the target and distractor stimuli in the context of a saccadic choice task can also impacts programming of saccade amplitude has, to our knowledge, never been addressed.</s>

          <s>For example, using a visual search task, in which participants were presented with a display of stimuli and had to initiate a saccade toward one of them based on its color, McPeek et al. <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> observed that in a small proportion of trials, participants made error saccades which were characterized by small amplitudes.</s>

          <s>perform a saccade in the direction opposite to the appearance of a target), <ref type="bibr">Weber et al. (1997)</ref> observed that error saccades were often hypometric.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, in these studies, hypometric initial error saccades were generally followed by a second saccade bringing the gaze to the correct target location after a very short delay (0-100 ms), well below the range of normal saccade latencies (120-200 ms).</s>
          <s>These short inter-saccadic intervals between two consecutive saccades were taken as evidence that the programming of the second saccade occurred in parallel and interfered with the initial one, resulting in a reduction of the initial saccade's amplitude <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>These studies led to propose that two saccades oriented toward different goals can be programmed concurrently on a common saccade map and that the different programs would compete with each other.</s>
          <s>The program winning the competition would be executed, but could still be influenced and even curtailed once initiated by a concurrent program, resulting in a reduction of the first saccade amplitude and the execution of a second saccade after a very short delay <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>It is likely that the saccadic choice task also involves parallel programming of two saccades (i.e. one toward each image) competing and interfering with each other.</s>
          <s>The examination of saccade amplitude according to response accuracy, but also of the characteristics (e.g., latency, amplitude) of saccades following an error would thus allow to test this hypothesis.</s>
          <s>Importantly, it would also allow to test for potential differences between parallel programming of saccades according to the content of their target, which has never been investigated so far.</s>
          <s>It is for example possible that a saccade program toward a face stimulus interferes more strongly with a concurrently programmed saccade toward a vehicle than the other way around.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The present study thus aimed to further investigate the extent to which the content of complex visual stimuli, in particular the face content, influence saccade programming and execution.</s>
          <s>To this end, we performed two experiments using a saccadic choice task in which images of faces and vehicles were presented simultaneously to participants in their right and left visual fields.</s>
          <s>In Experiment 1, we used the same saccadic choice task as in previous studies <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>Participants were asked to perform saccades as fast as possible toward the side of the display containing the target stimulus (a face or a vehicle).</s>
          <s>Whereas previous studies only analyzed saccade accuracy and latency, we focused in the present one on the amplitude of saccades, as reflecting an aspect of saccade programming prior to their execution allowing to better understand the mechanisms underlying saccadic choices.</s>
          <s>The amplitude of saccades was analyzed taking into account the target category (face vs. vehicle), and the accuracy of saccadic responses (correct saccades toward the target vs. error saccade toward the distractor).</s>
          <s>In Experiment 2, we used the same design but this time, participants were explicitly asked to perform their saccades toward a fixation cross added in the center of the images.</s>
          <s>This allowed us to better estimate the precision of saccades with respect to the target cross to reach, and thus to quantify how saccade amplitude was modulated by the content of visual stimuli and the accuracy of saccadic responses.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Given previous reports suggesting that face stimuli elicit fast and involuntary saccades toward them, we expected that the presence of a face distractor would also impact amplitude of saccades directed toward another target stimulus.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, based on previous findings (e.g., McPeek et al. <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> , we expected error saccades to be shorter than correct saccades, suggesting their modulation by a concurrently programmed corrective saccade.</s>
          <s>Finally, we examined the possibility that concurrent programming of saccades was also influenced by the content of their targets.</s>

          <s>In this case, its programming and hence its amplitude should compensate for the fact that the first saccade brought the eyes away from the target.</s>
          <s>This would be reflected by a positive correlation between the amplitudes of the error and corrective saccades.</s>

          <s>Analysis of saccade kinematics.</s>
          <s>The previous analyses revealed that error saccades were hypometric relative to correct saccades, and followed by corrective saccades with very short latencies, suggesting their programming occurred in parallel with the first saccade.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, these analyses showed that the amplitude of saccades following an error increased with the amplitude of the error, suggesting that they were programmed to compensate for the error.</s>
          <s>We thus further tested whether the corrective saccade could also have interrupted the initial error one, which could explain the reduced amplitude of error relative to correct saccades.</s>
          <s>To this end, we examined saccades kinematics.</s>
          <s>Saccade kinematics are known to follow regularities characterized by an increase of peak speed with increasing amplitude of saccade.</s>
          <s>The relation between peak speed and saccade amplitude has been called the main sequence <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">42</ref> .</s>
          <s>Simple two-parameter functions have been proposed to model the main sequence.</s>
          <s>If a saccade programmed to achieve a certain amplitude is interrupted in mid-flight, its kinematics should exhibit a violation of the main sequence, with a higher peak speed than the one predicted by its main sequence for a particular amplitude <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43</ref> .</s>
          <s>In order to address this question, we first extracted the main sequence (i.e.</s>
          <s>peak speed as a function of saccade amplitude) of correct saccades for each participant.</s>
          <s>We then compared the peak speed observed for error saccades to the peak speed predicted by the main sequence of correct saccade, given the saccade amplitude (see <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref> and <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Predicted peak speed was calculated as follows: an exponential function was fitted (using EzyFit toolbox; Moisy, F http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/ezyfit/</s>

          <s>For each participant, a classical least-square fitting procedure was used to estimate the two parameters (mean RÂ² = 0.69, SD = 0.21).</s>
          <s>For each trial, the 2-parameters function was used to estimate the predicted peak speed based on the saccade amplitude observed at this trial.</s>
          <s>This predicted peak speed was then used to normalize the observed peak speed of correct saccades and of error saccades followed by a corrective saccade (see Buonocore et al. <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43</ref> for a similar procedure).</s>
          <s>Normalized peak speed higher than 1 indicates higher peak speed than what is predicted by the observed amplitude.</s>

          <s>It should be noted that two subjects were excluded from this analysis due to aberrant fit parameters leading to biased estimation of predicted peak speed.</s>
          <s>Results revealed a main effect of Saccade Accuracy (F 1,21 = 6.09, p &lt; 0.05, Î· p 2 = 0.225), suggesting a violation of the main sequence for error saccades: normalized peak speed of error saccades (1.08 Â± 0.13) were higher than that of correct saccades (1.04 Â± 0.07).</s>

          <s>Importantly, our results additionally revealed that saccades toward faces were also larger than saccades toward vehicles.</s>
          <s>As the position of target stimuli within the images was controlled for and given that all images were presented once in each visual field, this result cannot be explained by an overall larger eccentricity of faces relative to vehicles in the images.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the average amplitude of correct saccades toward faces (6.66Â°) did not exceed the distance between the central fixation point and the center of lateral images (set at 7.6Â° of eccentricity), suggesting that they were not abnormally large but rather that saccades toward vehicles (mean amplitude: 6Â°) were short.</s>
          <s>This is illustrated in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref> in which the mean ending points of saccades on the display are plotted for all participants.</s>
          <s>This result therefore suggests that the content of the target/distractor image influences programming of saccade amplitude in the saccadic choice task.</s>
          <s>However, as the task did not involve any constraint on the ending point of saccades (i.e.</s>
          <s>participants were asked to perform a saccade "toward the image containing the target" and not toward a particular location in this image), the extent to which saccade amplitude is affected by the content of the target/distractor stimulus could not be precisely estimated.</s>
          <s>Indeed, it has been shown that when participant freely explore complex scenes containing faces, they preferentially look at them and tend to fixate at their center <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, when faces are absent, the location of fixations is rather predicted by low-level salient features within the image <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is thus possible that when the target was a face, participants preferentially directed their saccade toward the center of the face, whereas they did not necessarily reach the center of vehicles in images when this stimulus was defined as the target and ended their saccades before.</s>
          <s>Another interesting finding of Experiment 1 was that amplitude of saccade was also modulated by the accuracy of the saccadic response, error saccades being much shorter than correct saccades (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2b,c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, these hypometric error saccades were generally followed by a second saccade bringing the gaze to the target image with extremely short inter-saccadic intervals from just 20 ms.</s>
          <s>This pattern of results was previously observed in eye-tracking studies involving a saccadic response such as visual search tasks, anti-saccade tasks or double-step paradigms <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> .</s>
          <s>They were taken as evidence that the programming of two saccades occurred in parallel and that the development of the second saccade program could curtail or even interrupt the initial one, resulting in a smaller amplitude.</s>
          <s>In order to disambiguate this question, we examined the kinematics of saccades, which revealed that error saccades deviated from the main sequence of correct saccades, with higher peak speed than what was predicted by their amplitude.</s>
          <s>This latter result thus rather supports the idea that error saccades were interrupted by the development and execution of a concurrent saccade program toward the target image.</s>
          <s>Critically, the amplitude of error saccades was also modulated by the content of their target, error saccades directed toward vehicle distractors being even shorter than error saccades directed toward face distractors.</s>
          <s>This could thus indicate that when an initial error saccade was made toward a distractor stimulus, the programming of a corrective saccade toward a face developed and interrupted the initially executed saccade earlier than corrective saccades toward a vehicle.</s>
          <s>However, we did not find evidence for a difference in the corrective saccade parameters according to the content of their target.</s>
          <s>Importantly, analyses of the amplitude of error and corrective saccades indicated that the amplitude of saccades following an error increased with the amplitude of the error.</s>
          <s>This suggests that they were programmed to compensate for the error saccade amplitude while it was being executed.</s>
          <s>However, as the task did not involve a specific location to reach that could serve as basis to estimate the precision of the corrective saccade, this question could not be further addressed in the present experiment.</s>
          <s>Experiment 2 was thus designed to disambiguate the extent to which saccade amplitude was affected by the content of the target and distractor stimuli, as well as the extent to which saccades following an error compensated for the amplitude of the error, by constraining the ending location of saccadic responses.</s>
          <s>Design and procedure were the same as in Experiment 1 with the difference that this time, a white cross was added in the center of each image and participants were asked to perform their saccades toward the white cross in the center of the lateral image containing the target stimulus.</s>

          <s>Furthermore, hypometria observed for correct saccades toward vehicles, relative to faces was not observed for corrective saccades.</s>
          <s>These results therefore suggest that saccades following an error were programmed to compensate for the amplitude of error and were no longer influenced by the content of the target/distractor images.</s>

          <s>As the only difference between Experiment 1 and 2 was that Experiment 2 required the programming of the saccade endpoint in addition to saccade direction, the mean difference between saccade latencies in the two experiments therefore suggests that the programming of saccade endpoint, relative to the programming of its direction only, comes with a processing cost that takes about 20 ms.</s>

          <s>Critically, the examination of saccade amplitude during this task additionally revealed two new main findings.</s>
          <s>First, we observed that amplitude of saccades was modulated by the content of the target/distractor stimuli: Saccades toward vehicles (faces as distractor) were shorter than saccades toward faces (vehicle as distractor).</s>
          <s>Second, we observed that error saccades were shorter than correct saccades suggesting their interruption to initiate a corrective saccade.</s>
          <s>In the following, we discuss the significance of these results and their potential underlying neural mechanisms, as well as their implication for studies on eye movements.</s>
          <s>Saccade amplitude is modulated by the content of the stimuli.</s>
          <s>Throughout two experiments, we consistently observed that saccades toward faces were larger than saccades toward vehicles.</s>
          <s>This effect persisted even if participants were explicitly required to perform their saccades toward a specific location within the images (Experiment 2) indicating it could not be voluntarily controlled.</s>
          <s>Results of Experiment 2 revealed that all saccades actually tended to undershoot the target point, but to a greater extent when they were directed toward vehicle than face stimuli, suggesting that saccades toward vehicles were rather hypometric relative to saccades toward faces.</s>
          <s>These results therefore indicate that the content of visual stimuli influences the programming of saccade amplitude in a saccadic choice task.</s>
          <s>Previous studies proposed that when a task involves multiple potential targets (e.g., as in saccadic choice task or visual search task) or the potential execution of eye movements toward different locations (e.g., as in the anti-saccade task), saccade programs oriented toward these different goals could be developed in parallel and compete with each other through mutual inhibition on a common saccade map representing the location of the saccadic goals <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>However, if a competing program develops fast enough, it might still influence and interfere with the programming and execution of the winning program.</s>
          <s>This would arise through increased activity of neurons coding for the alternative saccade goal, thereby weakening activity of neurons coding for the goal of the winning program <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49</ref> , resulting in the reduced amplitude of the executed saccade <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>Within this framework, the general undershoot observed for correct saccades could be interpreted as resulting from the interfering influence of a competing saccade program directed toward the distractor image.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In our saccadic choice task, the face and vehicle images were displayed simultaneously on the left and right visual fields, thus involving the generation of two potential saccade programs, toward the left and right crosses, interfering with each other.</s>
          <s>Critically, the fact that saccades toward vehicles were even shorter than saccades toward faces suggests that (1) the content of the images played a critical role in these competitive interactions and (2) the saccade program toward a face stimulus interfered more strongly (through greater weight/stronger inhibition) with the saccade program toward a vehicle stimulus than the other way around.</s>
          <s>A greater weight of saccade programs toward face stimuli would also be consistent with the higher error rate of saccadic responses toward face than vehicle distractors observed in both experiments, suggesting that the saccade program toward faces actually won the competition in a substantial amount of trials.</s>

          <s>Overall, our results therefore suggest for the first time that the characteristics of visual stimuli, such as their behavioral relevance can come into play in the interactions underlying the parallel programming of saccades, by modulating the relative weight of competing programs for saccade target selection.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recent studies suggested that this bias for face stimuli could be mediated by rapid processing of visual information via a subcortical retino-tectal pathway, through which part of visual information exiting ganglion retinal cells directly projects to the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (sSC) before reaching the pulvinar and the amygdala 53-56 .</s>
          <s>Nakano et al. <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">53</ref> for example argued that the speed of processing along in the main retino-geniculo-cortical pathway (the earliest visual response latencies observed in human visual cortical areas are of 56 ms in V1, and 70-80 ms in V3 and V4 57 cited in <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">53</ref> , together with the time required to generate a saccade <ref type="bibr">(20-30 ms)</ref> is too slow to account for the fast saccadic responses toward faces in just 100-110 ms, as previously observed by Crouzet et al. <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> However, electrophysiological recordings in monkeys <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">54,</ref>
            <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">56</ref> showed that neurons in the sSC and in the pulvinar exhibit distinct response to face-like stimuli within the first 25 ms and 50 ms following stimulus onset, respectively.</s>
          <s>As the pulvinar directly projects to the lateral intraparietal cortex, involved in saccade generation with latencies of 30 ms, such timings would be more compatible with the speed of face processing previously observed.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the retino-tectal pathway is thought to be particularly involved in the detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli such as faces See for a review <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">55</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, exactly how fast detection of faces via the sSC in turn modulates the weight of a saccade program toward this stimulus in the iSC remains to be addressed.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another remaining question pertains to the nature of visual information rapidly extracted from face stimuli which could underlie these effects.</s>
          <s>In a recent study, Guyader et al. <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> examined the role of low-level properties of stimuli such as color and spatial frequencies for fast detection of faces during a saccadic choice task.</s>
          <s>In this study, stimuli were either colored, gray-scaled, filtered in low spatial frequencies or in high spatial frequencies.</s>
          <s>They observed faster saccadic reaction times (SRTs) toward face than other target categories in all viewing conditions, but SRTs toward face targets were faster when the images were unfiltered (colored and grey-scaled) and filtered in LSF than when they were filtered in HSF.</s>
          <s>These results suggested that rapid detection of faces could be partly mediated by fast processing of their LSF content.</s>
          <s>However, previous research supports the idea that the bias for faces during saccade programming cannot be totally accounted for by low-level properties of visual stimuli.</s>
          <s>For example, using an anti-saccade task, a couple of studies showed that participants made more errors and were slower when they had to perform saccades in the direction opposite to upright faces than to inverted faces 18 or phase-scrambled versions of faces 4 sharing the same low-level properties.</s>
          <s>These results therefore additionally suggest that the orienting bias toward faces rather reflects an influence of high-level processing on saccade programming.</s>
          <s>Further studies manipulating both low-and high-level properties of stimuli during a saccadic choice task would be needed to disambiguate that question.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It should be noted that we cannot totally rule out that the difference in saccade amplitude toward faces and vehicles simply results from a general tendency to make larger saccades toward faces than vehicles, irrespective of the presence of a distractor or a concurrent saccade program.</s>
          <s>Indeed, results of a control experiment (see Supplementary Data) in which participants had to perform a saccade toward a central cross in a face or vehicle image displayed without a distractor suggested that saccades toward faces are still slightly but significantly larger than saccades toward vehicles, albeit to a lesser degree than what was observed in our Experiments.</s>
          <s>This therefore further supports the idea of an influence of stimulus processing on saccade programming.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, this bias appeared to be abolished under particular circumstances as we observed that corrective saccades following an error could reach the target, with no significant difference according to the content of the target stimulus.</s>
          <s>This indicates that participants were in some cases able to perform spatially accurate saccades toward the target point, irrespective of the image contents.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, this suggests that after an error saccade toward the distractor was inhibited, saccade toward target were no longer interfered and could reach the target point with high precision (see also our discussion below).</s>

          <s>Second, these error saccades were followed in the large majority of trials by a second corrective saccade bringing the gaze to the target location after a very short delay (median &lt; 100 ms), well below the range of saccade latencies observed for the first correct and error saccades (median around 200 ms).</s>
          <s>Such extremely short inter-saccadic intervals were previously reported in studies involving the execution of two consecutive saccades and were taken as evidence that the programming of the second saccade occurred in parallel to the execution of the initial one <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>At the neurobiological level, this would translate into a rise in activity of neurons in the iSC and frontal eye fields coding for the second saccade goal, while (or even before) the first saccade is being executed <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36,</ref>

          <s>Finally, the examination of saccade kinematics revealed that, on average, error saccades deviated from the main sequence of correct saccades, with higher peak velocities than what was predicted from the observed amplitude.</s>
          <s>Overall, these results suggest that error saccades toward a distractor image were interrupted while they were being executed, to initiate a concurrently-programmed corrective saccade toward the target.</s>
          <s>Only a few studies have reported mid-flight interruption of saccades, in which the brief appearance of a distractor (e.g., a flash) resulted in hypometric saccades toward a target, with abnormal speed profiles given their amplitude <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43,</ref>
            <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">61</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the interruption of an erroneous saccadic response to initiate a corrective saccade in a different direction has, to our knowledge, not been reported.</s>
          <s>For example, using a visual search task, McPeek et al. <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> observed that, although error saccades were hypometric and followed by concurrently programmed corrective saccades, they did not deviate from the main sequence and were interpreted as reflecting diminished neural activity corresponding to the first saccade goal, due to the competing saccade program toward the second goal.</s>
          <s>It should however be noted that in most studies reporting hypometric error saccades associated with short-latency corrective saccade, kinematics of error saccades were not examined e.g.</s>
          <s>

            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, whether mid-flight interruption of error saccades occurred in these studies could not be addressed.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, the fact that error saccades toward vehicle distractors were even shorter than error saccades toward face distractors suggests their interruption occurred earlier when a concurrent saccade was programmed toward a face than toward a vehicle stimulus, respectively.</s>
          <s>In that sense, results on error saccades support the above-mentioned assumption of a greater weight for saccade programs directed toward faces to interrupt a saccade program toward another stimulus.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, the examination of concurrently-programmed saccades following an error revealed that they compensated for the amplitude of the initial error saccade and reached the target location, irrespective of the content of stimuli.</s>
          <s>This contrasts with the relatively lower precision of correct saccades, which were found to systematically undershoot the target and to a higher degree when it was a vehicle.</s>
          <s>We previously proposed that undershoot of correct saccades could be explained by the influence of the distractor image on the programming of saccade toward the target.</s>
          <s>In this context, the higher gain of corrective saccades suggests that after the interruption of an error saccade program, this program did no longer influence the amplitude of the concurrently-programmed corrective saccade toward the target.</s>
          <s>It is generally agreed that sensitivity to visual information is reduced and non-motion information suppressed while a saccade is being performed <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[62]</ref>
            <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[63]</ref>
            <ref target="#b64" type="bibr">[64]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the relative distance to the target could not be computed based on visual information during the execution of the initial error saccade.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the latencies of corrective saccades were too short to allow (1) the computation of the target's distance based on the new eye position and (2) the programming of a saccade toward it.</s>
          <s>Therefore, it can be assumed that the target location, relative to the eye position, was computed before the initiation of the first error saccade (i.e. while fixating on the central cross) and was updated at the end of the error saccade.</s>
          <s>This proposal is supported by neurophysiological and behavioral studies showing that the oculomotor system generates predictions based on pre-saccadic information, in order to facilitate processing of post-saccadic information <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>Overall, the data obtained in the present study point to the ability for the oculomotor system to efficiently perform an online correction of saccadic response, through the development of a saccade program while a first erroneous saccade is being executed, resulting in its interruption, and then the execution of an accurate saccade toward the target.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the notion of 'correction' does not necessarily imply that participants were aware of an error and voluntarily corrected for it.</s>
          <s>On the contrary, a couple of studies indicated that hypometric error saccades followed by short-latency corrective saccades were more likely to be observed when participants were unaware of the initial error <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47,</ref>

        <p>
          <s>The present study provides new insights on the interactions between the oculomotor system and the properties of visual stimuli, by showing for the first time that the programming of saccades during a saccadic choice task is influenced by the content of the saccadic goal(s).</s>
          <s>These findings further support previous studies showing that faces constitute particular stimuli for the visual system and elicit characteristic behavioral responses, relative to other categories of visual stimuli.</s>
          <s>Additionally, analysis of saccade amplitude and saccade kinematics in the present study allowed us to further precise the processes at hand during the saccadic choice task, by showing that efficient online correction of error saccades can occur at least during this task.</s>
          <s>Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of using ecological and behaviorally-relevant stimuli but also the relevance of examining oculomotor parameters such as saccade amplitude to better characterize and understand the functioning of the visual and oculomotor systems.</s>
