            <s>Background: Emergency contraception, if used properly, can prevent up to over 95 % of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies.</s>
            <s>However, a number of obstacle including healthcare providers knowledge, perception, and attitude towards emergency contraception (EC) prevent women and adolescents from having access to EC. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among 191 female final year nursing and midwifery students of Tamale Nurses and Midwives Training College in the Northern Region of Ghana.</s>
            <s>Purposive sampling method was used to sample 100 students from the nursing programme and 91 from the midwifery programme.</s>
            <s>Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed to determine factors associated with awareness about EC and use of EC.</s>
            <s>Results: Over four-fifths, 166(86.91%), of the participants indicated they had heard about EC prior to the study.</s>
            <s>Majority (80.10%) of the participants correctly indicated the time within which to take emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).</s>
            <s>More than half, 105(54.97%), of the participants did not know the appropriate time within which to use IUD as EC.</s>
            <s>Almost four-fifths, 74(38.74%), of the participants indicated it is morally wrong to use EC and more than half, (n = 104, 54.45%), of them said EC use promotes promiscuity.</s>
            <s>Only 49(25.65%)</s>
            <s>participants said they had ever used ECP.</s>
            <s>Of the number that indicated ever-using ECP, 36(73.47%)</s>
            <s>cited condom breakage or slippage as the reason for using the method.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: Though there was a relatively high level of EC awareness and knowledge among the students, some students lacked detailed knowledge about the method, especially the use of IUD as EC.</s>
            <s>We found that it was easy to access EC in the study area but the use of EC was low among the students.</s>
            <s>Most of the students demonstrated a positive attitude towards EC, but many of them believed EC encourages promiscuous sexual behaviour and that it is morally wrong to use EC.</s>
            <s>The curriculum for nursing and midwifery education should provide opportunity for detailed information and practical knowledge on EC to demystify negative perceptions and attitudes of nursing and midwifery students towards EC and other forms of contraception and to improve their knowledge on EC.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Every woman and adolescent has the right to decide freely when to have children, how many, and with whom.</s>
          <s>These rights are upheld with emergency contraception (EC) in cases of unprotected intercourse, contraceptive failure, incorrect use of contraceptives, and coerced sex.</s>
          <s>Emergency contraception provides women and adolescents with a second opportunity to prevent an unplanned or mistimed pregnancy within three to five days of unprotected sexual intercourse by preventing or temporarily stopping ovulation or by causing a chemical change in sperm and egg before they meet <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It ensures women and girls are able to circumvent the socioeconomic and negative health outcomes of unplanned and unintended pregnancy <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Access to EC is particularly important for young women who are vulnerable to sexual abuse and often lack the skills and power to negotiate use of a condom <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>According to the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), 30% of married women in Ghana had an unmet need for family planning services, with 17% having an unmet need for spacing and 13% having an unmet need for limiting.</s>
          <s>Largely, Ghanaian women had 0.6 children more than their ideal number of 3.6 children.</s>
          <s>This suggests that the total fertility rate (TFR) was 17% more than it would have been if unwanted births were avoided <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Unwanted pregnancies often lead to abortions performed in unsafe environments with complications such as haemorrhage, infections, infertility, or even death <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Emergency contraception, if used properly, can prevent up to over 95 % of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies.</s>
          <s>Copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs) and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are the two types of emergency contraception currently available for use.</s>
          <s>A Copper-bearing IUD is more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sexual intercourse.</s>
          <s>Emergency contraceptive pills include progesterone only pills and combined oral contraceptive pills and are more effective between 72 and 120 h of unprotected intercourse <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Ghana, emergency contraceptive pills such as postinor-2, Lydia post pill, NorLevo, and pregnon are available in pharmacist, family planning clinics and can be procured without a medical prescription.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, a number of obstacle including healthcare providers knowledge, perception, and attitude towards EC prevent women and adolescents from having access to EC <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Many women and adolescents are reluctant to purchase EC because of the negative attitude and perception of healthcare providers (nurses and midwives) about EC.</s>
          <s>Yet, since the inclusion of EC in the National Reproductive Health Service Policy and Standards by the ministry health in Ghana <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , limited studies have been conducted on the knowledge, attitude, and use of EC among female nursing and midwifery students in Northern Ghana.</s>
          <s>In view of that, this study was undertaken to assess the knowledge, awareness, attitude, and use of EC and to determine the association between these factors and the socio-demographic characteristics of female nursing and midwifery students of Tamale Nurses and Midwives Training College in Northern Ghana.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>It is evident from our findings that there is a high level of awareness of EC among the participants.</s>
          <s>This is comparable to findings of several studies <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Further, the students had good knowledge about emergency contraception.</s>
          <s>This is understandable considering the fact that family planning is a major part of the curriculum for both the nursing and midwifery programmes.</s>
          <s>A higher knowledge about EC will build up their capacity to provide accurate and effective information on EC to prevent unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.</s>
          <s>Similar studies in Korea and America found a significantly higher knowledge of ECPs among participants who had received education and formal content on EC <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite the good knowledge, more than half of the students did not know IUD could prevent unwanted pregnancy beyond 72 h of unprotected sexual intercourse, which is consistent with a previous study among nurse practitioner students <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This is worrying, given that women seeking to use IUD depend on healthcare providers for information.</s>
          <s>Lack of knowledge of the correct period to use IUD may affect the accuracy of information provided by these future nurses and midwives to women seeking to use IUD as EC and could lead to underutilisation of the method.</s>
          <s>This underscores the need to broaden and provide detail education on family planning, especially EC, in Nursing and Midwifery Training Schools.</s>
          <s>It was disturbing to find that the student nurses and midwives believed EC use encourages casual and indiscriminate sexual intercourse, which contradicts the findings of Sorhaindo et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> but confirms those of Celik et al. <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Available literature does not support the argument that EC use promotes unprotected sexual intercourse or discourage use of other methods of contraception.</s>
          <s>This highlights the need to intensify education campaigns targeted at demystifying negative perceptions and attitudes towards EC and other forms of contraception.</s>
          <s>More of a concern is the fact that about one-third of the students incorrectly believed it is morally wrong to use EC.</s>
          <s>These findings are worrying given that the participants were final year students who will soon graduate to provide healthcare services including family planning and contraception services to women and adolescents.</s>
          <s>The reported perception may possibly affect their attitude towards the delivery of information about EC and counselling of women seeking to use EC and perhaps other methods of contraception.</s>
          <s>However, when Delaram and Rafie <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref> surveyed medical students in Iran they found that the majority of the students did not agree it was unethical to use EC and 43% of them disagreed that EC use will lead to irresponsible sexual behaviour <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, Celik et al. reported 61% disagreement with the perception that ECPs use is unethical when they surveyed nursing students in Turkey <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The varying findings may be due to the difference in study settings as the Iranian and Turkish studies were conducted among university students who may have received a higher content on family planning compared with the college students in our study.</s>
          <s>All women and girls at risk of an unintended pregnancy have a right to access emergency contraception.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, evidence suggests that ECPs use is safe and the side effects associated with its use are similar to those of oral contraceptive pills, and will normally resolve without further medications <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the current study, the majority of the students agreed that correct use of EC is safe and that it is easy to access EC in the study area.</s>
          <s>This suggests that the students could easily procure EC to prevent an unplanned pregnancy in case of unprotected sexual intercourse.</s>
          <s>In line with our findings, Kang and Moneyham reported easy accessibility of EC as the highest scored attitude of college students towards EC in America <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>EC disrupts ovulation and reduces the likelihood of pregnancy.</s>
          <s>It cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg, harm a developing embryo, or end a pregnancy (UNFPA 2013).</s>
          <s>Nonetheless, a little over one-fourth (28.8%) of the students in this study wrongly agreed EC is an abortifacient which agrees well with the findings of Lee et al. <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> in America but higher than those of Delaram and Rafie <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref> in Iran.</s>
          <s>In the American study, 27% of the sample believed EC have a similar mechanism of action as mifepristone (an abortifacient), and 10% inaccurately believed EC interrupts pregnancy <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This misconception needs to be corrected if we are to reduce the rate of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies because nurses and midwives with this perception are less likely to accurately advise and educate women seeking to use EC.</s>
        </p>

          <s>There is no age limit or absolute medical contraindications to the use of EC (WHO 2018).</s>
          <s>Access to EC is especially important for adolescents who often lack the skills or power to negotiate condom use and are vulnerable to sexual exploitation <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the current study, more than half of the students agreed that unmarried adolescents could use EC.</s>
          <s>Our finding contradicts what was reported by Celik et al. <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Generally, use of EC was low among the participants in this study.</s>
          <s>This suggests that the participants either use other forms of contraception or are not engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse since only 8% of them were married.</s>
          <s>Most of those who indicated they had ever used EC cited condom breakage or slippage as the reason for using EC, which is comparable to what was found in Jamaica <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This highlights the need for further education on how to properly use and dispose of condoms.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Though there was a relatively high level of EC awareness and knowledge among the students, some students lacked in-depth knowledge about the method, especially the use of IUD.</s>
          <s>We found that it was easy to access EC in the study area but the use of EC was low among the students.</s>
          <s>Most of the students demonstrated a positive attitude towards EC, but many of them believed EC encourages promiscuous sexual behaviour and that it is morally wrong to use EC.</s>
          <s>The curriculum for nursing and midwifery education should provide opportunity for detailed information and practical knowledge on EC to demystify negative perceptions and attitudes of nursing and midwifery students towards EC and other forms of contraception and to improve their knowledge on EC.</s>
