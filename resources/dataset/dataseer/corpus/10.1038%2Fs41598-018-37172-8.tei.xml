          <s>The nanowires form on the surface at temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 700 °C.</s>
          <s>Typically, higher temperatures lead to an increase in diameter, while longer growing times lead to an increase in aspect ratio <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>The formation of the nanowires is connected to the two stable oxides of copper <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> , namely cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) and cupric oxide (CuO).</s>
          <s>The copper surface is oxidied at 70-110 °C forming a layer of Cu 2 O or its defect structure Cu 3 O 2 <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> and the crystallites in the Cu 2 O layer are also larger than those in the CuO one <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>Crystal size of Cu and its oxides is, however, of great importance for the growth of the nanowires, which can form on top of CuO crystallites.</s>
          <s>In order to grow, copper atoms have to migrate through the two oxide films and up the nanowires.</s>
          <s>Grain boundary diffusion is considered to be the dominating contribution to this mass flow, followed by surface diffusion once the surface between the CuO grains have been reached <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, a larger number of grain boundaries leads to increased diffusion and therefore to better growth of the nanowires.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The metallic copper underneath can affect the growth of the nanowires indirectly.</s>
          <s>The increase in volume during oxidation and the corresponding lattice mismatch of the two phases leads to stresses at the copper-Cu 2 O interface.</s>
          <s>The different thermal expansion of a substrate and a copper film can also induce stresses which influence nanowire growth <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been shown that bending of copper foils leads to larger oxide grains at the compressed side and smaller on the tensile side.</s>
          <s>This reduces nanowire growth at the side of compressive stress and promotes it at the side of tensile stress <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, increasing the surface roughness of the copper substrate leads to the nucleation of more grains, which becomes manifest in an increased number of nanowires on such a surface <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> .</s>
          <s>The aim of this work is to further elucidate the influence of the Cu substrate microstructure on the growth of cupric oxide nanowires by thermal oxidation.</s>
          <s>Therefore, three different Cu surfaces are investigated in terms of nanowire growth, namely a copper foil and two Cu films, evaporated and sputtered on silicon wafers.</s>
          <s>The motivation was to elucidate the growth process and microstructure of CuO nanowires on surfaces, which are commonly used in sensor applications.</s>

          <s>These affect mainly the contributions normal to the surface and require an exact knowledge of the incidence angle for a correct description.</s>

          <s>This might change the aforementioned interferences and thereby inhibits the reliable use of the vertical components of the scattering patterns.</s>

          <s>It corresponds to an accessible minimum size of 1.5 nm <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">38</ref> , while the largest detectable sizes are on the order of 32 nm up to 80 nm depending on the minimum q-value.</s>

          <s>However, such an extrapolation would be needed in order to compute and interpret L c truly as the correlation length as introduced by Porod.</s>
          <s>Therefore, an increase and decrease of the parameter L c can only be treated as an indication for changing feature sizes at the surface, while its value cannot be directly linked to a typical structure size.</s>

          <s>As stated above, a fractal surface leads to a power law slope of -(6-D), where D is the surface fractal dimension.</s>
          <s>Given the fact that different types of structures are present, the observed slope could be caused by a combination of both power law behaviours.</s>
          <s>A steeper slope may indicate a more compact structure in terms of mass fractal or a smoother surface in terms of surface fractal.</s>

          <s>The loose layer of short nanowires found on the vapour deposited surface should lead to a weak change of the GISAXS signal, which is actually the case.</s>
          <s>However, even these few nanowires have a diameter that is at least on the same order of magnitude, like in the other cases.</s>
          <s>Therefore, one might ask, why the parameter L c , which is related to the average size of the structures, increases only by such a small amount.</s>
          <s>The fact that one obtains a finite value even without the presence of nanowires at lower temperatures proves that other structures like the grains at the surface influence the result.</s>

          <s>This consequently leads to enhanced CuO nanowire growth <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> and is caused by the inhibition of the free diffusion of oxygen, which reduces the probability that an oxygen atom is captured by an already nucleated oxide island.</s>

          <s>Therefore the flux of copper ions should be relatively small leading to a weak growth of nanowires.</s>
          <s>A second factor that could play a role is the influence of the substrate.</s>
          <s>El Mel and co-workers <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">49</ref> found a strong increase in nanowire growth for film thicknesses from 300 nm to 700 nm.</s>
          <s>Similarly Wang and co-workers <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">50</ref> have reported that no nanowires grew on a film of thickness 0.5 µm on a Ti/Si substrate, while growth was observed on a similar film of 1 µm thickness.</s>
          <s>This is likely to be caused by stresses since Chen and co-workers have observed nanowire growth at the edge of a patterned film of 400 nm thickness <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>

          <s>Such stresses are reduced more easily within a film of 750 nm thickness, like in the case of the sputtered surface, than within 550 nm, like in the case of the vapour deposited film.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>The growth of CuO nanowires was investigated on three different Cu surfaces.</s>
          <s>All three types showed a different formation temperature, thickness, lengths morphology and number density.</s>
          <s>The growth of CuO nanowires on different substrates can be explained well by means of grain boundary diffusion of copper.</s>
          <s>A high number of grain boundaries promotes flux as can be seen on the sputtered copper surface and on the copper foil.</s>
          <s>Roughness prevents the formation of larger grains of CuO on the Cu surface and enhances therefore the density of grain boundaries.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Stresses at the copper-cuprous oxide boundary also influences the growth.</s>
          <s>The compressive stresses in the thin film prepared by vapour deposition and within a valley of the copper foil reduce or inhibit nanowire growth.</s>
          <s>The foil sample exhibits the largest grain size of Cu, but also the highest roughness triggering the growth of fine Cu 2 O grains.</s>
          <s>This leads to the formation of many long NW.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The sputtered copper surface, which has a fine grain structure and a significant roughness exhibits the highest number density of nanowires and has also growth at the lowest temperatures.</s>
          <s>The film deposited from evaporated copper, having comparable larger grain size and a lower roughness on the other hand, has the lowest number density of nanowires, and these nanowires grow most slowly.</s>
