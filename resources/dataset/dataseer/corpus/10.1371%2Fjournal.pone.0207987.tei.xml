            <s>Maternal and neonatal outcomes in the immediate post-delivery period are critical indicators of quality of care.</s>
            <s>Data on childbirth outcomes in low-income settings usually require home visits, which can be constrained by cost and access.</s>

            <s>Of women delivering at study sites eligible for inclusion, 97.9% (n = 157,689) consented to follow-up.</s>
            <s>All consenting women delivering at study facilities were eligible to receive a phone call between days eight and 42 post-partum to obtain outcomes for the seven-day period after birth.</s>
            <s>Women unable to be contacted via phone were visited at home.</s>
            <s>Outcomes, including maternal and early neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity, were ascertained using a standardized script developed from validated survey questions.</s>
            <s>Data Quality Assurance (DQA) included accuracy (double coding of calls) and validity (consistency between two calls to the same household).</s>
            <s>Regression models were used to identify factors associated with inconsistency.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This study describes the successful implementation and validation of a call center in ascertaining patient-reported post-discharge outcomes for mothers and their babies in a low-resource, geographically vast setting.</s>
          <s>These findings have the potential to influence how health systems, programs, and research trials gather post-discharge outcomes on patients in regions where cellular coverage is high to inform efforts to improve healthcare access, quality and outcomes for mothers and their newborns.</s>
          <s>Additional work to evaluate the call center method through clinical validation of patient outcomes and the development of simplified assessments/surveys for patient reported outcomes is necessary.</s>
          <s>Acceptable rates of follow-up in epidemiological studies are generally agreed to be 60-80%, however the call center successfully closed 98.0% of eligible cases (87.9% by call center alone), which we believe is largely attributable to three factors <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>First, mobile coverage in the study area is high.</s>
          <s>In February 2016, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India reported a total of 147,772,742 wireless cellular subscribers throughout Uttar Pradesh <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Cell phone coverage is estimated to be 74.0%</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[39]</ref> and is likely much higher.</s>
          <s>While there are still populations with no access to mobile phones or cellular networks, relying on field workers to close the 'harder to reach' cases proved to be an effective alternative method.</s>
          <s>Second, depending on facilitybased study staff to collect consenting mothers' contact information and automating the link between the facilities and the call center ensured that the call center dashboard was routinely updated with the latest information on mothers eligible for follow-up.</s>
          <s>Third, call center staff relied on ASHAs to locate mothers and their families when the mothers were unreachable or the contact number given at the facility was missing or incorrect.</s>
          <s>In these cases, the community-based ASHAs arranged for calls, or field workers were sent to the home to conduct a field worker assisted call.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Despite the eight-fold growth of call center staff over the course of the study to accommodate increasing study enrollment, caller accuracy rates remained consistently high.</s>
          <s>Regular testing and support of callers' work quality was integrated into call center operations through the supportive components of the DQA protocol.</s>
          <s>Real-time reports generated by the call center's dashboard (featuring error incidence by question) enabled supervisors to provide supportive coaching to the callers.</s>
          <s>Given the phase-specific goals for each caller, performance was regularly tested and integrated into call center operations.</s>
          <s>In addition, we adopted core concepts of supportive supervision.</s>
          <s>Accuracy was celebrated, and errors were discussed between caller and supervisor.</s>
          <s>Sources of error were identified from call recordings, and improvement strategies were identified.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Of the total validation sample, 93.7% of cases were perfectly consistent.</s>
          <s>Given limited published data on the validity of call centers for ascertaining patient-reported outcomes in Uttar Pradesh and similar settings, these findings are novel and promising.</s>
          <s>Several factors Evaluation of a call center for childbirth outcomes in Uttar Pradesh, India contributed to the 6.3% of cases, which had at least one inconsistent response between the first and second calls of the validation procedure.</s>
          <s>First, allowing for surrogate respondents on the mother's behalf resulted in higher rates of inconsistency.</s>
          <s>Not surprisingly, our data show that the mother is the preferred respondent when answering questions about her own and her baby's health.</s>
          <s>However, the range of possible barriers to reaching a mother (e.g. the mother has died, she prefers another family member to answer on her behalf) may necessitate seeking alternative sources of information.</s>
          <s>There is considerable evidence demonstrating sole reliance on the birth mother to respond about neonatal mortality may significantly underestimate baby deaths due to the positive correlation between maternal and neonatal deaths <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Questionnaires must be designed to maximize response reliability from multiple respondents.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we attempted to call respondents a second time within seven days of the first call during validation exercises; however, this timing was not always possible due to the high volume of cases.</s>
          <s>Cases with delayed validation were almost twice as likely to demonstrate an inconsistent response on the second call.</s>
          <s>Call-center protocols and validation procedures should consider the timing of calls to limit recall bias.</s>
          <s>Based on the count of cases closed by the call center alone in May 2016 (n = 10,979), we extrapolated the cost if these cases had been closed by a field visit and by a field worker assisted call.</s>
          <s>Contacting mothers only by phone was the least costly follow-up method at $1.09 per case closed, followed by field visits and field worker assisted calls, costing $5.66 and $6.75, respectively.</s>
          <s>In addition to cost differences between the three modes of follow-up, each mode required differing time duration to case closure.</s>
          <s>Though each method only took one attempt, the call center closed cases in a median of three days, whereas it took a median of six days for field workers to close a case.</s>
          <s>We also compared our methods with population health surveys, which are commonly used throughout the world to ascertain maternal and neonatal health data, and are estimated to cost between $7.00 and $104.00 per survey visit <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[41,</ref>
            <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Based on the differential costs of the three methods used in this study as well as comparisons with independent population health surveys, telephonic follow-up may be a less costly option.</s>
          <s>Additionally, accurate recall is a concern with annual population health surveys that target the immediate post-natal period, therefore the call center's validated and timely follow-up suggests cost-effectiveness in terms of data capture <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We did find a small but significant difference in the rates of reported early neonatal mortality ascertained for cases reached by the call center alone versus those for whom a field visit was required.</s>
          <s>The rates were higher for cases unable to be reached by the call center alone.</s>
          <s>A number of factors may have contributed to this difference in early neonatal mortality rates which could include higher prevalence risk factors for early neonatal mortality among families without cell phone access, cellular coverage, or reluctance to report deaths by phone.</s>
          <s>Work is planned to explore the underlying causes of these differences.</s>
          <s>We recommend that implementers collect preliminary data to measure whether outcomes are similar among participants with and without cellular phone or network access.</s>
          <s>For example, home visitation may be necessary if lack of cellular access is found to be associated risk factors related to the health outcome of interest.</s>
          <s>If similar, call center implementers may consider focusing efforts and resources on collecting outcomes directly by phone.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In settings where mobile coverage is high, implementing telephonic follow-up may be a reasonable alternative to solely relying on home visitation for data collection, which historically has been the standard practice for post-delivery outcomes assessment.</s>
          <s>There are considerable limitations to home visitation for large-scale research and implementation projects, especially among geographically dispersed populations.</s>
          <s>First, field workers can only target a limited geographic area and visit a small number of participants per day, potentially resulting in longer time periods between discharge and follow-up, which in our experience is associated with lower rates of consistency.</s>
          <s>Second, supervision to assess data quality is logistically challenging and resource intensive, requiring the supervisor to either observe or revisit the interview.</s>
          <s>Third, in many regions where independent travel by female field workers is not feasible due to safety concerns, the necessary employment of male field workers to ascertain responses to questions about neonatal and maternal complications (a personally and culturally sensitive topic) may compromise the accuracy and reliability of respondents' answers.</s>
          <s>In settings where cellular coverage is low and safety is a concern for female field workers, relying on villagebased female community health workers to collect maternal and early neonatal outcomes may be more reliable and cost-effective <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Telephone-based outcomes assessment is not meant to replace existing home visitation programs.</s>
          <s>This approach, however, could support the growing practice of capturing maternal and neonatal health status after discharge and outcomes auditing, facilitating more timely data capture than population health surveys and better designed for ongoing program improvement <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">45]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are a few limitations to this study.</s>
          <s>We relied on patient or family member report for our post-discharge outcomes and were not able to conduct a clinical verification.</s>
          <s>The accuracy of maternal-reported early neonatal complications can be variable due the type and severity of events, a mother's medical knowledge, and her level of education.</s>
          <s>Research also suggests that parental stress and grief following an infant death can significantly affect their ability to recall details related to the events.</s>
          <s>However, the use of patient reported outcomes to capture adverse events after discharge is a growing standard in many fields, offers insights into patient's experiences and perceptions, but more work is needed to better understand the limitations <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[46]</ref>

          <s>Since we did not clinically validate the outcomes, we did not validate the adaptation of the questions.</s>
          <s>There were also limitations in our validation process.</s>
          <s>We were unable to use the existing gold standard of a field worker home visit to repeat the questionnaire because of safety concerns for female field workers and the reluctance we observed during piloting in reporting some of the morbidities to a male interviewer made this unreliable.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>Our findings, especially given the paucity of neonatal outcomes measurement post-facility discharge in the community setting <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">55]</ref> , demonstrate the promising potential for the use of call centers to collect post-discharge information.</s>
          <s>Our follow-up protocol, combining the efforts of a call center and field workers, achieved an extremely high follow-up rate of 99.7%, resulting in minimal loss-to-follow-up.</s>
          <s>The call center closed an impressive 98.0% of eligible cases, with the vast majority closed by a single call.</s>
          <s>Given the relatively low incidence of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes at the population level, follow-up modalities with limited loss-to-follow-up are essential to ensure accurate reporting and to limit underreporting of events [56].</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our call center was highly effective in ascertaining patient-reported outcomes by successfully following up with the large majority of cases in an under-resourced and geographically vast setting.</s>
          <s>Although clinical validation is needed in future work, the call center demonstrated high accuracy and validity as a follow-up method.</s>
          <s>Remote assessment of patient outcomes by phone offers an exciting and low cost approach for rapidly and reliably assessing outcomes in parts of the world where mobile coverage is high.</s>
