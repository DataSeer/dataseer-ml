            <s>Electrophysiology of excitable cells, such as cardiac myocytes and neurons, has been studied for more than a century using various electrode-based techniques to assess extracellular and transmembrane potentials, ionic currents and currents between two electrically coupled cells.</s>
            <s>However, these approaches are intrinsically limited in their ability to study excitable cells in relation to its surrounding multicellular environment with which it interacts, without compromising the spatial and temporal resolution of the techniques.</s>
            <s>Optical imaging was first developed to study axon electrophysiology as early as 1968 to overcome some of these limitations 1,2 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
            <s>Optical mapping utilizes either intrinsic fluorescent signals or fluorescent dyes that are sensitive to important physiological parameters such as NADH + , transmembrane potential, intracellular calcium concentration, etc., in order to study the related functions of the cell.</s>
            <s>Optical action potentials and NADH were first recorded from the heart in 1976 3,4 .</s>
            <s>The development of ratiometric techniques using BAPTA-based compounds as a fluorescent intracellular calcium indicator allowed for correction of artifacts from bleaching or changes in illumination intensity and focus 5 .</s>
            <s>Over the next decade, progress in optocardiography was due to the development of CCD cameras 6-8 , which allowed dramatic increase in spatial resolution.</s>
            <s>In 1987, two parameters -voltage and NADH + , were recorded from the same heart 9 .</s>
            <s>Later developments in this methodology included increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatiotemporal resolution using tandem lens systems 10 .</s>
            <s>In 1994, the simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium from the same heart was reported 11 .</s>
            <s>Further advancements included the implementation of LED light sources 12 , ratiometric techniques for measuring voltage 13 , panoramic imaging systems 14 , and CMOS cameras 15 .</s>
            <s>A more recent development eliminates the requirement for uncoupling agents by using a motion tracking technique to subtract motion artifact, permitting the study of the relationship between electrical and mechanical activity in intact hearts 16 .</s>

          <s>Due to the complexity and high cost of optical mapping systems, this technique was initially limited to a few laboratories.</s>
          <s>Even though this technology became more easily available in the 1990s, the cost of implementation and experimentation still poses a significant limitation.</s>
          <s>The majority of the price is due to electronic equipment, including illumination sources and photodetectors <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>

          <s>The perfusion lab jack and optical lab jack that support the perfusion and optical components were printed with 27-34 cm and 15-23 cm height ranges, respectively, in order to align the optical and perfusion components during sideways as well as upright imaging.</s>
          <s>Both lab jacks were assembled in six steps <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2a)</ref> , utilizing both a nut-and-bolt and a twist lock mechanism to secure pieces together.</s>

          <s>The lab jacks featured sliding rails on the top plate for securing perfusion and optical components.</s>
          <s>The lab jacks were able to support a load of up to 30 kg.</s>

          <s>The system was assembled in the sideways orientation, where the tilting platform was first secured onto the optical lab jack using sliding rails, followed by the optical components, which were secured onto the upright plate of the tilting platform in the same fashion.</s>
          <s>Next, the upright plate was rotated 90° from the horizontal position and the upright stabilizer was attached to the tilting platform to stabilize the optical components and prevent further tilting of the lab jack.</s>
          <s>Stoppers, shown in dark gray in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> , provided additional support to the optical components.</s>

          <s>System Features.</s>
          <s>The primary mechanisms for assembly of the system components were twist locks and sliding rails, both of which provided stability to the system.</s>
          <s>The twist locks permit a 90° rotation for locking.</s>
          <s>The only exception are the twist locks on the camera cages, which permit 360° rotation to provide the user with freedom in image orientation.</s>
          <s>The sliding rails allow for linear adjustments of the components in two dimensions.</s>
          <s>Both lab jacks and the tilting platform feature a grid of the twist locks and a sliding rail system along their lengths, to allow linear adjustment of both optical and perfusion components and to align and stabilize them.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the assembly mechanisms of various components of the system are compatible such that each major component can be included or excluded depending on the application, and many parts can be modified in size or shape while retaining system compatibility.</s>
          <s>For example, the lens sleeves can be modified for different lenses, the tilting platform can be excluded in a system that does not require upright imaging orientation, an additional emission filter cube can be included to measure an additional parameter, and the stationary optics holder can house a filter for single-camera imaging.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the individual components of the system can be scaled or easily modified to match other applications that vary in species of study and optics.</s>
          <s>Multi-parametric optocardiography is an important tool in studies of the mechanisms of cardiac physiology.</s>
          <s>For multi-parametric imaging, spatial accuracy when splitting signals to multiple photodetectors using a dichroic mirror is essential.</s>
          <s>The design of the emission filter cube achieves this by allowing the dichroic mirror angle to be finely adjusted and then secured in place using 3D-printed clips.</s>
          <s>The hydraulic lifts also contributed to spatial alignment by allowing fine adjustment of the camera height.</s>
          <s cert="0.4138890504837036" id="dataset-6" type="Tabular data">For whole-heart studies, a high quality pseudo-ECG was recorded using the customized electrode paddle, which secured the electrodes in place to maintain polarity and close proximity to the tissue for increased signal quality.</s>
          <s>The curved surface of the paddle stabilized the heart against the optical window to create a flat imaging surface.</s>
          <s>A similar design goal has previously been achieved for a Langendorff-perfused mouse heart chamber, however this design featured a tissue restrainer device with a separate electrode holder attached to the chamber using screws <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>While both of these chamber designs optimize placement of the heart and the electrodes, our new design achieves heart position stabilization and electrode placement by the paddle alone, which requires far less plastic and is more compact, a necessity for smaller tissue baths such as those for mouse hearts.</s>

          <s>In these systems, 3D-printed parts are essential in two ways: they have a primary function within the system and secondarily, their customizability permits optimal incorporation of any OTS equipment.</s>
          <s>In all studies, simple OTS parts increase the range of application of low-cost 3D-printed components to make an integrated, customized system.</s>

Table 1. Voltage and Calcium Parameters for Whole Mouse Hearts Treated with Pinacidil. Values are reported 
as mean ± standard error (n = 4). Voltage parameters include Action potential duration at 80% repolarization 
(APD80), rise time (RT), transverse conduction velocity (CV T ), longitudinal conduction velocity (CV L ), 
and anisotropic ratio (AR). Rise time was calculated as the time from 20% to 90% of maximum amplitude of 
upstroke of action potential. Anisotropic ratio was calculated as the ratio of CV L to CV T . Calcium parameters 
include calcium transient duration at 80% repolarization (CaTD80), rise time (RT), and the calcium transient 
decay constant (Tau). 300 μM of pinacidil significantly reduced action potential duration (p = 0.01).
