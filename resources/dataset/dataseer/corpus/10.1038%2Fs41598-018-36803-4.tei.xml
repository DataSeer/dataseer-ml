          <s>We designed an experimental paradigm to compare three different forms of learning: individual learning, when the monkey exploited a trial and error strategy to understand which of two stimuli is associated with a reward; social observational learning, in which the monkey observed a human model perform the task; non-social observational learning, where instead of a human model the monkey observed the choices of "computer model", in a ghost display condition.</s>

          <s>General aspects.</s>
          <s>Three monkeys performed three different versions of the object-in-place task (OIP; see Materials and Methods for detailed description).</s>
          <s>In this task, a trial began with the presentation of a central target (CT) on a touchscreen that the monkey had to touch to make a scene appear.</s>
          <s>A scene was composed of different geometrical figures and two different objects, one rewarded and the other not, composing the problem the monkeys had to solve.</s>
          <s>The monkeys had to perform five different problems to complete the first run of the task.</s>
          <s>After the first run, the second run started, with the same five problems presented in the same order, and so on until six runs were completed <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The three versions of the task differed with regard to the actor who performed the first run.</s>
          <s>In the monkey alone (MA) version, the first run was performed by the monkey, in the human interaction (HI) version by a human agent, and in the computer interaction (CI) version by the computer.</s>
          <s>In any case, the monkeys performed the remaining five.</s>
          <s>The data were collected on a total of 60 sessions for each monkey in each of the three versions of the task (MA, HI, CI) for a total amount of 540 sessions and 16 200 trials for all monkeys together.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>One-trial learning: monkey alone.</s>
          <s>We investigated the monkeys' ability to learn the correct response of each problem maintaining or changing choice depending on the outcome of the trials of the first run.</s>
          <s>To evaluate learning, we calculated the percentage of correct responses in each run.</s>
          <s>As expected, in the MA version, the animals performed at chance level in the first run (exact binomial test: Monkey M, 53.3%, p = 0.273; Monkey S, 52.3%, p = 0.453; Monkey D, 50%, p = 1), choosing randomly one of the two objects <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Instead, all monkeys performed above chance in the second run (exact binomial test: Monkey M, 81.7%, p &lt; 2.2e-16; Monkey S, 92.3%, p &lt; 2.2e-16; Monkey D, 80.3%, p &lt; 2.2e-16).</s>
          <s>This significant increase in the performance between the first and the second runs shows that monkeys learned from their choices during the first run improving their performance in the second run.</s>

          <s>respectively).</s>
          <s>These results show that the monkeys were able to learn after only one run also when they observed the task performed by another agent, either social or non-social.</s>
          <s>However, the comparison of the monkeys' performance in the three task versions showed a significant difference for Monkey M and Monkey S (one-way ANOVA, F (2,177) = 14.34, p = 1.7e-06 and F (2,177) = 17.37, p = 1.3e-07, respectively).</s>
          <s>A post hoc analysis revealed that the performance in the MA versions during the second run was significantly higher than in the HI and CI versions for Monkey M (MA vs HI, p = 0.0057 and MA vs CI, p = 2.9e-07, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test), while for Monkey S the performance in CI was significantly lower than in MA and HI (MA vs CI, p = 2.04e-08 and HI vs CI, p = 4.34e-04, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test).</s>
          <s>The performance during the second run showed no significant difference among the three versions of the task for Monkey D (one-way ANOVA, F (2,177) = 1.35, p = 0.26).</s>

        <head>Correct and errors.</head>
        <p>
          <s>We further investigated the consequences of successful or erroneous responses in the first run on the learning process by calculating the percentage of correct responses in the second run.</s>
          <s>The problems performed in the first run were divided into two groups: errors and correct choices.</s>
          <s>Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> shows the monkeys' performance in the second run separately for these two groups of problems.</s>
          <s>The scatterplot <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> shows the percentage of correct trials in the second run in both cases, after a correct response or after an error in the first run, in the three versions of the task.</s>
          <s>In the MA version, two monkeys were significantly more accurate in the second run after a correct choice than after an error in the first run (two-sample test for equality of proportions: Monkey M, p = 0.008; Monkey S, p = 0.016), while for the third one that difference was not significant (two-sample test for equality of proportions: Monkey D, p = 1).</s>
          <s>In general, the learning in this condition was more effective after a first correct choice than after a first incorrect choice.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, in both interactive versions of the task, HI and CI, we observed the opposite pattern.</s>
          <s>Two monkeys were significantly more accurate in the second run after the observation of the human partner or the computer making an incorrect choice rather than a correct choice in the first run (two-sample test for equality of proportions: HI and CI for Monkey M, p = 0.001 and p = 0.039 respectively; HI and CI for Monkey S, p = 0.019 and p = 0.009 respectively).</s>
          <s>The third monkey showed the other monkeys' tendency in the HI and CI conditions, although the difference was not significant (two-sample test for equality of proportions: HI and CI for Monkey D, p = 0.152 and p = 0.287 respectively).</s>
          <s>Altogether, the observational learning, social and non-social, allowed the monkey to reach better performance after the observation of an error rather than the observation of a correct choice.</s>
          <s>As a further control, we performed the same statistical analysis applying a Bayesian approach, using a Bayesian binomial test on the results in the first and in the second run, and implementing a Bayesian contingency table to test the difference between learning from correct and errors.</s>
          <s>The Bayesian method measures the Bayes Factor as a replacement of the p-values and the 95% credible intervals, enabling us to obtain a further confirmation of the strength of the results through a different approach (See Supplementary Methods, <ref type="table">Supplementary Tables S3 and S4</ref> ).</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>In this study we exploited a task design used to study one-trial learning in primate research.</s>
          <s>With different versions of the task, we assessed whether monkeys could benefit from the observation of an agent, social or non-social, in one-trial learning.</s>
          <s>The object-in-place paradigm <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31</ref> has been used recently in primates to study rapid learning about the relative value of unfamiliar stimuli <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>Alongside this, several studies demonstrated that rhesus macaques can monitor the action of another partner <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> and learn from the observation of a conspecific <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> or a human <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>To compare social and non-social observational learning (i.e.</s>
          <s>human and computer interaction), we removed the ambiguity on the perception of the outcome that would differentiate the two conditions.</s>
          <s>Indeed, while the reward could be delivered to the human it cannot be delivered to the computer.</s>
          <s>Some studies, attempted to control the "social aspect" of the partner by placing an empty chair and dropping the reward on the floor <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> or by showing the correct responses to the monkey via feedback without any delivery of reward <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , but the success of these strategies on monkeys remains unclear.</s>
          <s>Here, we decided to deliver a reward to the monkey after the correct responses of both human and computer models in all cases, to facilitate the task monitoring and the learning of the correct object in all three conditions.</s>
          <s>In all 3 monkeys, we found evidence of one-trial learning from their own first choice, from the observation of the choice of a social human agent, and even from the observation of a non-social agent.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Previous studies reported similar learning abilities in the interaction with humans 9,20,26 .</s>
          <s>Monfardini et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> proposed that the perceived similarity between the observer and the model plays a crucial role in the enhancement of performance during an observational learning task similar to that observed in humans <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>Critically, the observation of a human model simply showing the correct responses was not effective for generating learning by observation <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the contrary, observing a "monkey like" acting human, who ignored the monkey and consumed the reward in the case of correct choices, improved the performance of the monkey after observation <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>The vicarious aspect of the reward might seem critical to produce learning by observation.</s>
          <s>Indeed, in the studies that failed to report observational learning of non-human primates from human models <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> , the reward was not consumed by the model.</s>
          <s>However, this particular aspect of reward consumption falls short in our task, in which the monkeys consumed the reward after a correct response in all conditions.</s>
          <s>This difference between our study and past studies suggests that perceiving the others as similar might not be a prerequisite for observation learning.</s>
          <s>Alternately, the critical factor to promote the observational learning might be the evaluation of the outcome of an observed choice.</s>
          <s>In our case, monkeys directly experienced on themselves the outcome of another agent's choices, i.e. the reward delivery or its absence in correct and incorrect trials, respectively.</s>
          <s>Consequently, learning by observation can occur through vicarious reward <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> or, at least in the case of a one-trial learning, through non-vicarious reward: the key prerequisite is to provide a clear link between the observed choice and the outcome.</s>
          <s>In the previous works <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> , the association was made, as classically seen in the observational learning studies, between the behavior performed by the agent and the reward consumed by the agent.</s>
          <s>In our case, the association was made between the choice performed by the agent and the reward consumed by the observer, the monkey.</s>
          <s>The consumption of the reward, either by the monkey or the experimenter, could be the critical factor that promotes learning by observation through the generation of a clear choice-outcome association.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To maintain this association identical in both interaction conditions, we decided to apply the same paradigm in the computer condition.</s>
          <s>The computer's choice -monkey's reward consumption association was chosen to assess whether it is beyond the macaque ability to learn from observation from a non-physical agent, as previous studies seems to suggest, or if the past negative results of other studies were due to the inability to build such a clear association.</s>
          <s>Our main finding is that learning by observation occurred even with no real physical partner, in the computer interaction condition, also defined as a "ghost display" condition <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">39</ref> could learn in a ghost display condition.</s>
          <s>For example, 24-month-old children were able to replicate the actions of an "invisible agent" in a push or pull bidirectional task, after the simple observation of the door of the box moving by itself <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, great apes in the same paradigm were able to open the door of the box after the observation of the "ghost display" condition but were unable to match their actions with the previously observed one of the "invisible agent".</s>
          <s>Hopper et al. <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> evaluated chimpanzees in the ghost condition with an apparatus that either could be lifted or poked to receive a food reward.</s>
          <s>Learning occurred only when the animals observed a conspecific already trained to use the apparatus, before their own session.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, performance remained at chance when they observed the automatic movement of the device in the ghost condition.</s>
          <s>The same authors <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">28</ref> replicated an experimental paradigm previously used with birds <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> in which the door of a box containing the reward was moved in a ghost condition.</s>
          <s>In this situation, chimpanzees were able to extract the relevant information and match their movement with that of the "invisible agents", but only in the first responses.</s>
          <s>The authors explain this partial positive result compared to previous studies as being a direct consequence of the easy task requirements.</s>
          <s>More complex tasks, involving more sophisticated motor acts and/or the utilization of tools, are more demanding and seem more challenging to be learned by observation in the ghost display condition.</s>
          <s>If the complexity of the task requirements plays such an important role in the inability of monkeys to learn, it should not be surprising that learning abstract cognitive rules is beyond the bounds of possibility in ghost display conditions.</s>
          <s>Indeed, to our knowledge, the only study which tried to establish such cognitive learning in a ghost display condition in rhesus macaques <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> failed to find evidence of it.</s>
          <s>Subiaul et al. <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> trained two macaques to learn to respond in a prescribed order to a set of pictures displayed on a touchscreen.</s>
          <s>In the social learning condition, the monkeys learned a new sequence by observation of an "expert" monkey.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, in a "ghost display" condition (i.e. the observation of a monitor in which the task was carried on automatically, with all the auditory and visual feedback) there was no learning without the "expert" monkey working.</s>
          <s>Therefore, monkeys were able to learn by observation of a conspecific but not by observation of the correct sequence displayed automatically.</s>
          <s>In our task, the monkeys were trained to let the computer work automatically for the first run and observed the visual feedback and consumed the reward in the correct cases (50% of the trials approximately).</s>
          <s>In the second run, although generally to a lesser extent than in the MA and the HI conditions, the performance in the CI condition increased significantly over chance.</s>
          <s>To account for the differences between the results of the two experiments, we must consider three main factors.</s>
          <s>First, in the study of Subiaul and colleagues <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , monkeys worked on two different touchscreens in two different chambers separated by a transparent glass, side by side.</s>
          <s>During the "ghost display" condition, the touchscreen of the observer monkey was inactivated, and the monkey could monitor and learn from the observation of the touchscreen in the other chamber, where the second monkey was previously sitting.</s>
          <s>The lack of learning could be accounted for by the difficulty generated by that particular setting to attract attention to the events occurring in the next chamber in the absence of a real physical agent inside.</s>
          <s>We overcame that limitation, in our experiment running both human and computer interactive conditions on the same touchscreen where the monkey worked alone.</s>
          <s>The touchscreen was placed in front of the monkey in every condition and its head was fixed, therefore its attention on the task was maximized in all three conditions.</s>
          <s>Second, a fundamental difference between our task and the work of Subiaul et al. <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> is the reward delivery.</s>
          <s>With our task design the monkeys received the reward in the two observational learning conditions after a correct response.</s>
          <s>The positive feedback was combined with the reward delivery in the case of correct responses while the negative feedback was not followed by reward.</s>
          <s>Instead, in the study of Subiaul et al. <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> , monkeys could rely only on the auditory and visual feedback associated with the correct responses without receiving the reward.</s>
          <s>The mere presence of the feedback in the previous study <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> could not have been sufficient to enhance the performance in the "ghost display" condition.</s>
          <s>Third, the object-in-place task design is peculiar.</s>
          <s>The redundancy of information available in a typical scene, such as the background colour, the shapes forming the scene, the position of the objects or the shape of the objects themselves play a crucial role and enhance the learning, making the information much easier to remember.</s>
          <s>This paradigm is indeed used to generate one-trial learning processes.</s>
          <s>The classical Pavlovian conditioning and the instrumental conditioning are usually studied with behavioral tasks which require more trials to reach a learning criterion.</s>
          <s>We considered the difference between our paradigm and a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer in the Supplementary Discussion.</s>
          <s>The particularity of the OIP task lies in the fact that the learning process is facilitated by the presence of the background scene and the first observed or performed choice can be easily monitored to enhance the performance already on the second run of the task.</s>
          <s>In this task the background scene may be important for one-trial learning because it might have the function of a retrieval cue for each previous encountered scene such that its absence in conditional discrimination tasks prevent it <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>This particularity could explain why in our case, the monkeys were able to learn in the ghost display condition.</s>
          <s>During the human and computer interaction conditions, we did not control the position of the hand of the monkey when observing.</s>
          <s>However, we did not observe systematic arm movement during these trials (e. g. movement directed to the touchscreen without touching it) that could provide an alternative interpretation of our results.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our second finding is that different mechanisms underlie individual learning and observational learning: monkeys learned more from their own correct choices and more from the observation of other's mistakes.</s>
          <s>Other studies have already reported similar results in humans <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> , monkeys <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> and birds <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> demonstrating that learning from others' errors is easier than from their successes.</s>
          <s>Some studies highlighted and explained that this difference is likely due to the choice-induced preference <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>In psychology, cognitive dissonance theory assumes that human and non-human primates look for internal consistency <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[40]</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[41]</ref>
            <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[42]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, individuals value more the alternative they have precedingly chosen and encounter some difficulties in correcting personal mistakes.</s>
          <s>This is in line with errorless learning theory <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">43</ref> , claiming that errors are not necessary and discrimination learning does not require responses to the incorrect object.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, it has been shown that observing the lack of success of others is more informative and it is easier to learn after error <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">44</ref> .</s>
          <s>A hypothesis to explain this facilitation is based on gloating that refers to our own satisfaction of observing others' troubles.</s>
          <s>Gloating can explain the influence of such observation on later choices and the capacity to learn from other mistakes in humans <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the existence of such a mechanism has never been proved in non-human primates and that explanation could be ruled out by our paradigm because the reward was also obtained after others' correct actions.</s>
          <s>Moreover, in the present study we showed a similar learning after errors of social and non-social agents suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are comparable.</s>
          <s>Indeed, in the computer interaction, we observed the same effect as in the human interaction condition: observing computer mistakes appeared to be more informative for the monkeys than observing computer correct choices.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The study of the neural bases of social interactions and more precisely the monitoring of other choices and social learning is a current topic of interest.</s>
          <s>Brain responses during individual and observational learning have been studied and revealed a common network for these two types of learning <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, recent studies have emphasized the difference in the neural substrates between self and others at the single cell level, not only at the level of action and choices <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>

          <s>The present study sheds light on the existence of a one-trial observational learning from a non-social agent, in the so-called "ghost display" condition in macaque monkeys and creates a window of opportunity to better understand the neurophysiological substrates of observational learning.</s>
          <s>Although further work is needed to better understand the specificity of learning from social versus non-social agents, our work suggests that there should be a general reassessment of the idea that macaques cannot learn in the ghost condition.</s>

          <s>Task conditions.</s>
          <s>Monkeys performed three different versions of the OIP task: a monkey alone (MA) version, and two "interactive" versions: a human interaction (HI) version and a computer interaction (CI) version.</s>
          <s>With these task versions we could study individual learning, social observational learning, and non-social observational learning (from an external and non-social agent).</s>
          <s>In the MA version, the monkeys performed all six runs by themselves.</s>
          <s>In the HI version, the experimenter sat close to the monkey and faced the monitor.</s>
          <s>The time course of the task was identical except that the human performed the first run and the monkey observed without intervening.</s>
          <s>After the end of the first run, the monkey could complete the remaining runs (from the second to the sixth run).</s>
          <s>The human in the first run chose one of the two objects randomly therefore reaching chance level, resembling the monkeys' behavior in the first run of the MA condition (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The monkey received the reward only after a correct human choice and not after an error.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Finally, we carried out the CI version to test the non-social observational learning (by observation but in the absence of a real partner).</s>
          <s>Like in the HI version, the monkeys had to observe the first run and complete the remaining ones.</s>
          <s>Instead of a white CT, they recognized the appearance of a red CT in the first run as a stop signal.</s>
          <s>If the monkeys did not touch the screen, the computer trial continued, and the problem appeared on the monitor.</s>
          <s>Thus, the computer pseudorandomly performed the choice of one of two objects, selecting either the correct one or the incorrect one in equal proportions, similar to the HI and MA conditions (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>All the periods of the trial were identical to those of the other two versions, except for a randomly defined dummy time simulating the reaction times and the movement times of monkeys and humans (randomly selected between 650 and 950 ms).</s>
          <s>Then, the position and the type of visual feedback around one of the two objects informed the monkey about the computer choice.</s>
          <s>A reward was delivered to the animals after a correct computer choice and not after an error.</s>
          <s>Trials were aborted and restarted whenever the monkey touched the screen during any period of the computer trial.</s>

          <s>In most of the cases there was no improvement in one-trial learning over the sixty recorded sessions (see <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S2</ref> and <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>For the CI condition, monkeys were trained to recognize the appearance of a red CT instead of a white one as a stop signal for the execution of the trial.</s>
