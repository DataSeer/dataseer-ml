        <p>
          <s>We show that calcium ions alone not only mimic the conditioned media chemotactic effect, but also induce an osteogenic effect similar to that produced by transplanted MSC's in vivo.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the chemotactic effect induced by conditioned media is calcium and p38 dependent.</s>
          <s>The rise in cytosolic calcium might integrate the different signaling pathways triggered by conditioned media and extracellular Ca 2+ .</s>
          <s>This calcium-driven in situ bone regeneration is a promising and convenient alternative to promote endogenous cell recruitment into the injured bone site.</s>
          <s>This pre-clinical cell-free and growth factor-free approach might avoid the disadvantages of the ex vivo cell manipulation.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>The regeneration of oral and maxillofacial bone defects is one of the most challenging procedures in the clinical setting <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although bone is the hardest tissue in the human body, it can be incompletely formed congenitally, as in the case of cleft palate, or injured after trauma.</s>
          <s>When extensive bone damaged is produced, autografts or bone substitutes are required to restore anatomically and functionally such defects.</s>
          <s>Cell-based tissue engineering approaches have emerged as a promising alternative for autologous bone harvesting, but they require an appropriate donor site as cell source <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, an attractive strategy for bone regeneration is to identify effective chemotactic stimuli to recruit endogenous MSC's into the injured bone, avoiding the ex vivo cell manipulation <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The beneficial effects of MSC's transplantation and cell-based tissue engineering constructs rely on two primary mechanisms.</s>
          <s>First, they contribute to bone formation by their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, although the survival rate of the implanted cells is low <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, MSC's also secrete multiple paracrine signaling molecules that recruits host mesenchymal progenitor cells <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Increasing evidence suggests that this paracrine effect is the predominant osteogenic mechanism, reaching in some cases up to 80% of cell transplantation beneficial effects <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> [10] <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since these paracrine signals are released and can be collected from the conditioned media during MSC's culture, conditioned media has been used as a cell-free approach for bone regeneration <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Of note, MSC's conditioned media produces an osteogenic effect comparable or stronger than transplanted cells <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recently, it has also been reported that a specific mixture of cytokines, including IGF, VEGF and TGFβ1, can mimic the effect of the conditioned media for bone regeneration <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, bioactive molecules in conditioned media can be used as a cell-free approach, with equivalent effects than MSC's transplantation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>During the sequence of bone formation and regeneration undifferentiated progenitor cells are attracted to specific sites by chemotactic signals, and gradually differentiate into bone forming osteoblasts <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These osteoprogenitor cells secrete a myriad of growth factors that are stored in a collagenous extracellular matrix, which eventually mineralizes <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Concentrations of soluble calcium in the bone microenvironment are in the mM range, <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> whereas the organic fraction containing the growth factors are present in a pico-nM range <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among these stored growth factors in bone matrix are BMP2, TGFβ, PDGF, IGF, FGF, or PDGF <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> [21] <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>After bone resorption a mixture of dissolved ions and degraded organic components are released into the extracellular space.</s>
          <s>Despite inorganic ions and growth factors are different in their biological nature, they induce a common chemotactic effect on undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recently, we reported that specific CaSO 4 concentrations promote MSC's recruitment and infiltration into a cell-free tissue engineering construct <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This chemotactic effect is calcium-dependent, since extracellular calcium chelation inhibits such effects <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR) inhibition also disrupted the MSC's chemotactic response to calcium, showing that this receptor is also essential to induce cell recruitment <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In fact, extracellular calcium alone shows a cell migration effect, which is comparable to that induced by BMP-2 or VEGF [23] <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since both conditioned media and calcium ions induce bone regeneration by recruiting host's MSC's, we hypothesized that both conditions could have a similar paracrine chemotactic effect on calvarial cells.</s>
          <s>To demonstrate our hypothesis, we compare the chemotactic effects in vitro, and using a calvarial explant model ex vivo.</s>
          <s>Moreover, an in vivo calvarial bone defect model was used to compare their bone regeneration ability.</s>
          <s>We also evaluated the potential molecular mechanisms involved in this chemotactic effect.</s>
          <s>Our results may provide support for an alternative approach for bone regeneration that eliminates cell culture and transplantation, and does not require the use of recombinant growth factors.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We demonstrated that cell-free scaffolds containing Ca 2+ mimic the chemotactic effect of conditioned media.</s>
          <s>In addition, calcium also induce a bone regenerative effect similar to MSC's in vivo.</s>
          <s>Calcium itself initiates cell infiltration into the scaffold, and over time a paracrine effect might be produced by up-regulating the expression of multiple endogenous cytokines.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the p38 activity is differentially required by extracellular calcium and conditioned media to promote the cell recruitment.</s>
          <s>However, the elevation of cytosolic calcium is an essential event for both stimuli to induce the chemotactic cell response.</s>
          <s>The calcium-driven in situ bone regeneration approach could eliminate the requirement for ex vivo cell isolation and manipulation, and also the need of recombinant growth factors.</s>

        <figDesc>The effect of calcium or conditioned media on migration was evaluated by an agarose spot assay. (A) Three spots were plated on the same dish, one containing PBS, 10 mM CaSO 4 or conditioned media. Primary calvarial cell migration under each agarose spot was evaluated and quantified using ImageJ software. The experiment was repeated five times. (B) Calvaria were divided into two halves and a full thickness defect of 0.8 mm of diameter was created. Halves were placed individually in a 24-well plate serum free media (negative control), 15% FBS, 2.5 mM of CaSO 4 in 15% FBS media or conditioned media (n = 10). After two weeks, calvaria were fixed, images taken, and then prepared for histological evaluation. The percentage of regenerated bone was quantified by ImageJ. Representative images of each group are displayed. 20X scale = 400 μm. Differences are considered significant at p&lt;0.05.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210301.g001</figDesc>
