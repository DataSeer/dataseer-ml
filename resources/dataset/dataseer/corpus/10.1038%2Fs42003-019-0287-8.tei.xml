          <s>The productivity hypothesis predicts that FCL increases with increasing productivity, because higher energy availability at the base of the food web allows for the existence of higher trophic levels, given the transfer efficiencies between trophic levels <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2,</ref>

          <s>The disturbance hypothesis, also termed as the dynamic constraints hypothesis, predicts that more frequent or more intense disturbance in ecosystems would shorten FCL, because longer chains are less resilient and thus unlikely to persist in disturbed habitats <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>

          <s>Thus our microcosms provided first evidence for a variability of FCL with community assembly history and novel insights in the relationship between productivity and FCL.</s>

          <s>When the top predator invaded in the food web later, it performed as a top predator mainly feeding on the intraguild predator (Blepharisma), and consequently the system had a longer FCL.</s>
          <s>When the top predator copepods were introduced before the intraguild predator (Blepharisma), they only fed on the intraguild prey (Tetrahymena) feeding on bacteria, thereby depressing the population level of Tetrahymena.</s>
          <s>Therefore, Blepharisma had a trophic level of~2, similar to Tetrahymena.</s>

          <s>The points are outliers When Blepharisma primarily feeds on Tetrahymena, the copepod fed on a prey with a trophic level &gt;2.</s>
          <s>Therefore, another mechanism can be assumed that the intraguild predator did not successfully compete for the bacteria with the intraguild prey and consequently had lower abundances.</s>
          <s>Moreover, lower Blepharisma/Tetrahymena ratios were observed at TCB sequence, which may also reduce the trophic position of the top predator due to lowered relative abundance of the intraguild predator.</s>
          <s>Our experiment therefore highlights the role of priority effects of consumer introduction and top predator's adaptive foraging for defining maximum FCL.</s>
          <s>We found such priority effects on FCL in a reduced web with three consumer species only, therefore it will be important to analyze historical contingencies in real ecosystems, in order to see whether our results can be transferred to natural ecosystems with more complex network structures.</s>

          <s>The food-web model by Kondoh and Ninomiya <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> suggested that FCL can be shorter with increasing productivity when considering adaptive foraging of consumers.</s>

          <s>In fact, the abundance of the primary consumer Tetrahymena increased at highest productivity, which may explain the shortened FCL we found at high productivity levels, if the top predator fed more on the more abundant primary consumer, Tetrahymena.</s>
          <s>We have no evidence whether the intraguild predator (Blepharisma) also changed its foraging to bacteria with productivity as we did not measure the isotopic composition of the ciliates in our experiment.</s>
          <s>Some of the previous studies reported the lack of a positive correlation between productivity and FCL 12,14,21 , which could be explained by historical contingency masking the productivity effect on FCL.</s>
          <s>If the adaptive foraging of top predator changed the food web structure along with historical contingency, the predator would maximize the food-web stability according to the expectation by the mathematical model of Kondoh <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
