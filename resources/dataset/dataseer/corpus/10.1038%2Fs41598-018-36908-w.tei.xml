          <s>Effects of salt-processing on chemical composition.</s>
          <s>The levels of bioactive components in SPF extract were 30-50% higher than those in PF extract.</s>
          <s>This could be attributed to the following two aspects.</s>
          <s>(1) PF expanded in volume, and the internal micro-structure became loose due to the heating effect during salt-processing.</s>
          <s>Hence, it was easier for water to permeate into medicinal materials, dissolve the bioactive components, and then diffuse smoothly into the decoction in the boiling process.</s>
          <s>(2) Under the effects of high temperature and sodium ions, linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid in PF could generate sodium linoleate, sodium oleate, sodium palmitate and sodium stearate, which were substances possessing surface activity <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>Surfactants could form micelles in water, which increased the solubility of the other slightly soluble components in PF 15 .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the overall level of bioactive components in extract increased significantly after salt-processing.</s>

          <s>Effects of salt-processing on absorption characteristics.</s>
          <s>AUC, C max and t max are often employed to characterize the degree, intensity and speed of absorption, respectively.</s>

          <s>This principle could be demonstrated by the following three points.</s>
          <s>(1) The surfactants generated during salt-processing could dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, thereby enhancing the permeability of the membrane and absorption of the components <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The complexes formed by surfactants and certain components changed the physical and chemical properties of the original compounds, such as solubility, molecular size, diffusion velocity and oil/water partition coefficient, and enhanced the associated membrane permeability <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> PF has the function of accelerating gastrointestinal peristalsis.</s>
          <s>Administration of PF extract would cause more bioactive components to gather at the absorption site simultaneously and result in shorter residence time.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the corresponding results of higher C max , shorter t max and lower AUC in the PF group could be explained.</s>
          <s>In contrast, SPF could inhibit gastrointestinal motility efficaciously, slowing down the movement of bioactive components in the gastrointestinal tract and resulting in longer t max , lower C max and higher AUC <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, this also provided theoretical support for the enhanced anti-diarrhoeal effect of PF after salt-processing.</s>
          <s>Effects of salt-processing on comprehensive efficacy.</s>
          <s>Enhancing the efficacy.</s>
          <s>PF is usually used for improving the osteoporosis and diarrhoea in clinic.</s>
          <s>Before the present study, we investigated the effects of PF and SPF in both an osteoporosis model and a diarrhoea model.</s>
          <s>The results showed that SPF was more efficacious than PF in treating both osteoporosis and diarrhoea (detailed information is shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Information, section 2 and section 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In the present study, the levels of deoxycytidine monophosphate, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, PGE 0 , citicoline, phenylethylamine and D-glucose in SPF group were higher than that in PF group <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, SPF possessed a stronger effect than PF, which might be related to the increased contents of bioactive components in extract and the enhanced absorption in vivo after salt-processing.</s>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>Due to the similar effect with PGI 2 , the PGE 0 /TXA 2 value can be a substitute for the PGI 2 /TXA 2 value.</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> , the PGE 0 /TXA 2 value in the SPF group was higher than that in the PF group, suggesting that the toxic side effect of PF on the renal system could be alleviated by salt-processing.</s>

          <s>LysoPCs can also induce or aggravate renal cell damage by accelerating the exchange rate between cytomembrane and cytoplasm <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26</ref> .</s>
          <s>Compared with the C group, the levels of lysoPCs were upregulated in the PF group and showed a downward trend in the SPF group <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results indicated that the toxic side effects of PF on the cardiovascular and renal systems could be alleviated by salt-processing.</s>
          <s>All alleviation in toxicity might be attributed to the loss of volatile components during the heating process of salt-processing.</s>
          <s>Bakuchiol, as an example, is one of the major volatile components in PF <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">27</ref> and achieves the maximum decrease in relative content after salt-processing <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28</ref> .</s>
          <s>It has been reported that bakuchiol exhibited cytotoxicity and its metabolites were against human kidney-2 cell line <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, the lower the amounts of volatile components were, the weaker the toxic side effects of PF would be.</s>

          <s>Under the actions of different enzymes, sphinganine and phytosphingosine are converted into other important metabolites in sphingolipid metabolism, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30,</ref>

          <s>Ceramide, an important second messenger, plays a key role in apoptosis <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>Studies have shown that long chain ceramide can induce osteoblast apoptosis <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>As shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> , both PF and SPF inhibited the levels of sphinganine, phytosphingosine and the associated sphingolipid metabolism.</s>
          <s>I.e., PF and SPF could reduce the level of ceramide in vivo, inhibit osteoblast apoptosis and prevent osteoporosis, by inhibiting sphingolipid metabolism.</s>
          <s>Additionally, PF and SPF exhibited similar impacts on arachidonic acid, hexadecasphinganine, diisobutyl phthalate, 1-monopalmitin, cholesteryl acetate and L-histidinol.</s>
          <s>These results lead to the hypothesis that the type and/or contents of certain components might be altered in the salt-processing procedure, but the basic chemical composition was preserved.</s>

          <s>The comprehensive mechanism of salt-processing on PF.</s>
          <s>The two main steps of salt-processing were (i) infiltration by salt solution and (ii) stir-frying over a flame.</s>
          <s>The heat from the flame made the internal structure of PF loose and caused the volatile components to vaporize.</s>
          <s>The combined effects of high temperature and sodium ions initiated the emergence of surfactants, which could form micelles in water, combine with some components to generate complexes and dissolve the membrane lipid of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells.</s>
          <s>The loosened structure and solubilization effect from micelles were crucial to the increased content of bioactive components in extract.</s>
          <s>The newly generated complexes and membrane lipid solubility of surfactants made it easy for the bioactive components to pass through the absorption barrier.</s>
          <s>Therefore, both the enhancements in the content and in the absorption of the bioactive components contributed to the strengthened efficacy of SPF.</s>
          <s>Moreover, volatilization loss that occurred during the heating operation was the principal reason for the alleviated toxic effects of SPF.</s>
          <s>The comprehensive mechanism of salt-processing on PF was simplified in <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Research based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was successfully performed to explore the comprehensive effects of salt-processing on PF.</s>
          <s>The internal correlations among chemical composition, absorption characteristics and action mechanism, together with the influence of salt-processing, have led to the discovery of the salt-processing mechanism.</s>
          <s>In summary, the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants in the salt-processing procedure are the primary cause of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity of SPF.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, this integrated novel strategy is a feasible approach for future mechanism study of herb-processing.</s>
          <s>Voucher specimens were deposited in Henan University of Chinese Medicine.</s>
          <s>SPF were processed according to our previous study <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34</ref> .</s>
          <s>Briefly, the PF were mixed with 20% (20:100, salt-water, w/v) salt solution (10:1, PF-salt solution, w/v) and placed in a closed container until salt solution was absorbed completely by PF.</s>
          <s>Then the moistened PF were stir-fried in a metallic pan over a low flame at 130 ± 20 °C for 8.5 min.</s>
          <s>After cooling, the SPF were dried in vacuum drying oven at 40 °C for 24 h.</s>

        <figDesc>,b, clear Quantitative analysis results for all analytes in PF and SPF extract. The structures of potential biomarkers were then identified on the basis of data information, including MS/MS fragment, accurate mass and the origin in the Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/); Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/); MassBank (http://www.massbank.jp/) and KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/). Further confirmation was achieved by comparing retention times and MS/ MS fragment patterns with reference standards when necessary. Based on the above strategies, a total of 33 and 36 biomarkers in response to PF and SPF exposure, respectively, were obtained and were listed inSupplementary Tables S6 and S7.</figDesc>
