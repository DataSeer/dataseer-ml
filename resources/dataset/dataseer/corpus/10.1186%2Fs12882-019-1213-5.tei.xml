            <s>Background: Reproductive function in women with end stage renal disease generally improves after kidney transplant.</s>
            <s>However, pregnancy remains challenging due to the risk of adverse clinical outcomes.</s>
            <s>Methods: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Elsevier EMBASE, Scopus, BIOSIS Previews, ISI Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from date of inception through August 2017 for studies reporting pregnancy with kidney transplant.</s>
            <s>Results: Of 1343 unique studies, 87 met inclusion criteria, representing 6712 pregnancies in 4174 kidney transplant recipients.</s>
            <s>Mean maternal age was 29.6 ± 2.4 years.</s>
            <s>The live-birth rate was 72.9% (95% CI, 70.0-75.6).</s>
            <s>The rate of other pregnancy outcomes was as follows: induced abortions (12.4%; 95% CI, 10.4-14.7),</s>
            <s>miscarriages (15.4%; 95% CI, 13.8-17.2),</s>
            <s>stillbirths (5.1%; 95% CI, 4.0-6.5),</s>
            <s>ectopic pregnancies (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7),</s>
            <s>preeclampsia (21.5%; 95% CI, 18.5-24.9),</s>
            <s>gestational diabetes (5.7%; 95% CI, 3.7-8.9),</s>
            <s>pregnancy induced hypertension (24.1%; 95% CI, 18.1-31.5),</s>
            <s>cesarean section (62.6, 95% CI 57.6-67.3),</s>
            <s>and preterm delivery was 43.1% (95% CI, 38.7-47.6).</s>
            <s>Mean gestational age was 34.9 weeks, and mean birth weight was 2470 g.</s>
            <s>The 2-3-year interval following kidney transplant had higher neonatal mortality, and lower rates of live births as compared to &gt; 3 year, and &lt; 2-year interval.</s>
            <s>The rate of spontaneous abortion was higher in women with mean maternal age &lt; 25 years and &gt; 35 years as compared to women aged 25-34 years.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: Although the outcome of live births is favorable, the risks of maternal and fetal complications are high in kidney transplant recipients and should be considered in patient counseling and clinical decision making.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Women with end stage renal disease have impaired fertility due to disruption of hypothalamic gonadal axis.</s>
          <s>Pregnancy is therefore rare in women on dialysis with very low incidence of conception ranging from 0.9 to 7% <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since there is rapid restoration of fertility, in some cases, within 6 months following transplantation, kidney transplantation offers the best hope to women with end-stage renal disease who wish to become pregnant <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Pregnancy in a kidney transplant recipient continues to remain challenging due to risk of adverse maternal complications of preeclampsia and hypertension, and risk of adverse fetal outcomes of premature birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, there is risk of side effects from immunosuppressive medication, and risk of deterioration of allograft function <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, preconception counseling, family planning and contraception are pertinent parts of the transplant counseling process.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Data on clinical outcomes of pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients is limited from case reports, single-center studies, and voluntary registries.</s>
          <s>The usefulness of the voluntary registries is further limited due to underreporting and incomplete data capture <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive metanalysis on post-kidney transplant pregnancy outcomes has been performed in the recent years <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since kidney transplant is common in women of child bearing age and most of the data on outcomes of pregnancy comes from these retrospective studies, our metaanalysis is both timely and important.</s>
          <s>The comprehensive analysis of various worldwide registries, single-center studies, and case series will provide generalizable inferences about post-kidney transplant pregnancy outcomes, and help guide the pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients.</s>
          <s>The primary goal of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to systematically identify all studies of pregnancy-related outcomes in kidney transplant recipients from all around the world, and estimate pooled incidences of pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and fetal complications.</s>
          <s>The secondary goals were to examine the impact of pregnancy on the kidney allograft loss, allograft rejection, identify ideal maternal age of conception, and determine ideal time of conception between kidney transplant and pregnancy.</s>

          <s>The results of our meta-analysis show that although majority of pregnancies in women after kidney transplant result in live birth, both maternal and fetal adverse events are common.</s>
          <s>Rates of preeclampsia, still birth, and cesarean section were significantly higher than in the general population.</s>
          <s>In the cohort considered for the analysis, a quarter of women had serious pregnancy complications, defined as at least one of preterm delivery, first or second trimester loss, stillbirth, or neonatal death.</s>
          <s>Additionally, rates of preterm delivery, still births, and neonatal mortality were higher as compared with the US recent national data.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The live birth rates in women after kidney transplant were higher than in the general population (73% vs. 62%) and this trend was consistent throughout the globe <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our study confirms the findings from The National Transplant Pregnancy Registry from the United States that reported a live birth rate of 71-76% <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, meta-analysis done by Deshpande et al. examined pregnancy outcomes of 4706 pregnancies in women with kidney transplant and reported a live birth rate of 73.5% <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The higher live birth rate, although appears encouraging, may reflect a reporting bias or a selection bias in which relatively healthy women decided to pursue pregnancy, and subsequently received better medical support by multiple specialties.</s>
          <s>It is also important to consider that there are inconsistencies in definition of live birth rate used in various studies, for example live birth rate was defined as per 1000 female transplant recipients in some studies, whereas per 1000 pregnancies in transplant recipients in others <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Live birth rate in general population (comparison group) is defined by Centers for Disease Control as live births per 1000 population <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, it remains unclear how the multiple gestation pregnancy outcomes were evaluated in these studies.</s>
          <s>Contrary to the above findings of successful pregnancies, a US health utilization study found a much lower live birth rate of 55% in kidney transplant recipients.</s>
          <s>They attributed this finding of low live birth rate to underestimation of fetal loss <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Davison et al. estimated that just under 40% of conceptions do not go beyond the first trimester, but of those that do, greater than 90% end successfully <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another explanation of high live birth rate in our study could be the exclusion of studies that reported pregnancy outcomes with teratogenic immunosuppressive medications of mycophenolate and sirolimus.</s>
          <s>Our study highlights the significantly higher risk of maternal and fetal complications in women with kidney transplants.</s>
          <s>About a quarter of women developed preeclampsia, and the rates of preeclampsia were almost six fold higher as compared to the general US population (21.5% vs. 3.8%) <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Vannevel et al. in an international multicenter retrospective cohort of 52 women who underwent kidney transplantation reported preeclampsia rate of as high as 38%, and chronic hypertension rate of 27% <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hypertension is common in kidney transplant recipients prior to conception with a reported incidence of 52 to 69% <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several factors can contribute to the onset of hypertension after renal transplantation, including but not limited to the type of immunosuppressive therapy (calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids), allograft function, donor type, obesity, alcohol, smoking, and presence of a native kidney (increased production of renin) <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia can be difficult in kidney transplant patients due to higher frequency of preexisting hypertension and proteinuria <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

          <s>Although, the increased rate of gestational diabetes in kidney transplant patients can be well explained by the use of immunosuppressive medications like steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, the striking differences between rates of gestational diabetes according to geographic location also highlights the importance of predisposition to diabetes due to ethnicity.</s>

          <s>While prior studies have not reported higher rates of neonatal mortality and stillbirths in kidney transplant recipients, the current study finding is highly significant.</s>
          <s>Possible reasons could be prematurity, preeclampsia or presence of other risk factors like hypertension, proteinuria, and serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl or higher <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref>

          <s>In our study, the rate of cesarean section was higher than two folds as compared to general population in United States, and varied from 60 to 77% across different geographical locations.</s>
          <s>Bramham et al. reported that more than three quarters of the deliveries in kidney transplant recipients were by cesarean section, but only 3% were performed for the indication of renal transplant <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>

          <s>There was a high rate of premature births in the transplant population in the present study and close to half of the live births were premature deliveries.</s>
          <s>Prior studies have showed a preterm birth rate of 40-60% in kidney transplant recipients <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>

          <s>Maternal complication of cesarean section and preeclampsia were higher in the 2-3 and &gt; 3 year interval.</s>
          <s>In contrast, Deshpande et al. reported both the highest maternal complications of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and gestational diabetes, and least favorable delivery outcome of preterm births in the &lt; 2 year interval as compared to &gt; 2 year interval between kidney transplant and pregnancy <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However their analysis was limited by inclusion of only 3 studies in the &lt; 2 interval following kidney transplant.</s>
          <s>Overall, fetal outcomes in &lt; 2 year interval seem most favorable in our study but merits further investigation due to limitation of the retrospective study design, small numbers, and possible reporting bias associated with data from voluntary registries.</s>
          <s>A significant strength of our study is that it involves a large number of pregnant renal transplant recepients from all around the globe, thus providing us with information about pregnancy outcomes for a heterogenous population.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we have analyzed region specific outcomes and identified outcomes which may require intensive management pertaining to that region.</s>

          <s>We examined pregnancy outcomes over several decades in the present study.</s>
          <s>While it is expected for the outcomes to change due to improvement in obstetric care in kidney transplant recipients over the course of time, subgroup analysis for studies from 2000 to 2017 showed consistent results.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>This meta analysis of pregnancy outcomes in 6712 pregnancies in 4174 kidney transplant recipients with data spread over different decades from all over the world shows favorable outcomes with live birth rates exceeding that in the recent national population.</s>
          <s>Majority of patients preserve their graft.</s>
          <s>However, pregnancy after renal transplant confers significant risk in terms of maternal and fetal adverse events, including increased rates of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean section rates, and pregnancy induced hypertension.</s>
          <s>The risk of prematurity and low birth rate are also high.</s>
          <s>Areas which need to be studied in the future include type of immunosuppression and its correlation with specific pregnancy outcomes; and evaluation of risk factors associated with specific maternal and fetal adverse events.</s>
          <s>The definitions used in evaluating these outcomes also need to be standardized.</s>
          <s>The results of this study can help the health care providers with appropriate counseling and individualized management of this high risk population.</s>
