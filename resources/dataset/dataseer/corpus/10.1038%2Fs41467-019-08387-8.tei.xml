            <s>Similar analysis of human embryos is limited to preimplantation stages, since early post-implantation embryos are largely inaccessible.</s>
            <s>Notwithstanding, we previously suggested conserved principles of pig and human early development.</s>
            <s>For further insight on pluripotent states and lineage delineation, we analysed pig embryos at single cell resolution.</s>
            <s>Here we show progressive segregation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm in early blastocysts, and of epiblast and hypoblast in late blastocysts.</s>
            <s>We show that following an emergent short naive pluripotent signature in early embryos, there is a protracted appearance of a primed signature in advanced embryonic stages.</s>
            <s>Dosage compensation with respect to the X-chromosome in females is attained via X-inactivation in late epiblasts.</s>
            <s>Detailed human-pig comparison is a basis towards comprehending early human development and a foundation for further studies of human pluripotent stem cell differentiation in pig interspecies chimeras.</s>

          <s>re-gastrulation embryo development shows broad similarities between mammals, although species-specific differences in early lineage segregation, the establishment of pluripotency, and X-chromosome inactivation have been reported <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Mouse embryos, which are widely used as a model for mammals, transit rapidly through this early development phase (E0-E5.5)</s>
          <s>that culminates with the formation of the characteristic cup-shaped post-implantation epiblast.</s>
          <s>In larger mammals, including humans, non-human primates (NHP) and pigs, there is a protracted developmental period (~10-12 days) that ends with the formation of a flat bilaminar embryonic disc.</s>
          <s>Since early postimplantation human embryos are largely inaccessible, and currently can only be studied with novel in vitro systems <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">5</ref> , we are beginning to investigate relatively more accessible pig embryos.</s>
          <s>Notably both human and pig embryos evidently form a flat embryonic disc before the onset of gastrulation <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the pig embryo can broaden our understanding of the pre-gastrulation development of large mammals with protracted development.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Segregation of trophectoderm (TE) and hypoblast, and the emergence of pluripotency are well established in mice, but require detailed studies in other mammals at the resolution of single cells, as recently reported for Cynomolgus monkeys <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">2</ref> .</s>
          <s>Potential discrepancies in lineage segregation have however emerged in reports between monkey and human, attributed in part to embryo staging differences <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
          <s>Further studies, including those in other large mammalian species, are therefore highly desirable.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In mouse embryos a distinct transcriptional signature of pluripotency in the inner cell mass (ICM) undergoes changes as the epiblast (EPI) matures and develops further marking a transition through pluripotency before gastrulation <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">8</ref> .</s>
          <s>These transitory stages can be recapitulated in vitro in naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which resemble pre-implantation epiblast cells, and primed PSCs resembling the post-implantation mouse epiblast <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>Establishment of similar cell lines from non-rodent mammalian species, including humans, has been challenging, suggesting possible biological differences <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>Indeed, spatiotemporal differences in the expression of core pluripotency genes NANOG, OCT4 (POU5F1) and SOX2 have been noted, while the expression of Klf2, Prdm14 and Bmp4, observed in mouse embryonic naive cells, are apparently not detectable in human embryos <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>By contrast, KLF17 is expressed in the human but not mouse ICM <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, while members of the Jak-Stat3 and WNT signalling pathways are detected in the early mouse ICM <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">13</ref> , many TGFβ signalling components are found in marmoset, human and pig ICM <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[13]</ref>

          <s>ICM cells of early pig blastocysts co-express EPI (NANOG, SOX2) and HYPO (GATA6, PDGFRα, SOX17) markers, but during the mid-/late blastocyst stage EPI and HYPO lineages become definitively segregated, indicating that ICM cells are bi-potent, able to give rise to mature EPI and HYPO, as shown in mouse <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">46</ref> , human <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">23</ref> and monkey <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">2</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>Pathway analysis revealed Jak-Stat signalling enrichment in TE and ICM of early embryos.</s>
          <s>The Jak-Stat pathway is an effector of multiple ligand/receptor interactions including members of the IL6 family, such as LIF, GCSF and IL6.</s>
          <s>A previous study showed that Jak-Stat signalling is essential for TE development in the pig <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although there is expression of LIFR in some ICM and TE of early blastocysts, there is no expression of LIF; either in any of the cells of the blastocyst, or in the maternal endometrial cells at this stage <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">47</ref> , suggesting that LIF signalling does not have a significant role in early pig embryos.</s>
          <s>Instead, expression of IL6 in morulae and TE cells of EB, and IL6R and the co-receptor IL6ST (also known as GP130) in ICM and TE cells, suggests that IL6 likely activates the Jak-Stat pathway by binding to its cognate receptor.</s>
          <s>IL-6 supplementation had a modest effect in promoting TE proliferation, and did not affect ICM development, in contrast to a previous report on parthenogenetic pig embryos <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">48</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, IL6 −/− gene-edited embryos had a reduced number of TE cells, but unaffected ICM.</s>
          <s>Given that blocking Jak-Stat signalling results in a reduction in TE cells, these experiments show that Jak-Stat signalling via IL6 has a critical role during pig TE specification.</s>
          <s>Since Jak-Stat signalling can be stimulated by other pathways <ref target="#b64" type="bibr">49</ref> , such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK, which we showed can affect the number of ICM cells when blocked, the effects of Jak inhibition on the ICM may be indirect and not specific to IL6 signalling.</s>

          <s>Only when using high concentrations of MEK inhibition we detected a drastic decrease in SOX17 expression, as reported in cattle <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">28</ref> , suggesting that alternative pathways may be supporting HYPO segregation in large mammals.</s>

          <s>Similarly, NANOG expression in pig embryos is also affected by inhibition with SB431542.</s>

          <s>In mice, imprinted XCI results in inactivation of the paternal XC in early cleaving embryos, followed by reactivation in the ICM of blastocyst (excluding the extraembryonic tissues), and then random XCI in the epiblast <ref target="#b71" type="bibr">56</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, there is no imprinted XCI in human and rabbit embryos.</s>
          <s>Indeed, the expression of XIST from both X chromosomes in blastocysts suggests alternative mechanisms of dosage compensation <ref target="#b71" type="bibr">56</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b73" type="bibr">58</ref> .</s>
          <s>Notably, our observations however show XCI in the mature EPI, as demonstrated by the reduction in the number of biallelically expressed X-linked genes, coupled with the appearance of the H3K27me3 mark on the inactive XC.</s>

          <s>Our study at the resolution of single cells allows comparisons between species to identify developmental equivalence.</s>
          <s>Comparison of mouse and pig pluripotent matched stages showed broad developmental alignment, although the developmental time in mice is three times shorter compared to pigs (2 days vs. 6 days).</s>
          <s>Yet the overall principles of the emergence and establishment of pluripotency are conserved between these species <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">(Fig. 9a)</ref> .</s>

          <s>Hitherto, the reported efficiency of these experiments is very low <ref target="#b74" type="bibr">59</ref> , perhaps because the hESCs were not in-sync with the host pig blastocyts.</s>
          <s>Developmental synchrony between donor and host is important for efficient chimerism <ref target="#b75" type="bibr">60</ref> .</s>

Only validated SNVs (dbSNP flag VLD) were extracted for downstream analysis. SnpEff (v4.3) was applied to annotate called SNVs with Sus scrofa v10.2 ensembl annotation (build 87). Low coverage SNVs (&lt;3 reads) were excluded from the analysis, and we only kept SNVs that occurred at least in two different cells for each stage.
