            <s>Background: Prognostic measures to determine burn mortality are essential in evaluating the severity of individual burn victims.</s>
            <s>This is an important process of triaging patients with high risk of mortality that may be nursed in the acute care setting.</s>
            <s>Malaysian burn research is lacking with only one publication identified which describes the epidemiology of burn victims.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the objective of this study was to go one step further and identify the predictors of burn mortality from a Malaysian burns intensive care unit (BICU) which may be used to triage patients at higher risk of death.</s>
            <s>Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all admissions to Hospital Sultan Ismail's BICU from January 2010 till October 2015.</s>
            <s>Admission criteria were in accordance with the American Burn Association guidelines, and risk factors of interest were recorded.</s>
            <s>Data was analyzed using simple logistic regression to determine significant predictors of mortality.</s>
            <s>Survival analysis with time to death event was performed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve with log-rank test.</s>
            <s>Results: Through the 6-year period, 393 patients were admitted with a male preponderance of 73.8%.</s>
            <s>The mean age and length of stay were 35.6 (±15.72) years and 15.3 (±18.91)</s>
            <s>days.</s>
            <s>There were 48 mortalities with an overall mortality rate of 12.2%.</s>
            <s>Significant risk factors identified on simple logistic regression were total body surface area (TBSA) &gt; 20% (p &lt; 0.001), inhalation injury (p &lt; 0.001) and presence of early systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (p &lt; 0.001).</s>
            <s>Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed similar results with TBSA &gt; 20%, presence of SIRS, mechanical ventilation and inhalation injury which were associated with poorer survival (p &lt; 0.001).</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The predictors of mortality identified in a Malaysian BICU were TBSA &gt; 20%, early SIRS, mechanical ventilation and inhalation injury which were associated with poorer survival outcome.</s>
            <s>The immunological response differs from individual patients and influenced by the severity of burn injury.</s>
            <s>Early SIRS on admission is an important predictor of death and may represent the severity of burn injury.</s>
            <s>Patients who required mechanical ventilation were associated with mortality and it is likely related to the severity of pulmonary insults sustained by individual patients.</s>
            <s>This data is important for outcome prognostication and mortality risk counselling in severely burned patients.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Over the past decade, improvement and advancements of health care services have allowed more severely burned patients to survive <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Current burn management coupled with specialized intensive care treatment led to the survival of young and healthy individuals sustaining major burn injury.</s>
          <s>This would have been fatal in comparison with medical care over a century ago <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In developed countries, burn injuries account for more than 50,000 admissions with a mortality rate of 5-6% <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, when complicated with inhalation injury, the death rate increases with a reported mortality rate of over 30% <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The purported increase in death rate is explained by the difference in characteristics of burn injuries which varies from developing and developed nations.</s>
          <s>In developed nations, the ageing individuals are the fastest growing populations especially in Europe and America <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, the mean age of burn patients admitted for burn injury in developed nations of Canada and Spain was higher than 44.7 and 53 years old respectively <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In comparison with a population from a developing nation of Ecuador, the injured were younger patients with a mean age of 33 years <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Clearly, the difference in the demography of burn population showed that younger active citizens were more prone to burn injuries in developing nations.</s>
          <s>This is a growing concern for developing nations as the younger population represents the majority of the workforce that drives the local economy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Local data and research in predictors of burn mortality and its predictors are insufficient.</s>
          <s>In Malaysia, only one publication describing burn injury from Malaysia was identified from our literature search which was conducted in a Malaysian university hospital.</s>
          <s>The retrospective study by <ref type="bibr">Chan et al.</ref> with 110 burn patients revealed that the major cause of death was due to inhalation injury and septicaemia from infected burn wounds <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The majority of the injured were males, and the aetiology of burn was mainly due to domestic-related injuries.</s>
          <s>Research in this area from government-owned hospitals where the majority of burn patients would be admitted due to better accessibility and affordable cost schemes for local Malaysians is not available.</s>
          <s>Therefore, this study is to investigate the risk factors of death with larger sample size and survival analysis to identify variables which may be utilized by local clinicians to determine the prognostic factors for burn death.</s>
          <s>The other objective of this study is to identify factors that may be predictors of burn mortality that may be used to triage patients into high risk for mortality in a local government-owned hospital burns unit.</s>
          <s>By identifying these predictors, we would try to understand and hence formulate treatment plans that may improve survivability in severe burn patients.</s>

          <s>Older age, a larger burn TBSA and inhalation injury are well-known predictors of burn mortality <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>

            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The result of our study is similar, which shows that the presence of inhalation injury and large TBSA burn is predictive of burn mortality.</s>
          <s>From our study, older age had a close to significant p value of 0.056 and odds ratio of 5 for burn mortality which showed a strong correlation with death.</s>
          <s>The main reason for the close to significant p value was probably due to the small sample population of elderly patients in our burn registry.</s>
          <s>Despite that, older age is a known mortality predictor of burn injury due to a decrease in immune function with physiological thinning of skin <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This contributes to more than a quarter of burn mortality in the entire burn population across all ages as reported by Santos et al. <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, the incidence of co-morbidities of hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary diseases rises within the ageing population.</s>
          <s>Co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a contributing factor leading to death in older patients <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Due to physiological factors of a weakened immune system, elderly burn-injured patients are likely to succumb to death from infective complications during hospitalizations or during the resuscitative phase <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, the moist and devitalized burn tissue provides a suitable medium for proliferation of bacteria <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17,</ref>
            <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Common bacterial isolate from blood cultures due to burned wound infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a prevalence rate of 8.4% <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ventilation period a (days) 10 The overall mortality rate in this current study is 12.2% which is considered acceptable from a burn centre from a developing nation.</s>
          <s>When compared to another developing nations, burn centre of India reported that the mortality rate goes up to 60.8% <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast to neighbouring Southeast Asia and developed country of Singapore, a lower mortality rate of 4.6% was reported in 2003 <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This data must be viewed with caution as the admission criteria might differ between centres which lead to a variation of the death rates.</s>
          <s>Due to better facilities and more bed availability, patients least serious burn injuries were also admitted and included in the study from Singapore which may account for the low mortality rate.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, it gives us an estimation and comparison of our capability in terms of death rates in managing severe burn patients.</s>
          <s>The burn admission criteria and referral criteria in our centre are identical.</s>
          <s>However, due to a limitation in bed availability, not all burn cases which fit the criteria of burn admission were admitted.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>From this study which was conducted in a Malaysian BICU, the predictors of mortality identified were TBSA &gt; 20%, early SIRS, mechanical ventilation and inhalation injury which were associated with poorer survival outcome.</s>
          <s>Early SIRS and mechanical ventilation were significant predictors of mortality.</s>
          <s>The immunological response differs from individual patients and influenced by the severity of the burn.</s>
          <s>SIRS on admission is an important predictor of death and may represent the severity of the burn injury.</s>
          <s>It is an inexpensive way of measuring the immunological response indirectly in comparison with costly laboratory and biochemical test specific for immunological markers of burn injuries.</s>
          <s>Patients who required mechanical ventilation were associated with mortality.</s>
          <s>This relates to the severity of associated lung injury sustained by individual patients due to the burn.</s>
          <s>Early SIRS and ventilated patients were novel predictors of death identified in this study.</s>
          <s>The use of these two predictors in addition to the universal well-known predictors of burn mortality (inhalation injury and TBSA burn) gives added variables for outcome prognostication and mortality risk counselling in severely burned patients.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, this study is important in Malaysia to identify the mortality risk factors of burn which may be used for local clinicians to stratify risk and predict outcome comparison for burn injuries.</s>
