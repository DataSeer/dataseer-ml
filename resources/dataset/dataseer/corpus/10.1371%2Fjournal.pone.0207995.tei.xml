        <p>
          <s>Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality rates.</s>
          <s>Globally, there were 10.4 million new (incident) TB cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2015.</s>
          <s>Kenya is among the 30 countries with the highest TB burden <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Delays in seeking TB treatment prolong the infectiousness of the disease, and therefore, early diagnosis of TB and rapid initiation of therapy is a prerequisite for the control of TB <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Studies have shown that delay in TB diagnosis and treatment is a critical problem in TB control programs which may have contributed to a high burden of TB in the African region <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>

            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As outlined in the WHO End TB Strategy, timely diagnosis and notification is one of the global priorities in the control of TB <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, early case detection not only depends on the diagnostic capacity of the health facility but also the health seeking practices of the patients.</s>
          <s>In Kenya, as in the case of other low-income countries, TB control programs rely heavily on passive case finding.</s>
          <s>The programs depend on individuals with TB to voluntarily get help, and therefore patients' health-seeking behaviour is critical to the success of these programs.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Health-seeking behaviour refers to the actions taken by individuals to enable them to treat or cope with their symptoms <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is a complicated process <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> that entails patients' interpretation of their symptoms and then making choices on treatment actions to adapt depending on the available options.</s>
          <s>Health-seeking behaviour is, therefore, a product of cognitive and non-cognitive factors that call for contextual analysis <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In West Pokot community, health care was pluralistic in nature with both the public and private health care system as well as traditional medicine.</s>
          <s>The traditional healer in this community was commonly referred to as Chepsakitian.</s>
          <s>According to the work of Kleinman on patients and healers in the context of culture, the health care system is pluralistic by nature with three closely overlapping sectors namely; the professional, the folk, and the popular sectors <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Kleinman contends that illness and disease is a social construction that is heavily influenced by the cultural beliefs of a community and that an individual's experiences, attitudes, and health beliefs all influence a person's health-seeking behaviour.</s>
          <s>Given the importance of culture in shaping patient decisionmaking, it is essential to understand the cultural and behavioural factors affecting TB control in order to inform patient-centred interventions in TB control <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Previous studies have documented health-seeking practices of TB patients in Kenya <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, none have focused on TB patients in the pastoralists communities.</s>
          <s>The seasonal movement in search of water and pasture for the livestock among nomadic pastoralists makes the population have the least access to health services which may lead to delay in TB diagnosis.</s>
          <s>Some of the documented factors leading to delay in TB diagnosis in Kenya are lack of finances to seek treatment and misinterpretation of early symptoms.</s>
          <s>Qualitative studies using grounded theory have not been applied to help understand the lived realities of TB patients in Kenya and specifically to understand their health care seeking behaviours.</s>
          <s>The purpose of this study is to understand experiences of health care seeking among TB patients and to generate a conceptual framework of factors leading to delay in TB diagnosis in West Pokot County.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Within Kenya's devolved health care system there are four levels of public health care facilities under the control of county governments.</s>
          <s>These are County referral hospitals, Sub-County hospitals, health centres and dispensaries.</s>
          <s>The health centres and dispensaries offer primary health services while the County hospitals and Sub-county hospitals offer curative services and have inpatient facilities and better diagnostic capacity.</s>
          <s>TB diagnosis in West Pokot County followed national guidelines <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref> where the standard test for TB was sputum smear microscopy.</s>
          <s>In Kenya, sputum microscopy services are available at the health centres, Sub-county hospitals, and County hospitals but not at the dispensaries.</s>
          <s>Clinical diagnosis was also made at the County referral hospital through the aid of chest radiograph.</s>
          <s>Diagnosis using cultures were not available.</s>
          <s>The hospitals mainly relied on microscopy for TB diagnosis, one X-ray machine and one Gene X-pert machine located at the County referral hospital.</s>

        <p>
          <s>This study took place in four hospitals offering TB services in West Pokot County, Kenya.</s>
          <s>The County is located in the Rift Valley and lies within Longitudes 34˚47´and 35˚49´East and Latitude 10˚10´and 30˚40´North.</s>
          <s>The County has a population of 512,690 people (2009 census) and an area of 9,169.4</s>
          <s>km2.</s>
          <s>The residents are mainly nomadic pastoralists living in the arid or semiarid part of the country.</s>
          <s>West Pokot County had a higher TB case notification rate of 225 per 100,000 population compared to the national rate of 217 per 100,000 population in the year 2013 <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>This was explorative qualitative research using a constructivist grounded theory approach <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The theory assumes a relativist ontology of multiple possible social realities and recognises that knowledge is co-constructed by the researcher and the research participants.</s>
          <s>Constructivist grounded theory aims to achieve an interpretive understanding of the research subjects' meanings <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Grounded theory was used to generate a model of the factors leading to TB diagnostic delays from the patients' perspective.</s>
          <s>The study adopted a constructivist approach where both deductive and inductive reasoning was used to interpret the participant's views and experiences <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Due to the infectious nature of the disease, patients who had not completed two weeks of treatment were excluded from the study.</s>
          <s>The researcher briefed the identified patients about the study by taking them through the informed consent form.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In-depth interviews.</s>
          <s>In-depth interviews (IDIs) were the primary method used to collect data on patient experiences and treatment pathways experienced during TB diagnosis.</s>
          <s>The interviews were conducted by the principal investigator and two research assistants.</s>
          <s>The research assistants were master's students who had training in research skills and the PI orientated them to the study objectives and the study tools.</s>

          <s>The interview guide included questions such as: "Tell me about the experience you have gone through since you started ailing from TB?

"Why do people delay before seeking TB treatment from the health facility?"</s>

        <p>
          <s>The interviews were conducted in Kiswahili language and were tape recorded and later transcribed verbatim <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The concept of data saturation <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> was used to guide the number of IDIs conducted.</s>

          <s>The Kiswahili tape-recorded interviews were translated into English and transcribed in English.</s>
          <s>The audio records were stored under key and lock, and the transcribed data was stored on a password-protected computer.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Focus group discussion.</s>
          <s>We conducted six focused group discussions (FGDs) (Three with male participants and three with female participants).</s>
          <s>Each group comprised of 6-10 participants.</s>
          <s>The FGDs were constituted based on gender.</s>
          <s>The principal investigator facilitated the discussion as the research assistant recorded notes during the discussion.</s>
          <s>An unstructured FGD guide was used to collect the data.</s>
          <s>The guide was revised in the subsequent FGDs to probe on new emerging themes.</s>
          <s>The guide included questions such as; "What are some of the traditional explanations to the causes of TB?" "Tell me about the experience TB patients go through to get TB diagnosis and treatment?"</s>
          <s>"What other forms of health care for TB patients is available in this community?"</s>

        <p>

          <s>Compared to individual interviews, group interaction allows participants to agree and disagree thereby stimulating richer responses which aid in revealing the respondent's real perceptions on the subject of interest <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Gathering ideas and cultural beliefs surrounding TB was possible through this method of data collection.</s>
          <s>Participants gave more information on cultural practices in TB diagnosis and treatment during the FGD compared to the IDI participants.</s>
          <s>FGD participants facilitated each other's memories and were more willing to report their experience of traditional medicine compared to IDI participants.</s>

          <s>Gender refers to the behaviour, expectations and roles within a social, economic and cultural context ascribed to being male or female.</s>
          <s>Evidence has shown that social construction of gender greatly influences the health-seeking behaviour <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the present study, masculinity was a major source of delay.</s>
          <s>Both genders confirmed that male patients compared to female patients, do not seek treatment from a health facility.</s>
          <s>The findings of longer patient delay among males are consistent with those of other studies done in Uganda <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref> and South Africa <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> , Malawi <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This may be a contributing factor to the higher burden of TB among males compared to females.</s>
          <s>A recent TB survey done in Kenya showed that the prevalence of TB was higher in males at 809 per 100,000 population compared to females at 359 per 100,000 <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Elsewhere empirical evidence has shown that there is a higher burden of TB among males which may be as a result of the interplay between a true higher incidence of the disease among men and their poor interaction with primary health care facilities as well as long delays in seeking treatment for various illnesses including TB <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the Pokot community, men viewed themselves as strong and seeking treatment promptly was viewed as an act of weakness.</s>
          <s>This form of masculinity where men are viewed as without emotions and lacking vulnerability is culturally embedded.</s>
          <s>It leads to delay in men seeking health care and as a result being underserved by the health care system <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48,</ref>

          <s>Finally, structural factors such as inadequate diagnostic capacity, distant facilities and lack of finances resulted in a delayed diagnosis.</s>
          <s>Poor diagnostic capacity led to misdiagnosis which was a hindrance to timely diagnosis.</s>
          <s>This could be because the standard diagnostic techniques for TB in Kenya is by sputum examination and cultures which are not sensitive enough to capture disease in the early stages.</s>
          <s>Since the discovery of TB in 1882 sputum microscopy has remained the cornerstone for TB diagnosis in low and middle-income countries <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Chest X-ray offers a fast and sensitive test for diagnoses of TB.</s>
          <s>However, it requires specialized manpower and therefore not available in the primary health care facilities.</s>
          <s>More sensitive tests such as radiography, a molecular diagnosis that can capture TB cases early enough are expensive and inadequate.</s>

          <s>However, in the current study distant facilities and lack of finances were conceptualized as structural factors where the health care system should be the point of intervention.</s>

          <s>The strength of this study is in the use of two methods of data collection.</s>
          <s>While IDIs allowed for exploration of the detailed experience of each patient health-seeking pathway, the FGDs were helpful in gathering rich discussion on the cultural beliefs surrounding TB diagnosis and treatment.</s>
          <s>FGDs allowed for a wider scope of understanding as the participants facilitated each other in the discussions <ref type="bibr">[64]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One limitation of the study is the use of IDIs to study patients' lived experiences of seeking TB diagnosis and treatment.</s>
          <s>The method was not sufficient to yield a detailed account of the patients' experiences.</s>
          <s>A method such as ethnography which does not focus on reports about activities but is driven by the interest of being there and observing events as they occur <ref type="bibr">[65]</ref> would have been more appropriate.</s>
          <s>Secondly, the study findings are based on a sample of patients who were eventually able to access treatment.</s>
          <s>This excludes the views of TB patients who may have experienced delays and were unable to access TB treatment.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study showed that pathway to TB diagnosis and treatment was long and frustrating and caused patients' suffering.</s>
          <s>Approaches geared towards timely diagnosis are recommended to avoid the consequences of the pathway of delay in TB diagnosis which includes increased disease transmission.</s>
          <s>There is a need to improve timely diagnosis through scaling up diagnostic capacity.</s>
          <s>Similarly, the health system should decentralise TB services as much as possible to increase accessibility and offer free diagnostic services.</s>
          <s>The TB program should also scale up health education to improve TB awareness in the community.</s>
          <s>Innovative approaches such as mobile clinics as well as intensive case finding should be incorporated in the TB program in the pastoralist communities.</s>
