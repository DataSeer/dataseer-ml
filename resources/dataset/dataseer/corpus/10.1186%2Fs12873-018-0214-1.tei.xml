        <p>
          <s>Survival rates following out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are disappointingly low: analysis of 70 studies documented survival to hospital discharge in just 7.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7-8.4)</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Death on the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually caused by withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) because of perceived severe neurological injury <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> Although the delivery of oxygen to tissues is essential for human life, there is evidence that high oxygen concentrations after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can be harmful.</s>
          <s>This is probably due to the many reactive oxygen species that are created during reperfusion <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Administration of high concentrations of oxygen has been shown to be harmful in stroke, myocardial infarction and in neonatal resuscitation <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> Animal data indicate that avoidance of hyperoxia, particularly during the first hour after ROSC, reduces brain injury <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Large human registry studies have demonstrated that normoxia in the first 24 h following a cardiac arrest is associated with improved outcome compared with either hyperoxia or hypoxia, <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> whilst animal data suggest that most benefit from the prevention of hyperoxia is gained during the first hour following ROSC <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One small clinical study that compared administration of 30% oxygen with 100% oxygen after OHCA showed lower neuron specific enolase (NSE -a marker of neurological injury) values in one subgroup of patients who were allocated to 30% oxygen and not cooled <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In most emergency medical services (EMS) systems, the first hour following ROSC will be prehospital.</s>
          <s>We therefore designed a trial to examine the feasibility of administering titrated oxygen versus 100% oxygen for the first hour following ROSC to see if paramedics are able to safely titrate oxygen and measure corresponding oxygen saturations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our aims were to assess the feasibility of completing a cluster-randomised clinical trial to determine if titrated oxygen therapy (target blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) 94-98%) for 1 h after ROSC improves outcome compared with the use of 100% oxygen during this hour.</s>

        <head>Summary of principal findings</head>
        <p>
          <s>We have shown that amongst UK paramedics it is potentially feasible to perform a trial of titrated oxygen in the first hour following ROSC after OHCA.</s>
          <s>Recruitment of paramedics can be difficult in the UK setting.</s>
          <s>Accurate recording of SpO 2 values is challenging or impossible in some patients, and measures must be taken to avoid hypoxia in these individuals.</s>
          <s>Paramedics are willing and able to follow an algorithm for oxygen titration.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the intervention arm, paramedics were able to titrate the inspired oxygen concentration in 72% of eligible patients.</s>
          <s>These findings improve on a previous study to examine pre-hospital oxygen titration, which analysed data from 17 patients in New Zealand and concluded that safe delivery of titrated oxygen therapy in the pre-hospital period was not feasible <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> Similar trials include a small pre-hospital feasibility study of 28 cardiac arrest patients who were allocated randomly to one of two groups immediately after ROSC <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Group A received 30% oxygen and group B received 100% oxygen.</s>
          <s>The study concluded that patients who received 30% oxygen had acceptable oxygen saturations (although the inspired oxygen concentration had to be increased in 5 of the 14 patients in the 30% group to maintain an SpO 2 ≥ 95%).</s>
          <s>The study demonstrated feasibility, however a larger trial did not follow.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A second randomised trial conducted in Australia documented widely scattered blood oxygen saturation values that were downloaded from pulse oximeter monitors; consequently, the study was discontinued early <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Following the completion of our trial a further feasibility study has been published, <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> showing that a titrated oxygen strategy is possible.</s>
          <s>Arterial blood oxygen desaturations were more common in the titrated group, however the findings were used to support the case for a large randomised controlled trial.</s>
          <s>Our findings also suggest that oxygen saturation can be difficult to measure in the prehospital environment, and that arterial blood oxygen desaturations occur, though patient characteristics, paramedic training, organisation of emergency medical systems and distances travelled all differ between the UK and Australia.</s>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Limitations of the trial</head>
        <p>
          <s>We relied on paramedic reporting of pulse oximeter oxygen saturation readings and successful oxygen titration, rather than objective measures, since at the time of the trial automated recording of oxygen saturations was not available in our EMS.</s>
          <s>Also, we did not provide a standardised definition of 'reliable' pulse oximetry readings, and so there is likely to have been some variability in interpretation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We used a cluster-randomised design by paramedic, which meant that the individuals delivering the intervention and reporting some of the outcomes were not blinded.</s>
          <s>Paramedics were not selected, but volunteered, and this may reduce the generalizability of our findings when applied to all paramedics.</s>
          <s>Poor recruitment of volunteer paramedics remains an issue for future trials.</s>
          <s>However, we required only a few individuals and so did not maximise our recruitment strategy; the same ambulance service recently recruited many more paramedics for a considerably larger randomised controlled trial <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our opinion, individual patient randomisation and paramedic blinding are not practical within UK EMS systems during time critical interventions such as cardiac arrest, and cluster randomisation is the only feasible approach.</s>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Future trials</head>
        <p>
          <s>We have collected relevant data, however the required sample size for any future study will depend on the chosen primary outcome.</s>
          <s>The relatively few eligible patients, along with incomplete initiation of the intervention and some missing data elements, makes a highly clinically relevant outcome such as mortality very challenging to achieve.</s>
          <s>A more realistic approach might be to evaluate serum NSE values as a measure of neurological injury <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accurate SpO 2 measurement and automatic recording is also crucial to further trials in this area.</s>
          <s>The inability to blind paramedics to the intervention is also a limitation.</s>
          <s>Future studies would benefit from a more objective and reliable method of measuring tissue and brain oxygenation, although this can be difficult in a prehospital environment <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>We have shown that it may be feasible to complete a randomised trial of titrated versus unrestricted oxygen in the first hour after ROSC following OHCA in the UK.</s>
          <s>However, the relatively few eligible patients and incomplete initiation of the allocated intervention are challenges to future research.</s>
          <s>More feasibility work is required to explore the best way of addressing this important research question.</s>
