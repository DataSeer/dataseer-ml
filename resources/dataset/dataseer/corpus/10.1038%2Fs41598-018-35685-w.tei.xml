            <s>China's reported cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and AIDS increased from over 50000 in 2011 to more than 130000 in 2017, while AIDS related search indices on Baidu from 2.1 million to 3.7 million in the same time periods.</s>
            <s>In China, people seek AIDS related knowledge from Baidu which one of the world's largest search engine.</s>
            <s>We study the relationship of national HIV surveillance data with the Baidu index (BDI) and use it to monitor AIDS epidemic and inform targeted intervention.</s>
            <s>After screening keywords and making index composition, we used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling.</s>
            <s>The most correlated search engine query data was obtained by using ARIMA with external variables (ARIMAX) model for epidemic prediction.</s>
            <s>A significant correlation between monthly HIV/AIDS report cases and Baidu Composite Index (r = 0.845, P &lt; 0.001) was observed using time series plot.</s>
            <s>Compared with the ARIMA model based on AIDS surveillance data, the ARIMAX model with Baidu Composite Index had the minimal an Akaike information criterion (AIC, 839.42) and the most exact prediction (MAPE of 6.11%).</s>
            <s>We showed that there are close correlations of the same trends between BDI and HIV/AIDS reports cases for both increasing and decreasing AIDS epidemic.</s>
            <s>Therefore, the Baidu search query data may be a good useful indicator for reliably monitoring and predicting HIV/AIDS epidemic in China.</s>

          <p>
            <s>Since the first AIDS case was reported in 1981, the virus has caused more than 60 million infections and more than 30 million deaths worldwide, making it the greatest threat to human health 1 .</s>
            <s>The severity of the AIDS epidemic and its perniciousness is also a social problem that needs an urgent solution.</s>
            <s>In recent years, the epidemic pattern of HIV/AIDS in China has gradually diversified and the scope of surveillance is continuously expanding.</s>
            <s>The traditional way of monitoring disease is to count the number of cases over a period of time by setting up sentinel hospitals throughout the country.</s>
            <s>A more modern way of monitoring diseases is to access the monitoring data that is released by the health department after sorting out the statistics.</s>
            <s>This method is collected by artificial means, covering a large area and for a period of time, which usually takes a lot of manpower, materials and time.</s>
            <s>Moreover, some HIV-infected patients may not be willing to report their symptoms to a doctor because of private issues and official data are usually released after two weeks of reported illness 2 .</s>
            <s>This lag in AIDS data collection and reporting is an impediment to the control of the epidemic.</s>

            <s>The Internet search engine has become an important platform for public access to information as well as data archive, with the latter serving as research source in various disciplines.</s>
            <s>Research objects based on Internet data have not only been developed in the fields of economy, finance, and marketing such as products sales, trend of gas prices and stock market 3-5 , but also in medical research and epidemic analysis of infectious diseases.</s>
            <s>It can provide health authorities with important information regarding the emergence and spread of diseases in the city to complement traditional epidemic surveillance systems 6 .</s>

          <s>Spatial difference analysis of the data is also performed to find the differences in spatial distribution of the AIDS-related search data.</s>

          <s>And the research on Internet Surveillance and Analysis Methods for Conventional Epidemics has achieved good development in various countries.</s>
          <s>In this study, six categories of 50 related keyword search indexes were obtained from Baidu Index.</s>
          <s>Among them, the keywords searched for the general and epidemiologic categories were higher than other keywords, and the simple keywords such as "AIDS", "Prostitute", "HIV" and "AIDS Symptoms" were more frequently searched than other keywords.</s>
          <s>This is because people usually pay more attention to the vocabulary of AIDS etiologies and symptoms, and they are also good at searching with simple keywords.</s>
          <s>When cross-correlation analysis was performed to observe lag, no significant delays were observed in each keyword.</s>
          <s>The national Baidu composite index was then obtained by adding the sum of the weight of the filtered keywords.</s>

          <s>The increase awareness of the AIDS epidemics causes the surge in the search for AIDS-related information and the search index to inflate.</s>

          <s>As a result, the number of search requests for the population increased, but the actual AIDS epidemic has not surged.</s>
          <s>In the correlation analysis, we found that in the regions where the AIDS epidemic has been increasing year after year, various types of keywords are related to the actual number of cases in these regions.</s>
          <s>In areas where the epidemic is declining yearly however, the correlation with the actual number of cases is low, and there is only a weak correlation between the therapeutic and diagnostic keywords.</s>

          <s>Also, in the comparison of keyword search intensity in various provinces, the epidemic and search volume in Sichuan Province and Chongqing City are relatively high, but the search intensity of Internet users in the province is lower than those in Guangxi and Xinjiang where the epidemic situation is similar.</s>

            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, the keywords used in this study only represent the search behavior of persons from 2011 to 2017, and cannot guarantee consistent and effective long-term prediction in the future.</s>
          <s>In addition, although the selected keywords capture the trend of outbreak data very well, there still may be some which increased as a result of social festivals, events and media reports.</s>
          <s>So, it is necessary to add or delete the corresponding keywords in the future and to ensure that there is a large correlation between the composite index and the actual number of cases.</s>
          <s>Thirdly, the use of Internet search data to assist epidemic surveillance depends on the amount of Internet access, which is uneven throughout China.</s>
          <s>The population sizes of different regions are also different.</s>
          <s>According to the latest Internet penetration rate of 55.8% released by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) in 2017, the rural Internet penetration rate reached only 35.4%.</s>
          <s>Finally, although we found that search engine data have spatial differences and there are also deviations in provincial network data.</s>
          <s>However, the selected provinces are still insufficient, as well as not found a pattern on different provincial relationships.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the ARIMAX model is based on nationwide data, does not take into account geographical disparities within the province.</s>
          <s>Further studies to account for the search index from a larger number of provinces and regions may be more effective.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, the keywords for AIDS used in this study can provide some reference value for the collection, screening, analysis and forecasting process of search engine data.</s>
          <s>Moreover, the prediction model based on Baidu Index can accurately predict infectious disease outbreaks.</s>
