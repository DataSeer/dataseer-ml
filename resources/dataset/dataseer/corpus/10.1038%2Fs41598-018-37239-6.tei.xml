            <s>Carcinogens often generate mutable DNA lesions that contribute to cancer and aging.</s>
            <s>However, the chemical structure of tumorigenic DNA lesions formed by acetaldehyde remains unknown, although it has long been considered an environmental mutagen in alcohol, tobacco, and food.</s>
            <s>Here, we identify an aldehyde-induced DNA lesion, forming an intrastrand crosslink between adjacent guanine bases, but not in single guanine bases or in other combinations of nucleotides.</s>
            <s>The GG intrastrand crosslink exists in equilibrium in the presence of aldehyde, and therefore it has not been detected or analyzed in the previous investigations.</s>
            <s>The newly identified GG intrastrand crosslinks might explain the toxicity and mutagenicity of acetaldehyde in DNA metabolism.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Acetaldehyde is a small, highly reactive compound that occurs naturally in various plants, ripe fruits, and vegetables, and is a key raw material in a wide range of chemical products.</s>
            <s>Importantly, humans appear to be constantly and unavoidably exposed to acetaldehyde, especially from alcohol, cigarettes, sugars, and polluted air 1 .</s>
            <s>Acetaldehyde is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as having sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans 1 .</s>
            <s>Indeed, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity have been repeatedly demonstrated in cells and experimental animals 2-4 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Acetaldehyde is thought to cause a variety of DNA lesions in living cells 5,6 , but paradoxically, the major acetaldehydeinduced DNA lesions have very little effect on replication, because DNA polymerases bypass them in a nonmutagenic manner 7 .</s>
            <s>For example, acetaldehyde reacts with deoxyguanosine to form N 2 -ethylidenedeoxyguanosine, a type of Schiff base adduct 8,9 .</s>
            <s>This adduct is relatively unstable but abundant in the human liver, at about 0.1 per 10 6 nucleotides, even in the absence of exposure to exogenous acetaldehyde 8,10 , suggesting that acetaldehyde is endogenously produced from normal metabolism.</s>
            <s>N 2 -ethylidenedeoxyguanosine can be stabilized by chemical reduction of the Schiff base to N 2 -ethyldeoxyguanosine 8 , which is then typically used as a model adduct in research.</s>
            <s>DNA repair pathways for these lesions have not been found 11 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>One hint for the identity of mutagenic lesions caused by acetaldehyde comes from a test of mutagenicity, in which a plasmid containing a selectable drug resistance gene is incubated with acetaldehyde in vitro and then transfected into human cells.</s>
            <s>This revealed an increase of GG to TT mutations in NER-deficient human XP cells 12 .</s>
            <s>However, the structure, physiological significance, and tumorigenicity of acetaldehyde-induced DNA lesions that elicit such mutations are unknown.</s>
            <s>We report here that acetaldehyde forms covalent guanine dimers.</s>
            <s>These lesions are specifically formed in adjacent deoxyguanosine residues, but not in single deoxyguanosine residues, or in deoxyadenosine, deoxycytosine, and thymidine residues.</s>
            <s>Detailed analysis revealed that acetaldehyde forms reversible intrastrand crosslinks in GG.</s>
            <s>These lesions are unstable, and hence have not been previously observed, but are likely to be toxic and mutagenic.</s>
            <s>We propose that these GG lesions may account for the apparent carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde in humans, and our understanding of these lesions may help develop new strategies to prevent alcohol-related cancer.</s>

            <s>Thus, a 15-mer synthetic oligomer with GG (oligoGG, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref> upper panel) was incubated with acetaldehyde at 37 °C for 1 h, and analyzed by HPLC.</s>

          <s>Strikingly, very little modified product was observed <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1b,c)</ref> , indicating that acetaldehyde only reacts with GG sequences.</s>
          <s>Acetaldehyde also did not appear to react with oligonucleotides containing GA or AG ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1a)</ref> , GC or CG ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1b)</ref> , or GTG or GTTG ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we found that adducts were not formed under our experimental conditions even in GG dimers ( <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b)</ref> , suggesting that acetaldehyde reacts only with GG sequences present in longer sequences.</s>
          <s>However, extended reaction times with oligoGG ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> ) also did not increase the amount of adducts formed after 1 h, suggesting that the reaction is reversible and reaches equilibrium.</s>
          <s>We then investigated whether acetaldehyde reacts with complementary oligonucleotides that contain a GG site in one strand ( <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>As before, adducts were clearly formed in single-stranded oligonucleotides containing GG (oligoGG2, <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3a</ref> upper panel, peak iii), whereas broad peaks were observed in complementary strands (anti-oligoGG2, <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3b upper panel)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, adducts were formed in oligoGG2 annealed to its complementary strand (ds-oligoGG2, <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 3c upper panel)</ref> , indicating that acetaldehyde reacts with both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA.</s>

          <s>Acetaldehyde has been reported to produce interstrand crosslinks, especially in cells deficient in the Fanconi anemia pathway, which are notably hypersensitive to acetaldehyde <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, we found that acetaldehyde-induced adducts were not formed under our experimental conditions in double-stranded oligonucleotides with a predicted GG interstrand crosslinking site ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 4)</ref> , implying that acetaldehyde does not form interstrand crosslinks in this case.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition, we investigated whether a detectable human DNA glycosylase of BER might catalyze the cleavage in acetaldehyde-treated oligonucleotides containing GG using normal human cell extracts <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> .</s>
          <s>After incubation with HeLa cell extracts, no indications of any DNA glycosylase active on acetaldehyde-treated oligonucleotides were obtained under our experimental conditions, whereas DNA strand cleavage of a control oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue was detected ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 5</ref> ).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Acetaldehyde-induced DNA lesions are reversible.</s>
          <s>We attempted to purify the product formed by acetaldehyde and oligoGG to determine its structure.</s>
          <s>Because the boiling point of acetaldehyde is 20.2 °C, it was easily removed from reaction mixtures by SpeedVac.</s>
          <s>However, removal of acetaldehyde unexpectedly reduced the amount of adducts (peak ii) and increased the amount of the initial substrate (peak i, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 6</ref> ), even when stored at −20 °C for 24 h ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 6</ref> ).</s>
          <s>This observation indicated that adducts reverted to the unreacted state in the absence of acetaldehyde.</s>
          <s>Indeed, the adducts completely disappeared after incubation at 75 °C or 95 °C for 5 min <ref type="figure">(Supplementary Fig. 7</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The reversion of the adducts was analyzed in detail under physiological conditions after the removal of acetaldehyde by SpeedVac <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1e</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Upon incubation of the mixture at 37 °C at pH 7.0, decrease in the adducts and increase in the original oligonucleotide were observed <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1f)</ref> with a time constant of 31.6 ± 2.3 min <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1g)</ref> , and the reaction reached at equilibrium after 120 min.</s>
          <s>These results highlight the instability of adducts formed by acetaldehyde, and suggest that the reaction between oligonucleotides and acetaldehyde is reversible.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We hypothesized that the adduct is unstable because of imine structures formed between acetaldehyde and NH 2 in deoxyguanosine.</s>
          <s>Hence, oligos that reacted with acetaldehyde were purified by gel filtration and immediately incubated for 30 min with NaBH 3 CN, a strong reducing agent, to isolate a stable structure.</s>
          <s>Samples were then observed for another 1-2 h to monitor stability <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1h)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Notably, incubation with NaBH 3 CN for 30 min-2 h resolved the adduct peak (peak ii) into peaks iv and v <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1i</ref> ).</s>

          <s>These results suggest that peaks iv and v are somehow chemically different, even though they each contain N 2 -ethyldeoxyguanosine.

          <s>As noted, reduction of acetaldehyde-reacted oligoGG with NaBH 3 CN produced oligonucleotides containing one N 2 -ethyldeoxyguanosine at the 5′ or 3′ end of a GG sequence.</s>
          <s>However, products with two N 2 -ethyldeoxyguanosines at the GG site were not observed, suggesting that acetaldehyde may have formed intrastrand crosslinks that were subsequently reduced by NaBH 3 CN.</s>
          <s>To test this possibility, we analyzed acetaldehyde reaction mixtures by MALDI-TOF-MS.</s>
          <s>The NH 2 group in deoxyguanosine seems to be important in forming such a structure.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we tested whether acetaldehyde generates intrastrand crosslinks in hypoxanthine, a guanine without NH 2 <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Reactions with oligoGG, oligoGI, and oligoIG <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">(Fig. 3c)</ref> indicated that NH 2 in deoxyguanosine is essential for crosslinking.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>In this study, we found that acetaldehyde specifically reacts with single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotides containing GG, but not TT, GT, GA, AG, GC, or CG.</s>
          <s>However, the lesions formed are unstable, and produce two stable products containing N 2 -ethyldeoxyguanosine only when reduced with NaBH 3 CN.</s>
          <s>Finally, mass analysis revealed that acetaldehyde forms GG intrastrand crosslinks, a new type of DNA lesion that is uniquely reversible.</s>
          <s>Chemical features.</s>
          <s>The putative mechanism of intrastrand-crosslinking is illustrated in <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this reaction, an imine is formed between acetaldehyde and the amino group of one of the guanine bases, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the adjacent guanine base.</s>
          <s>Imine formation is known to be reversible in aqueous solutions, and <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> ,f, and <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 6</ref> demonstrate that crosslinking after imine formation is also in equilibrium and splits the product into imine and amine intermediates.</s>
          <s>This mechanism is supported by mass spectrometry <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">(Figs 2 and 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Each of the two products obtained in the presence of NaBH 4 contained an ethyl group, which was presumably formed by the reduction of the imine intermediate, whereas the crosslinked product was successfully detected only in the absence of reducing agent.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, intrastrand crosslinking was not observed by Wang et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> , who investigated interstrand crosslinking by acetaldehyde, likely because the reversibly intrastrand-crosslinked products were too labile to be detected.</s>
          <s>In addition, we believe that intrastrand crosslinking is more likely to occur than interstrand crosslinking, which requires two acetaldehyde molecules, and is rate-limited by the addition of the second acetaldehyde, as also observed during aldol condensation in alkaline conditions.</s>
          <s>Many examples of imine formation between aldehydes and amino groups in guanine have been reported <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>
          <s>We note that the amino group in 2′-deoxyguanosine has a lower pK a value (2.5) than 2′-deoxyadenosine and 2′-deoxycytidine (3.8 and 4.3, respectively) <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the nucleophilicity of a more basic compound is lower than that of a less basic group in an aqueous solution due to hydration, imine formation is more favorable at a guanine base than at others.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, we assume that consecutive reactions at GG sites stabilize the resulting adduct, as intrastrand crosslinks were observed only at such sites ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1)</ref> , and not in isolated G sites ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b)</ref> .</s>

          <s>DNA repair and mutagenesis.</s>
          <s>Acetaldehyde-induced GG intrastrand crosslinks are most likely repaired by the versatile NER pathway.</s>
          <s>Indeed, an intrastrand-crosslinked GG lesion probably resembles a UV-induced TT dimer and thus distorts the DNA helix.</s>
          <s>Consequently, such a distortion can only be resolved by NER, which primarily repairs bulky helix-distorting damage from environmental mutagens, and not by BER, which repairs non-bulky and non-distorting DNA modifications from endogenous and some chemical carcinogens.</s>
          <s>Indeed, cleavage by DNA glycosylase during BER would not remove this lesion, because guanine would remain attached to another guanine even after cleavage of the glycosyl bond.</s>
          <s>In contrast, Matsuda et al. previously reported that acetaldehyde-treated DNA increases GG-to-TT mutations in NER-deficient cells, which are also more sensitive to acetaldehyde than NER-proficient cells <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12</ref> .</s>
          <s>And an acetaldehyde-induced GG intrastrand crosslink also resemble a cis-diammineplatinum(II)-induced GG intrastrand crosslink that are repaired by NER, in chemical GG interstrand crosslink products <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, since many distorted DNA lesions (e.g. a UV-induced TT dimer and a cis-diammineplatinum(II)-induced GG intrastrand crosslink) have been shown to block transcription, an acetaldehyde-induced GG intrastrand crosslink might induce a transcription arrest by RNA polymerase II which is trigger of transcription-coupled NER <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, to demonstrate this directly, oligonucleotides containing acetaldehyde-induced crosslinks would have to be purified and assayed by in vitro NER using human cell extracts.</s>
          <s>Although such experiments are challenging to execute because of the chemical instability of these lesions, there might be the possibility to observe the biological effects of the lesions using a structurally stable analog of intrastrand crosslink lesion.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Stepwise reaction of two molecules of acetaldehyde with DNA in vivo 8 produces two other possible DNA adducts: R-and S-α-CH 3 -γ-OH-1,N 2 -propano-2′-deoxyguanosine <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>
          <s>These adducts are thought to be repaired by NER, and to induce G-to-T transversion 5-10% of the time, although Hoogsteen base pairing with cytosine is also possible <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition, these DNA lesions may react with deoxyguanosine on the opposite strand to form an interstrand crosslink, or with protein to form a DNA-protein crosslink.</s>
          <s>To resolve the spectrum of structures formed, repair pathways for such lesions are probably complex and versatile.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> ; as a result, cells from patients with XP are hypersensitive to UV light.</s>
          <s>NER-deficient XPA cells were also previously reported to be more sensitive to acetaldehyde than normal cells, although XPA knockout chicken DT40 cells were only slightly more sensitive than control cells <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results imply that NER resolves acetaldehyde-induced GG intrastrand crosslinks.</s>
          <s>In any case, even low concentrations of acetaldehyde, such as those typically found in the human body, may induce genomic DNA lesions because the reaction is reversible.</s>
          <s>Thus, similar to cyclopurine lesions formed during oxidative stress, this lesion may be an endogenous DNA lesion that accelerates neurodegeneration in XP.</s>

        <head>XP and Fanconi anemia. NER is impaired in XP</head>
        <p>
          <s>Fanconi anemia is an inherited genomic instability disorder caused by mutations in genes regulating replication-dependent removal of interstrand DNA crosslinks <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s>
          <s>Accordingly, in response to genotoxicity, the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway is thought to coordinate a complex mechanism combining elements of homologous recombination, NER, and translesion DNA synthesis.</s>
          <s>Notably, cells from patients with Fanconi anemia are hypersensitive to exogenous interstrand crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin, as well as to endogenous acetaldehyde <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> , which we found to form intrastrand crosslinks rather than interstrand crosslinks.</s>
          <s>Nevertheless, all types of lesions may block DNA synthesis during replication, thereby causing spontaneous cell death.</s>
          <s>Indeed, cells from patients with Fanconi anemia are sensitive to not only crosslinking agents but also noncrosslinking agents <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> , UV 27 , camptothecin <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28</ref> , and etoposide 29 in some cases.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Intriguingly, recent genome-wide analysis of sequence signatures indicates that CC-to-AA mutations are associated with cancer, as are GG lesions <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>This survey also suggests that mutations are induced on transcribed strands, and are linked to transcription-coupled NER.</s>
          <s>Thus, we propose that the GG-to-TT mutations observed in cancers may in part be correlated with acetaldehyde-induced intrastrand crosslinks.</s>
