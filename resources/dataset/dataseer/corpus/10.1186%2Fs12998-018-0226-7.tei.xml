            <s>Background: Manipulation-induced hypoalgesia (MIH) represents reduced pain sensitivity following joint manipulation, and has been documented in various populations.</s>
            <s>It is unknown, however, whether MIH following high-velocity low-amplitude spinal manipulative therapy is a specific and clinically relevant treatment effect.</s>
            <s>Methods: This systematic critical review with meta-analysis investigated changes in quantitative sensory testing measures following high-velocity low-amplitude spinal manipulative therapy in musculoskeletal pain populations, in randomised controlled trials.</s>
            <s>Our objectives were to compare changes in quantitative sensory testing outcomes after spinal manipulative therapy vs. sham, control and active interventions, to estimate the magnitude of change over time, and to determine whether changes are systemic or not.</s>
            <s>Results: Fifteen studies were included.</s>
            <s>Thirteen measured pressure pain threshold, and four of these were shamcontrolled.</s>
            <s>Change in pressure pain threshold after spinal manipulative therapy compared to sham revealed no significant difference.</s>
            <s>Pressure pain threshold increased significantly over time after spinal manipulative therapy (0. 32 kg/cm 2 , CI 0.22-0.42),</s>
            <s>which occurred systemically.</s>
            <s>There were too few studies comparing to other interventions or for other types of quantitative sensory testing to make robust conclusions about these.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is commonly utilised by patients seeking relief from spinal pain symptoms <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the neurophysiologic mechanisms of SMT and the reasons for positive clinical outcomes in some patients is poorly understood.</s>
          <s>Manipulation-induced hypoalgesia (MIH), a reduction in pain sensitivity following SMT, is one possible explanation.</s>
          <s>To date, much MIH research has been performed on asymptomatic populations and its clinical relevance is unknown.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Experimental pain research commonly involves quantitative sensory testing (QST).</s>
          <s>QST comprises a controlled nociceptive stimulus and standardised psycho-physical measurements of the resulting pain <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most widely used QST type in manual therapy research is pressure pain threshold (PPT, which is the detection threshold for deep pain from pressure), though temporal summation (the change in subjective pain intensity during repeated nociceptive stimuli, typically using heat or pinprick), thermal pain detection thresholds, and others, are also used.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is known that many people with chronic pain have increased pain sensitivity in a variety of QST measures <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3,</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Clinically, there is poor correlation between pain detection thresholds and subjective pain outcomes (pain intensity and disability), but fair correlations with subjective pain outcomes for pain tolerance thresholds and temporal summation evoked by heat <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>SMT encompasses a variety of techniques, and sometimes mobilisation is included in the definition.</s>
          <s>For this review, we are specifically concerned with high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) SMT, which involves a rapid, controlled manual thrust targeting specific spinal joints <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The thrust is often accompanied by a "cracking" sound (termed cavitation) <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , though hypoalgesia appears to occur regardless of a cavitation <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the following, SMT will refer to HVLA SMT unless specified differently.</s>
          <s>The mechanism for clinical pain relief associated with SMT is not well understood, though changes in QST measures may offer insight into this.</s>
          <s>Bialosky et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> argue that the mechanical input of SMT (and manual therapy in general) leads to a neurophysiologic cascade.</s>
          <s>This may involve peripheral factors (e.g.</s>
          <s>changes in inflammatory mediators and nociceptors), spinal factors (e.g.</s>
          <s>altered dorsal horn neuron excitability), and supraspinal factors (e.g.</s>
          <s>periaqueductal gray activation).</s>
          <s>Furthermore, it is widely accepted that at least some of the pain relieving effect of SMT is attributable to placebo and contextual factors <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Previous research</head>
        <p>
          <s>Four previous systematic reviews on the topic of MIH conclude that SMT (and mobilisation) leads to increased PPTs (decreased pressure sensitivity) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One concludes that this increase in PPT was significant compared to sham in asymptomatic populations <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , and the others do not make conclusions on this topic.</s>
          <s>A variety of other types of QST measures may also respond to SMT <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , though results for temperature-induced pain are mixed <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is no clear consensus in these reviews regarding whether changes in QST occur only locally, regionally, or systemically in relation to the site of SMT.</s>
          <s>None of these reviews, however, specifically investigate changes in QST measures after HVLA SMT in musculoskeletal pain populations only.</s>

        <head>Rationale and research questions</head>
        <p>
          <s>Since previous reviews do not adequately address whether MIH occurs in symptomatic populations, and the MIH literature has expanded significantly in recent years, we concluded that an up to date systematic critical review with meta-analysis was warranted.</s>
          <s>Our overarching aim was to investigate the literature on how HVLA SMT affects short-term QST measures in musculoskeletal pain populations, with the following specific research questions:</s>

          <s>We considered any year of publication, but arbitrarily limited studies to those with at least 10 participants per group in order to reduce the effect of spurious findings from particularly small studies.</s>
          <s>At least one group in each study had to receive HVLA SMT, not combined with any other therapy.</s>
          <s>SMT could be compared to any other active intervention, sham, or control.</s>
          <s>Studies had to measure at least one type of QST as a primary or secondary outcome measure, before and after the intervention on the same day.</s>

        <p>
          <s>To our knowledge this is the first systematic review studying the literature on changes in QST measures after HVLA SMT in populations with musculoskeletal pain.</s>
          <s>Our results indicate that PPT increases systemically over time following SMT in musculoskeletal pain populations in the short term.</s>
          <s>However, there was no significant difference when compared to sham manipulation.</s>
          <s>Based on a few studies, there were also no differences between SMT and control or other interventions, which included mobilisation, exercise, and other types of SMT.</s>
          <s>There were too few studies investigating other types of QST to make robust conclusions.</s>

        <p>
          <s>There is low quality evidence that SMT does not provide an increase in PPT beyond that observed after a sham manipulation.</s>
          <s>With a sample size of 92 and only three studies included in the SMT versus sham meta-analysis, it is possible that the meta-analysis is underpowered and at risk of producing a false negative result.</s>
          <s>We also acknowledge that the sham manipulations could technically be considered as low-grade sustained mobilisations.</s>
          <s>It is therefore possible that they may elicit a neurophysiological response in their own right, which would confound the results.</s>
          <s>However, in three of four sham groups there was no increase in PPT after intervention, suggesting minimal placebo effect occurred in these studies.</s>
          <s>Based on these findings, it is difficult to speculate on whether the significant change over time after SMT observed in the included studies is due to treatment-specific effects or non-specific effects (expectation and contextual factors involved in the delivery of SMT).</s>
          <s>The systemic nature of the change over time would suggest that a central and systemic hypoalgesic mechanism may be at play, rather than local or regional.</s>
          <s>It is also important to note that few studies measure beyond 5-10 min post-intervention, hence we could only investigate very short term change in PPT, further limiting the clinical applicability of our results.</s>
          <s>Heterogeneity in the meta-analyses was high, reflecting the significant between-study variation (in populations, QST locations, and interventions).</s>
          <s>This suggests that there are real differences in effect sizes between studies.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Our review agrees with prior reviews on the topic of MIH for PPT change over time, and builds upon their conclusions by offering support for the systemic nature of the change <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our SMT versus sham results are in contrast to the review by Honoré et al. <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> , which concluded in favour of a specific treatment effect in asymptomatic populations.</s>
          <s>In attempting to compare our meta-analysis results with those of Coronado et al. <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , we noted that their meta-analysis encompassed all between-group differences, with comparators including active, sham, and control interventions.</s>
          <s>The difference is reported as Hedges' g = 0.32, which is a small effect size.</s>
          <s>It is difficult to compare against our results, since we consider their meta-analysis inappropriate given that the comparators are highly heterogeneous.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Changes in PPT are most consistently demonstrated after cervical SMT and fairly consistently after thoracic SMT.</s>
          <s>Both lumbosacral SMT studies showed no change, agreeing with the findings of a review in asymptomatic populations <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is possible that changes over time in PPT do not occur after lumbosacral SMT.</s>
          <s>The changes over time are not isolated to particular musculoskeletal pain populations, appearing to occur regardless of chronicity and spinal or non-spinal pain site.</s>

        <head>Clinical relevance of change in pressure pain threshold</head>
        <p>
          <s>The clinical relevance of PPT is an important consideration.</s>
          <s>It is pertinent to note that statistically significant changes in many short term outcome measures following manual therapy are common and should be interpreted cautiously, since they don't necessarily relate to clinically important outcomes over meaningful time periods <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Articles have stated values for clinically relevant change in PPT of 15% <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> and 1.1 kg/cm 2 <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> , but on inspecting references neither of these are based on the relationship between change in PPT and change in clinically relevant outcome measures.</s>
          <s>The origin of the 15% value <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> cannot be traced to any provided references, and the 1.1 kg/ cm 2 value <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> was calculated via a distribution-based method for estimating clinically importance difference <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref> , using effect sizes and standard error of the mean of PPT.</s>
          <s>There is some evidence, however, that PPT is responsive to change in symptoms, especially to rule in change, based on a study in which change in PPT at the upper trapezius (particularly a change of over 0.86 kg/ cm 2 ) had high specificity and moderate sensitivity for concurrent change in neck pain over 1 week follow-up <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the absence of a clearly defined and valid minimum clinically important difference, it is valuable to consider the minimum detectable change in PPT, which is the minimum change that would be greater than measurement error or chance.</s>
          <s>This has been calculated as between about 0.5 and 3.4 kg/cm 2 (20-50% change) for PPT <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The change over time results in our review (0.32 kg/cm 2 or 10.9%) are clearly less than the proposed minimum detectable change.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we cannot rule out the effect of measurement error and chance on the results.</s>

          <s>However, on inspecting the three temporal summation studies they included (one of which was also included in our review), temporal summation was reduced after SMT in each study, suggesting a mistake on the authors' part.</s>
          <s>Changes in temporal summation after SMT may be worth further study.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Five other types of QST, including thermal pain thresholds, did not change over time or compared to other interventions.</s>

            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> , based on a total of seven unique studies with some overlap between reviews.</s>

          <s>This would account for some, but not all, of the factors proposed by Puhl et al. <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> as important for sham manipulation.</s>
          <s>They suggest that, in order for a sham manipulation to be convincing, consideration should be given to replicating (or concealing) the physical contact between patient and practitioner, the motions induced during the procedure, the thrust, and the sound (cavitation).</s>
          <s>Thus it is questionable whether expectation effects were effectively accounted for in three of the four studies.</s>
          <s>Inadequate control for placebo effects increases the likelihood that results would favour SMT, though we found no significant difference in PPT between SMT and sham in the face of this.</s>
        </p>

Details/explanation 
Scoring key (total max. 13) 

Was PPT measured correctly, and was reliability 
pre-tested? 

Valid/reliable technique includes taking 3 measures 
and averaging all 3 or last 2. 

Both = 1, Valid technique only = 0.5, 
Pre-tested reliability only = 0.5, 
Neither = 0 

Was the assessor blinded? 
-
Yes = 1, No = 0 

Was there appropriate random number 
generation and concealment? 

Random sequence generation, e.g. random number 
generator. Adequate concealment until randomisation 
occurs, e.g. sequential opaque envelopes. 

Method appropriate = 1, Method for 
one component but not both reported 
and appropriate = 0.5, Method NR = 0 

Were active and control interventions 
well described? 

-
Yes = 1, No = 0 

Were practitioners appropriate and sufficiently 
experienced? 

Practitioner with training in spinal manipulative 
therapy, ≥3 years clinical experience. 

Yes = 1, No/NR = 0 

Were attempts made to keep participants naïve 
to study aims? If sham-controlled, were they 
blinded, and confirmed? 

If sham group: Blinded? Confirmed? Naïve to 
study aims? 
If no sham group: Naïve to study aims?
