            <s>The results indicated that: (1) The land use efficiency in China overall was moderately ineffective and the overall utilization level was low; (2) The Global Spatial Autocorrelation was instable and had maintained a high level; (3) The "hot spots" mainly being distributed in the southeast coastal regions and "cold spots" being found in the central and western regions, so that as time goes on, the pattern of "high in the east and low in the west" has been gradually formed and stabilized.</s>
            <s>(4) The GWR model analysis showed that the natural factors such as NDVI, DMSP/OLS and DEM have a significant impact on land use efficiency, thereby providing an important contribution to this study.</s>
            <s>For the eastern coastal areas, the emphasis should be improving their OT, PF and PGDP, for the western region, should focus on improving its comprehensive economic development level to improve the DMSP/OLS, while strengthening the ecological environment to improve the level of NDVI.</s>

            <s>Therefore, implementing a very stringent strategy for economical and intensive land use -in other words, to increase the land use efficiency -is important for resolving the contradiction arising from the land resource supply and demand.</s>

          <s>Among them, the average score in 2013 was 0.623, which was only 50.76% of the optimal level (Shanghai had the highest score of 1.228).</s>
          <s>Nine provinces (30%) reached optimal levels of efficiency, while the remaining 21 provinces (70%) were sub-optimal, meaning that the overall land use efficiency was at a low level.</s>
          <s>In terms of the regional differences, the non-equilibrium of spatial differences was consistent with the level of economic development, which showed the spatial pattern characteristic of being high in the east and low in the middle and west of the country.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Through the analysis, we found that the highest, lowest, and average values for each target year had an overall increasing trend.</s>
          <s>This paper divided the efficiency levels into five categories, highly ineffective, moderately ineffective, slightly ineffective, close to effective, and optimal.</s>
          <s>The results showed that the most common category was moderately ineffective, followed by optimal, highly ineffective, slightly ineffective, and close to effective-with a smaller distribution.</s>
          <s>The range of distributions in each area was large with clear polarization in efficiency.</s>
          <s>At the same time, regions of each type gradually tended to be stable, forming a clear distribution pattern of land use efficiency in China.</s>

          <s>Global Spatial Autocorrelation was Not Stable and Maintained a High Level.</s>
          <s>This study used GeoDa 1.6.7 software to calculate the global spatial autocorrelation index, with results shown in <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results showed that there was significant positive spatial autocorrelation for each year.</s>
          <s>In 2013, for example, the seven provinces that had optimal efficiency were mainly distributed throughout the eastern region, making up 77.78% of that region.</s>
          <s>In the central region, five provinces were moderately ineffective, which accounted for 83.33% of that region.</s>
          <s>In the west, nine provinces were highly or moderately ineffective.</s>
          <s>On the whole, the highest Area of Concentrated Types Mainly Consisted of "Hot Spots" and "Cold Spots" that are Generally Stable.</s>
          <s>GeoDa software was also used to calculate the local spatial autocorrelation index.</s>
          <s>Here was an example: the corresponding provinces within each quadrant for 2013 were labeled in a scatter plot, as shown in Figs 1 and 2. In <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> , taking the standardized value of land use efficiency in each region as the abscissa and the weighted average (also called Spatial lag) of all neighboring provinces as the vertical axis draw scatter diagram, the provinces corresponding to each quadrant of the scatter plot were plotted.</s>
          <s>The first and third quadrants were spatially positively correlated and the second and fourth quadrants were spatially negatively correlated.</s>
          <s>Through an assessment of <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> , we found that most provinces were located in the first and third quadrant.</s>
          <s>There was a larger number of low value area clusters that were more widely distributed, which was the main driver of the positive spatial autocorrelation.</s>
          <s>Most of the "low-low" provinces in the third quadrant were located in the midwest, while all the "high-high" provinces in the first quadrant were located in the east-including Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian.</s>
          <s>The "S" shape area, which was made up of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Guangdong, formed the main distribution region of the second and fourth quadrant.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distribution of different provinces in 2013, and it shows that the overall performance of land use efficiency is mainly made up of the aggregations of "low-low" provinces, with few "high-high" provinces and fewer "low-high" and "high-low" aggregations.</s>

          <s>The "high-high" were all located in the eastern provinces, the "low-low" were in the central and western provinces, only one province, Jiangxi, was found in the "low-high", and only Yunnan Province was found in the "high-low" in 2010.</s>
          <s>Overall, the LISA aggregation area was relatively stable, and the "high-high" aggregation region presented an increasing trend.</s>
          <s>Among them, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang were adjacent to one another, which formed a "Hot spot" for high efficiency.</s>

          <s>The sequence as follows: PGDP &gt; NDVI &gt; OT &gt; PF &gt; DMSP/OLS &gt; PS &gt; DEM, and only PS was negative, which demonstrated that an average increase in DEM, NDVI, OT, PF, DMSP/OLS, and PGDP led to an increase in land use efficiency, while the increase in PS led to a decrease.</s>
          <s>The further analysis of the maximum, Q1, median, Q3 and the minimum found that the coefficients for PGDP, PF, OT, DMSP/OLS, and NDVI were positive, which meant these variables also had positive effects on land use efficiency in each province.</s>
          <s>There were positive and negative values of DEM, which indicated it had positive and negative effects.</s>
          <s>PS were negative for all provinces, which produced a negative effect on land use efficiency in every province.</s>
          <s>In order to analyze the influence of each variable on land use efficiency in each province, the coefficient distribution map for the influencing factors was created <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> .</s>
          <s>PGDP was an important indicator of the level of economic development, and its regression coefficient exhibited a characteristic of being "high in the northeast, low in the southwest.</s>
          <s>" The average PGDP value was the largest of the explanatory variables, indicating that improving the level of economic development was the most significant driver for improvement in land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>Based on the coefficient, the influence varied across the different provinces; among them, Heilongjiang was the most sensitive to this.</s>
          <s>When the PGDP changed by 1% the land use efficiency responded with a 0.25% change.</s>
          <s>The minimum influence was found in Yunnan Province, where a 1% change in PGDP led to a land use efficiency change only by 0.16%.</s>
          <s>On the one hand, with the continuous development of the regional economy, the mode of economic growth has been continuously transformed.</s>
          <s>The endogenous economic development and the high resource efficiency have improved the overall land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, however, with the continuous economic improvement, the contradiction arising from the supply and demand of land resource has been intensified.</s>
          <s>The economic and intensive use of the land resource, along with the improvement of the land stock utility potential, has become a key way to solve the contradiction arising from land supply and demand in the new era.</s>
          <s>With the continuous advancement and implementation of this strategy, the level of land use efficiency will be improved.</s>
          <s>The contradiction arising from the land supply and demand in eastern and northeastern part is greater than in the central and western part, so there is greater potential to improve the efficiency of land use by the economic and intensive land use.</s>
          <s>PF was the main indicator of the regional investment level, which had a positive coefficient and basically the same distribution trend as PGDP.</s>
          <s>The main reason for this was that PF had a direct relationship with the land resource utilization pattern driven by the economic development and the stage of the economic development.</s>

          <s>PS was an important indicator of the level of regional industrial structure, and its coefficient was negative.</s>
          <s>PS was the only variable that had the effect of reducing land use efficiency in each province, where the coefficient increased from north to south but with weak effects overall.</s>
          <s>In Heilongjiang province, the absolute value of the PS coefficient was the highest, meaning it had the strongest negative effect.</s>
          <s>The lowest value and the weakest effect were found in Hainan province.</s>
          <s>The main reasons for this were as follows: Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and other provinces making up of the old industrial base in the northeast have relied on rapid industrialization to promote the economic development since the Reform and Opening-up.</s>
          <s>Under long-term extensive development, these provinces experienced problems such as low industry concentration and incoherent industrial distribution, meaning that the intensive utilization of land resources was low-which led to the strongest negative effect on land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The regular improvement of transformation and upgrading measures to promote advanced development of the industry in the eastern coastal areas, including Beijing, Tianjin, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, led to the reduction of this suppression.</s>
          <s>With the continuous optimization and upgrading of industrial structure in China, the coefficient may continue to change until it plays a positive role.</s>

          <s>The coefficient showed a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northwest inland areas, but the coefficient was only 0.029 and the difference was not significant.</s>
          <s>On the one hand, the degree of opening improves land use efficiency through the promotion of economic development; on the other hand, it will further promote the continuous transformation of economic development from extensive to intensive, which will in turn improve the land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>Due to the different economic development levels and land use patterns, the coefficient had a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest.</s>
          <s>DMSP/OLS, DEM and NDVI are the main feature indicators of regional natural conditions.</s>
          <s>The coefficients for DMSP/OLS and NDVI were positive, and they were positive and negative for DEM.</s>
          <s>The average value of the NDVI coefficient was only exceeded by PGDP, meaning it was a significant predictor of higher land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The coefficient for DMSP/OLS was small, implying that it had a weak positive effect on land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The DEM coefficients led to lower land use efficiency in the contiguous region from Heilongjiang to Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, but in other areas DEM played a role in promoting the land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The spatial distribution trends of the coefficients for DMSP/OLS, DEM, and NDVI were essentially the same, decreasing from the southwest to the northeast.</s>
          <s>The reasons were as follows: although DMSP/OLS was a representation of regional social attributes, its continuous distribution characteristics made it's a complex of social and natural factors.</s>
          <s>DMSP/OLS, DEM and NDVI had the same distribution trend, which was closely related to the distribution of natural geographical features in China.</s>
          <s>Due to the fragile natural conditions in the west and southwest, with the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the improvement of natural resources plays a great role in the promotion of land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The ecosystem stability in the eastern region is stronger and the effect of land use is weaker in there.</s>

          <s>Implications for improving land use efficiency.</s>
          <s>The natural and socio-economic factors such as PGDP, PF, OT, DMSP/OLS and NDVI had a positive effect, therefore, we need to improve the PGDP, PF, OT and other social and economic indicators, and protecting the ecological environment and increasing the vegetation coverage to improve the NDVI level are also needed.</s>
          <s>Meanwhile, we should put efforts to improve the overall level of social development, thus to improve the regional DMSP/OLS.</s>
          <s>The PS had a negative effect on land use efficiency, therefore, all provinces need to upgrade the industry, reduce the proportion of the second industry, and strive to increase the proportion of the tertiary industry.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The research results of the land use efficiency showed the hot spots are mainly distributed in the southeast coastal areas, and the cold spots are mainly found in the central and western regions, with that the influence factors also show obvious geographical distribution difference.</s>
          <s>For the eastern coastal areas, the emphasis should be improving their OT, PF and PGDP.</s>
          <s>For the western region of less economically developed, it should focus on improving its comprehensive economic development level to improve the DMSP/OLS, while strengthening the ecological environment to improve the level of NDVI.</s>
          <s>At the same time, should actively promote energy conservation and emission reduction and increase the overall land use efficiency level.</s>
