            <s>These materials are constrained by their physical properties, such as frequency selectivity, environmental sensitivity, time behavior, and fixed nonlinear response.</s>
            <s>Here, we show that electro-optic spatial light modulators (SLMs) can take the place of traditional nonlinear media, provided that there is a feedback between the shape of the object and the pattern on the modulator.</s>

          <s>In our geometry, the feedback between source and detector closes the loop in computational imaging.</s>

          <s>Nonlinear phase reconstruction.</s>
          <s>While the method can be applied to any type of image (provided there is a signal to bootstrap), phase reconstruction is particularly important.</s>
          <s>Phase contains most of the information in the signal, is crucial for a variety of important applications, and responds particularly well to nonlinearity <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, we experimentally demonstrate the method by nonlinearly improving the imaging of a phase object <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We use a modified version of the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) method <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> to retrieve the phase, taking advantage of the fact that phase matching from the nonlinear illumination-object feedback provides a strict constraint on the behavior of the algorithm <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">20</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the shape of the object is not known a priori, we first record a defocused intensity (I U = |A U | 2 ) that is obtained using uniform illumination <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The amplitude distribution, |A U |, is then fed into a SLM as a phase modulation φ SLM ∝|A U |, enabling a second intensity measurement (I D = |A D | 2 ) with designer illumination <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1e)</ref> .</s>
          <s>As in previous examples of nonlinear imaging <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> , we use a self-defocusing nonlinearity; this enables sufficient wave mixing to enhance imaging while suppressing the fast instabilities common to self-focusing systems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>From the two images I U and I D , the nonlinear phase retrieval algorithm proceeds in a manner similar to GS reconstruction.</s>
          <s>First, a field with amplitude A U and initial uniform phase φ = 0 is numerically back-propagated from the (out-of-focus) camera plane to the sample plane (in focus).</s>
          <s>The phase modulation φ SLM is then added to the phase of the field in order to simulate the action of the SLM, and the new field is forward-propagated to the camera plane.</s>
          <s>This simulated amplitude is then replaced by the amplitude of the actual measurement (A D ), and the field is backward-propagated to the sample plane again.</s>
          <s>After subtraction of the phase modulation φ SLM from the phase of the field at the sample plane, the new field is once again forward-propagated to the camera plane, followed by replacement of the numerical amplitude by the measured amplitude A U. The process is repeated until convergence.</s>
          <s>A pseudocode for this algorithm is shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>As a phase object, we used a sample consisting of a glass plate with the three characters "DIC" etched on it.</s>
          <s>The in-focus image of the sample is shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the object is thin and transparent, no intensity modulation appear on the image in focus apart from scattering from the character edges.</s>
          <s>In <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> ,e, we show the measured diffraction intensity distributions in the detector plane (out-of-focus) with uniform and designer (feedback) illumination, respectively.</s>
          <s>In general, more diffraction fringes are visible in the latter image, since the illumination has the shape of the object itself.</s>
          <s>The second pass of illumination effectively doubles the diffraction pattern, giving at least a two-fold increase in phase sensitivity to the object.</s>
          <s>Larger multiplication is of course possible <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> , especially with cascaded interactions <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> , with potentially exponential improvement upon repeated iteration.</s>
          <s>We compare our nonlinear algorithm with a variation of the GS algorithm for linear propagation, for the same defocused distance.</s>
          <s>The conventional algorithm relies on one in-focus and one out-of-focus intensity measurement using uniform illumination.</s>
          <s>Simulation results are shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2a,b</ref> .</s>
          <s>In real imaging cases, the target is unknown and the reconstructed phase error cannot be accessed; in the simulation test case, the ground truth is chosen a priori, and we can quantitatively measure the reconstructed phase error</s>

          <s>As expected, the nonlinear reconstruction <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref> is about 2x better than the linear reconstruction <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2a</ref> ) in term of the phase error (ER 0.8 vs. 1.5).</s>
          <s>The experimental counterparts, shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 2c,d</ref> , confirm the result that the nonlinear algorithm provides much better reconstruction than the linear algorithm.</s>
          <s>For quantitative comparison, we define contrast and resolution as:</s>

        <formula xml:id="formula_1">= − Contrast I I (2) DIC B KG = ∇ ∈ − R I ( ) (3) x x DICE 1</formula>
        <p>
          <s>where I represents the mean value of the intensity, the subscript "DIC" denotes the region of the DIC characters, "BKG" denotes the rest of the image, and "DICE" denotes the edge domain of the DIC region.</s>
          <s>(For a consistent measure of resolution based on a single image, we take the highest resolvable spatial frequency, given by the inverse of the normalized image gradient averaged over all the character edges.)</s>
          <s>By these metrics, the nonlinear algorithm yields a 260% improvement in contrast (1.50 vs. 0.58) and a 15% improvement in resolution (14.8 vs 17.1 microns) over linear reconstruction.</s>
          <s>Another advantage of the digital system, and the corresponding algorithm, is the ability to work for different degrees of spatial coherence.</s>
          <s>We demonstrate this experimentally by making the illumination beam partially spatially coherent by passing it through a rotating diffuser <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23</ref> .</s>
          <s>The performance of linear and nonlinear modulation, in terms of contrast and resolution, are shown in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3j</ref> ,k, respectively.</s>
          <s>In all cases, the figures of merit for linear propagation get worse monotonically as the degree of coherence is decreased (consistent with a progressive decrease in visibility of diffraction fringes <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In the nonlinear case, both contrast and resolution are improved simultaneously beyond their linear limits.</s>
          <s>[This win-win situation, normally an engineering trade-off in linear systems <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> , is a general feature of nonlinear imaging systems <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .]</s>
          <s>For designer illumination, the contrast actually improves with decreasing coherence, up to an optimal value, while the system resolution is relatively constant above and below this value.</s>
          <s>The former is a stochastic resonance effect <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> , peaking when the smallest significant feature of the object (the stroke width of the DIC characters, ~167 μm) matches the spatial correlation length of the illumination (characterized by the speckle spatial frequency 3.75 × 10 4 rad/m).</s>
          <s>The latter results from improved visibility due to mean-field (DC) scattering <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21</ref> .</s>

          <s>These optimum transfer functions can be understood by considering the extremes of nonlinear response.</s>
          <s>For very weak response, there is little difference between linear and nonlinear output, and therefore little gain in information.</s>

          <s>From an information perspective, the structured feedback acts as a nonlinear matched filter <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32</ref> , with an amplitude-dependent response appropriate for the optical transfer function of coherent light and an intensity-dependent response appropriate for the modulation transfer function of incoherent light <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">33</ref> .</s>

          <s>Here, the object-dependent pattern on the spatial light modulator creates a similar grating (computer-generated hologram) in the plane of the SLM, which acts more like an iterative map.</s>
          <s>In both cases, the nonlinear feedback means that the grating structure is automatically phase-matched with the object, guaranteeing an optimized diffraction pattern.</s>
          <s>For the computational part, the interplay between intensity and phase gives an extra constraint on the algorithm, resulting in improved phase sensitivity, selectivity, and convergence.</s>
          <s>While electro-optic devices have their limitations, they are far more versatile than the physical media traditionally used for nonlinear optics.</s>
          <s>Of particular significance is the ability to create nonlinearities that are distinct from those of physical media by leveraging independent control of amplitude and phase modulation.</s>
          <s>This freedom opens new applications for functional forms that have remained purely in the mathematical domain.</s>
          <s>The ability to adjust parameters dynamically also holds much promise for improving the efficiency and performance of adaptive optics and compressed sensing/imaging.</s>
          <s>Finally, digital methods have the potential to revolutionize imaging at extremely low light levels, such as fluorescence microscopy and quantum imaging, as SLMs are inherently non-destructive and can operate at the single photon level.</s>
