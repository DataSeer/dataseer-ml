          <s>But we have found slightly different results regarding the cognition -related areas presented in these previous studies.</s>

          <s>First, most previous studies have used different EF tests other than WCST, so this factor may have contributed partially to the differences observed in our study.</s>
          <s>The WCST used in this study is commonly recognized as a representative test reflecting EF and is used widely, but detailed differentiation is limited in some cases <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">54</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previous studies have reported that damage to regional brain areas not considered to be directly involved in EF caused impairment of WCST performance <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">55</ref> .</s>
          <s>In other words, this suggests that various regions of the brain are likely to be involved in WCST performance due to the complexity of the WCST performance itself.</s>
          <s>As a good example in explaining it, activations of primary motor lateral premotor and supplementary motor area responding to visuo-spatial cues and causing motor response and cerebellum were remarkable in a positron emission tomography (PET) study performed with WCST <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">56,</ref>
            <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">57</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, Nagahama et al. performed abbreviated WCST to exclude the effect of maintenance of sets, and it showed that attention to color was correlated with the activation of the ventro-occipital and left superior occipital cortex, while attention to shape was correlated with the inferior occipital cortex respectively <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">56</ref> .</s>
          <s>The GMV of the anterior cerebellum was highly correlated with the WCST subcategories in this study.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated prominent activation of the anterior cerebellum during WCST performance, although the anterior cerebellum is not considered to be highly involved in EF <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">55,</ref>

          <s>Second, these previous studies have been done mostly in adults, while our study was done in adolescents.</s>
          <s>Although this study is cross-sectional, the fact that the different ages of the participants produce different results can be inferred indirectly by comparing the differences in development patterns of the cerebellum between boys and girls.</s>
          <s>As we mentioned earlier, the cerebellar volume changes according to age in an inverted U-shape <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">59,</ref>
            <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">60</ref> , and the cerebellum is also a part of the brain which has big differences in development depending on gender <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">59</ref> .</s>
          <s>The average age of the boys participating in this study was about 15 years and it has been known that the cerebellar volume in this age reaches the peak.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the average age of the girls participating in this study was about 14 years, and the cerebellum volume starts to decrease after 2 years of the peak period.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In addition, for girls, the relationship between the anterior and inferior lobe tends to get weaker with advancing age, but for boys, this relationship doesn't change <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among the cerebellar regions, the inferior posterior lobe is most closely related to the frontal gray matter, which is the core area of EF, and develops in a pattern similar to that of the frontal gray matter 46 .</s>
          <s>Regional differences for EF in the cerebellum might be affected by the frontal gray matter, and this may explain the reason for a different cerebellar change between girls and boys with advancing age.</s>
          <s>The age of 14-15 years is still the period for active growth of frontal gray matter, and the development potential for EF is very strong.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Furthermore, most studies on both cerebellum and cognitive function have been previously performed in adolescents with either brain disorders involving the cerebellum or cerebellar injury <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">61</ref> .</s>
          <s>On the other hand, some longitudinal studies on the cerebellar volume have been performed in typically developing adolescents <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">59,</ref>
            <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">60</ref> .</s>
          <s>This means that there exists some neuroimaging evidence for typically developing cerebellum in adolescents.</s>
          <s>However, none of those studies used tools that measure EF directly.</s>
          <s>So we can only posit that certain areas of the cerebellum play a specific role in EF by integrating the results from studies on cerebellar volume of typically developing adolescents and the results from studies on EF in adolescents with cerebellar dysfunction.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the results on the role of specific areas in the cerebellum of adolescents are not definitive.</s>

          <s>The characteristic feature of this study is that FMS showed significant negative correlation with GMV of vermis 1-4 in boys.</s>
          <s>Additionally, GMV of vermis 5-9, although not significant, showed negative correlation, implying that selectively it is more closely related to the vermis than the other subcategories.</s>
          <s>It is also suggested that childhood depression is associated with FMS 68 .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>After correcting for CDI, only a slight, but not significant increase was observed in correlation between FMS and GMV of vermis.</s>
          <s>This study was done with a cross sectional design, so it is not possible to determine the causal relationship of depression with EF and the cerebellar GMV.</s>
          <s>However, depression does not seem to have affected the correlation between FMS and GMV of the vermis.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, in girls, the FMS showed significant correlation with vermis 4-5, 6 and Crus I, II, showing a different pattern according to region from that in boys.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>ISI showed negative correlation with the GMV of right lobule 10 (flocculonodular lobe) only in boys, and among WCST subcategies, CLR, LL, and CC showed negative correlation.</s>
          <s>However, the GMV of the flocculonodular lobe did not show correlation with these 3 categories, so we suggest that the correlation between ISI and the right flocculonodular lobe is independent from EF.</s>
          <s>In girls, ISI showed no significant correlation with any cerebellar GMV or WCST subcategories.</s>
          <s>Previous studies have also shown that the cognitive functions of boys are more affected by sleep than girls <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">43</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previously, Joo et al. <ref target="#b70" type="bibr">69</ref> have reported in a VBM study of chronic primary insomnia patients that although cerebellar gray matter deficits are observed, the relationship between sleep and clinical variables associated with cognitive disorders are not clear.</s>
          <s>The flocculonodular lobe is only known to be involved in vestibular function and influences spatial learning <ref target="#b71" type="bibr">70</ref> , and so far its relationship with sleep is not known.</s>
          <s>The regional function of the cerebellum is still mainly unknown.</s>
          <s>The correlation between GMV of the right flocculonodular lobe and insomnia that is only observed in boys in the present study requires further verification.</s>
          <s>The correlation between cerebellar regional GMV and EF showed a large gender difference.</s>
          <s>Cerebellar regions that showed significant correlation with GMV and WCST subcategories were more numerous in boys (52, 37 when FDR &lt; 0.2, versus 28, 0 when FDR &lt; 0.2 in girls).</s>
          <s>Additionally, in boys, the areas of correlation were mainly centered on lobule 3, vermis 1-2, 3, 10, while in girls there was no particular region, and correlation strength was also relatively weak.</s>
          <s>There is no existing study that explains the reason for this sexual dimorphism.</s>
          <s>A plausible explanation may be the aforementioned differences in cerebellar development according to gender.</s>
          <s>Considering the fact that girls show earlier brain development <ref target="#b72" type="bibr">71</ref> , the pruning period of adolescence may also be chronologically different, thus resulting in functional and formative differences dependent on gender.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Another possible explanation is the influence of sex hormones.</s>
          <s>There are many estrogen receptors in the cerebellum, especially in Purkinje neurons <ref target="#b73" type="bibr">72,</ref>
            <ref target="#b74" type="bibr">73</ref> , and the neuroprotective or neurotrophic effect of estrogen may affect EF and cerebellar volume.</s>
          <s>In studies with postmenopausal women, women receiving estrogen showed larger GMV in the cerebellum and cognitive function was better than the control group <ref target="#b75" type="bibr">[74]</ref>
            <ref target="#b76" type="bibr">[75]</ref>
            <ref target="#b77" type="bibr">[76]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another study with 12 to 27-year old participants found that in male subjects, higher endogenous testosterone corresponded with larger cerebellar GMV.</s>
          <s>Considering the results of previous studies, it is plausible that sex hormones may have contributed to the gender differences observed in the present study <ref target="#b78" type="bibr">77</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>However, as everything mentioned above at present is only presumed, further neurobiological studies are required in the future, in order to identify the root causes of the gender difference influence on the correlation between the cerebellar regional GMV and EF.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Limitations in this study include the small number of subjects, the fact that the total brain volume or white matter has not been taken into account, and the problem with WCST itself as a valid EF measurement tool.</s>
          <s>Also, because this study is a cross-sectional study, it cannot explain the causal relationship between cerebellar GMV and EF, and it is also limited in that we cannot be sure that every functional change accompanies a corresponding morphologic change (or vice versa).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In a nutshell, larger cerebellar GMV corresponded to better EF in adolescents.</s>
          <s>Insomnia did not influence these correlations, but more severe insomnia in boys correlated with smaller GMV in the right flocculonodular lobe.</s>
          <s>We suggest that the adolescent cerebellum is involved differently in EF according to gender.</s>
