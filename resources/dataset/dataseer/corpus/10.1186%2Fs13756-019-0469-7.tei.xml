            <s>Background: The presence of macrolide-resistant Myocplasma pneumoniae has been frequently reported in recent years, especially in China.</s>
            <s>In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility and genotype against M. pneumoniae isolates from 2014 to 2016, Beijing.</s>

          <p>
            <s>We investigated the activities of four antibiotics against 81 M. pneumoniae isolates in vitro.</s>
            <s>All isolates were amplification of domains II and V of the 23S rRNA gene and the L4 and L22 ribosomal protein fragments.</s>
            <s>All isolates were genotyped with duplex real-time PCR, MLVA and VNTR detection in p1 gene.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Results: The macrolide resistance rate was 65.4% (53/81).</s>
            <s>Each of the macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates was resistant to erythromycin (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC, ≥256 μg/ml) and azithromycin (MIC, 2-64 μg/ml), but susceptible to tetracycline and levofloxacin in vitro.</s>
            <s>Fifty two macrolide-resistant isolates harbored the A2063G mutation, and only 1 macrolide-resistant isolates harbored the A2064G mutation in domain V of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene.</s>
            <s>The C162A, A430G, and T279C mutations in the L4 and L22 ribosomal protein genes were not responsible for macrolide resistance, but they were related to the particular genotype of M. pneumoniae.</s>
            <s>95.7% of type 1 isolates (45/47) were macrolide-resistance, and 23.5% of the type 2 isolates (8/34) were macrolide-resistance. Type 2 M. pneumoniae macrolide-resistance rate was 50.6% higher than that of the previous reports in China.</s>
            <s>The eight macrolide-resistant type 2 M. pneumoniae isolates were belong to 3/5/6/2 and 3/5/7/2 MLVA genotypes.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Conclusion: To our knowledge, this phenomenon likely resulted from a combination of genotype shifting from type1 to type 2 and antibiotic selection pressure in M. pneumoniae in China in recent years.</s>
            <s>The increase of resistance in type 2 is not due to the spread of same clone.</s>
            <s>However, the relationship between genotype shifts and macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae needs to be further verified with more extensive surveillance data.</s>

        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that causes human respiratory tract infections, especially in community-acquired pneumonia, which accounts for 10-40% of cases <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although most of the infections are mild or self-limited, severe clinical symptoms are increasingly occurring.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, M. pneumoniae infections may lead to more severe extra-pulmonary conditions, such as erythema multiforme, myocarditis, and meningitis neuritis <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[4]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is well known that M. pneumoniae is one of the smallest self-replicating organisms and lacks a cell wall, which makes it non-susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics.</s>
          <s>Therefore, macrolides are the primary drugs of choice for the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections in clinical settings <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics provides selective pressure for the development of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae.</s>
          <s>Since 2000, the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains has become a growing global problem.</s>
          <s>Macrolide resistance rates were reported to be approximately 3% in Germany <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , 10% in France <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[9]</ref> , 2% in Switzerland <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , 26% in Italy <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[11]</ref> , 3% in Denmark <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , and 11% in the United States <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Finally in Spain, the presence of a macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolate causing community-acquired pneumonia was first reported in 2014 <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although Europe and the United States have lower rates of macrolide resistance, Asiatic countries have the highest rates.</s>
          <s>After the first macrolide-resistant strain of M. pneumoniae was isolated in 2001 <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[15]</ref> , Japan reported a dramatic increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, and the macrolide resistance rate exceeded 90% in 2011 <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[16]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[17]</ref>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In South Korea, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae increased from 0 to 63% within 10 years <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[20,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In China, the infection rate of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has always been high, ranging from 69 to 100% <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>
