            <s>Recently, as the paradigm of medical services has shifted from treatment to prevention, there is a growing interest in smart healthcare that can provide users with healthcare services anywhere, at any time, using information and communications technologies.</s>
            <s>With the development of the smart healthcare industry, there is a growing need for collecting largescale personal health data to exploit the knowledge obtained through analyzing them for improving the smart healthcare services.</s>
            <s>Although such a considerable amount of health data can be a valuable asset to the smart healthcare fields, they may cause serious privacy problems if sensitive information of an individual user is leaked to outside users.</s>
            <s>Therefore, most individuals are reluctant to provide their health data to smart healthcare service providers for data analysis and utilization purpose, which is the biggest challenge in smart healthcare fields.</s>
            <s>Thus, in this paper, we develop a novel mechanism for privacy-preserving collection of personal health data streams that is characterized as temporal data collected at fixed intervals by leveraging local differential privacy (LDP).</s>
            <s>In particular, with the proposed approach, a data contributor uses a given privacy budget of LDP to report a small amount of salient data, which are extracted from an entire health data stream, to a data collector.</s>
            <s>Then, a data collector can effectively reconstruct a health data stream based on the noisy salient data received from a data contributor.</s>

          <s>In recent years, with the development of information and communications technologies, smart healthcare services, focused on disease prevention and health promotion by continuously monitoring users' health and providing real-time customized service, are receiving significant attention.</s>
          <s>The basic structure of smart healthcare is that service providers collect data generated by individual users in their daily lives and by medical institutions about patients and then provide customized advice and treatment to users based on the knowledge obtained through analyzing a large amount of collected data.</s>
          <s>With a rapidly aging society, increased medical burden due to chronic illnesses and increased interest in health due to abnormal PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207639</s>

        <p>
          <s>climate conditions around the world, the demand for smart healthcare service is expected to continue to increase in the future.</s>
          <s>Along with the development of the internet of things (IoT) technology, wearable devices based on IoT are being actively developed and used.</s>
          <s>In particular, the technology development of wearable devices that can continuously monitor human activity and bio-signals using sensors has played a major role in the development of the smart healthcare industry.</s>
          <s>For example, with the wide spread use of wearable devices having various bio sensors, it is possible to easily measure and monitor diverse health data such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and body temperature of individuals.</s>
          <s>This, in turn, makes it possible to provide an alarm service, notifying in advance the risk of disease outbreak to users by collecting and analyzing vast amount of health data based on individual activities of daily living.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The development of the smart healthcare industry brings forth a need for collecting largescale personal health data in order to leverage the knowledge obtained through analyzing such data for improving smart healthcare services.</s>
          <s>For example, Apple Health <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , Google Fit <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[2]</ref> , and Samsung S-Health <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[3]</ref> aggregate vast amounts of health-related data using smartphones and wearable devices such as a smartwatch and smartband.</s>
          <s>A telecare medicine information system, which is widely used to provide remote medical care to a patient <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , continuously monitors and collects the patient's health data through various physiological signal monitoring systems.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Serious concerns of data privacy have been raised in many areas over the past few years.</s>
          <s>One of the most representative areas is that of privacy in a cloud environment.</s>
          <s>In this environment, user data are typically stored on cloud servers, which are often outside of a trusted domain <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Even though a large collection of health data is a valuable asset to the smart healthcare field, similar data privacy concerns are raised.</s>
          <s>That is, indiscriminate collection of personal health data can cause significant privacy issues; sensitive information of individual users can be deduced by tracking and analyzing health data.</s>
          <s>Hence, most users do not agree to their health data being collected for the purposes of data analysis and utilization.</s>
          <s>This presents a major obstacle for the development of smart healthcare services.</s>
          <s>
            <ref type="figure">Fig 1</ref> illustrates the motivational scenario of this research where a smart healthcare service provider wants to collect and analyze a large volume of health data to obtain heart rate changes of individuals with desk jobs with the aim of enhancing the quality of healthcare service customized for them.</s>
          <s>However, considering that individual are reluctant to provide their sensitive health data, to support such a service provider's requirement, it is essential to develop methods capable of collecting individuals' health data, while preserving their privacy.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The goal in this paper is to develop a novel mechanism for privacy-preserving collection of individual health data streams generated from smart healthcare sensors by leveraging local differential privacy (LDP).</s>
          <s>LDP is a state-of-the-art approach that is used to protect individual privacy during the process of data collection <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The basic idea of the LDP is that a data contributor adds carefully designed random noises to the original data and sends the noisy data to a data collector, guaranteeing that the data contributor's original data is not leaked during the data collection process.</s>
          <s>With the growing popularity of LDP, there have been extensive studies to leverage LDP for collecting individuals' sensitive data, generated in diverse application domains, in a privacy-preserving manner <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[7]</ref>

          <s>However, these existing approaches focus on the collection of individual data represented as bit-strings where each bit corresponds to either 0 or 1, and thus they are not applicable for collecting individual health data that is usually represented as a stream (or time series).</s>
