            <s>African populations are characterized by high degree of genetic diversity.</s>
            <s>This high genetic diversity could result from the natural selection pressure.</s>
            <s>Several studies have described an association between some genetic diversities and difference of susceptibility to infectious diseases like malaria.</s>
            <s>It seems therefore important to consider genetic diversity impact when interpreting results of clinical trials in malaria endemic areas.</s>
            <s>This study aimed to determine the genetic polymorphism with erythrocyte traits in different populations of malaria endemic area in Mali.</s>
            <s>The cross-sectional surveys were carried out in different ethnic groups living in malaria endemic areas in Mali.</s>
            <s>Six milliliters of whole blood were collected in EDTA vials from each participant after informed consent has been obtained.</s>

          <s>The ABO and the other blood group systems remain of prime importance in transfusion medicine.</s>
          <s>These blood group antigens are mainly expressed on erythrocytes.</s>
          <s>They are the most immunogenic and the most common cause of life threatening from a blood transfusion in which an incompatible type of ABO blood is transfused.</s>
          <s>They are polymorphic and are associated to susceptibility/protection against certain infectious disease such as malaria.</s>

          <s>African genetic diversity is associated with significant demographic and cultural diversity, making the continent a relevant place to study factors contributing to the definition of gene pool of contemporary populations.</s>

          <s>The Sahel-Saharan regions have a strong cultural diversity, with contrasting climatic areas in terms of rainfall, defining different environments and lifestyles.</s>
          <s>The populations living in these environments are constantly affected by numerous infectious diseases, leading to a strong pressure of natural selection <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

          <s>The natural resistance to disease could be the sum of polymorphisms of several genetic markers.</s>
          <s>Since some polymorphisms in erythrocyte systems have been described to be associated with susceptibility or resistance to diseases, their distribution and their impact should be considered in epidemiological studies of malaria.</s>
