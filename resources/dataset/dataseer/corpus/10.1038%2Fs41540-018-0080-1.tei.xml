          <s>With rising interest in plant biomass for nutritional, pharmaceutical, and energetic use, understanding of parameters that determine growth will become more and more important.</s>
          <s>However, modeling of plant growth is hampered by the dependence of resource allocation to either shoot or root on environmental parameters and the inability to record the root/ shoot ratio non-invasively during the growth phase.</s>
          <s>To circumvent this problem, indirect parameters have been deployed to estimate the fraction of assimilates that are allocated to leaf growth and root formation, respectively.</s>
          <s>Models based on the transportresistance model by <ref type="bibr">Thornley</ref>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">1</ref> focus on either shoot functions like starch metabolism 2 and leaf area 3 or root functions like water and nutrient uptake 4 or sink strength.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> All these models handle biomass gain on a day-to-day basis, even though diurnal fluctuation of light intensity can be incorporated.</s>
          <s>Models based on "optimal partitioning" 6 or on the "balanced growth hypothesis" 7 are powerful at quantitatively describing the impact of environmental perturbations, but are insufficient at quantifying allocation for high-resolution in time.</s>
          <s>Poorter et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8</ref> demonstrated that even ontogenetic shifts in the root/shoot ratio could not be represented by these models.</s>
          <s>In contrast, modeling of metabolic dynamics is possible at hourly or even smaller time steps, thus restraining the simulation of the metabolic base of growth.</s>
          <s>Investigations of hourly resolved growth patterns of leaves in most cases rely on video capturing studies and have yielded diverging results.</s>
          <s>In the CAM intermediate Clusia minor, leaf growth peaked in the night when in C3 mode of photosynthesis, while it was higher during the day in CAM mode.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> In field grown wheat, growth was larger during the day, <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> while for maize grown in climate chambers the pattern was less clear.</s>
          <s>

          <s>This reflects an important aspect of the imaging experiments: they document leaf expansion rather than structural carbon gain, and are thus strongly depending on the leaf water status.</s>
          <s>Growth is a complex phenomenon, integrating various metabolic pathways.</s>
          <s>Not only is the uptake of CO 2 crucial for plant biomass production, but also sugar biosynthesis, carbon allocation to sink tissue, and respiration.</s>
          <s>Elucidation of the interactions of these pathways is crucial to understanding of the functions of the central metabolism for leaf biomass formation.</s>
          <s>Here, we present a stepwise development of a metabolic model that is capable of integrating different pathways (sugar metabolism, carbonic acid metabolism, amino acid synthesis) for simulating leaf structural carbon formation.</s>
          <s>The resulting dynamic model of the central metabolism of A. thaliana leaves can simulate shoot structural carbon formation at high resolution in time.</s>
          <s>This was achieved by allocating carbon, gained through photosynthesis, to either metabolic pools, root supply, or leaf structural carbon.</s>
          <s>The latter pool contains all carbon allocated to compounds with long residence time like cell wall or proteins.</s>
          <s>In this approach, allocation of carbon was independent of imaging data, as shoot structural carbon gain was calculated solely based on photosynthesis and metabolite data.</s>

          <s>The metabolic model focused on the plant aerial organs as a sole source for carbon fixation.</s>
          <s>All carbon that was not contained in one of the metabolite pools was considered to either contribute to structural carbon formation in the source tissue or be exported to sink organs, which, in the chosen experimental setup, are represented solely by the root system.</s>
          <s>Exported assimilates are either used for root respiration or used root structural carbon formation.</s>
          <s>This was not further resolved, because root material was not accessible in soil grown plants.</s>
          <s>Model development started from a simple model as introduced by Nägele et al. <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> This model comprised NPS as input, four carbohydrates, hexose phosphates as central hub, one combined pool of carboxylic and amino acids (CaAa), and three possible outputs: (i) shoot structural carbon gain, (ii) export of sucrose to sink organs and (iii) respiratory release of CO 2 from CaAa during the night <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The final model shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref> was built up in seven steps, each increasing the complexity by adding regulatory and/or metabolic details, which are listed in <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> .</s>
          <s>The final model contained several branch points, two cycles and various regulatory terms affecting enzyme activities.</s>
          <s>The two cycles are: (i) the sucrose cycle, in which HP are used as substrate by SPS to produce sucrose, which is then degraded by Inv to glucose and fructose, each of which can be re-phosphorylated to HP by hexokinase (Hxk), and (ii) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).</s>
          <s>The last step of sucrose cycling is restricted in the gin2-1 mutant as gin2-1 does not possess the HXK1 enzyme.</s>
          <s>This resulted in fiveto seven-fold reduction in sucrose cycling in the mutant as calculated from the flux through r6 <ref type="figure">(Fig. S8</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Sole input for the final model is still CO 2 fixation, but the output of the system has become more complex, as amino acids are now able to leave the system through either structural carbon formation in the source tissue or export, and respiration of CO 2 is now only possible from the Mal/Fum pool.</s>
          <s>The Cit pool is linked to the Aa and Mal/Fum pool through interconversion terms and does therefore contribute indirectly to the output of the system.</s>
          <s>During the night photosynthesis is stalled, and carbon used for respiration, metabolite interconversions, or sink export must originate from starch degradation.</s>
          <s>Again, HPs are the central hub for metabolite interconversions.</s>
          <s>Although the HP concentration is in the sub-micromolar range, the simulated flux through this pool was found to be very high, as all carbon will be fixed in the form of HP <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c, d)</ref> and thus, the highest fluxes, CO 2 -fixation and starch synthesis/degradation, will contribute to flux through the HP pool.</s>
          <s>Almost every model showed an HP peak at the beginning of the light phase, especially for gin2-1 models.</s>
          <s>To test if this was real, we sampled gin2-1 plants every 10 min during the first hour after light-on under high light condition to maximize the light effect and analyzed HP content.</s>
          <s>We were unable to confirm this peak in the samples <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>We therefore conclude that it is an artifact, probably arising from the on/off behavior of the CO 2fixation and the 2-h time resolution of the metabolic profile used for model simulations.</s>

          <s>Each of these steps addressed a limitation of the previous model, thus allowing to refine understanding of essential features of the metabolic system.</s>
          <s>For example, a strict switch between starch synthesis and degradation was necessary to prevent overflow of the hexose-phosphate pool (Model 01 vs. 02, compare Figures S1 and S2), a constant respiratory activity over the full diurnal cycle was necessary to prevent deflections in the pool of carbonic and amino acids (Model 02 vs. 03, compare <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Figures S2 and S3)</ref> , and the possibility of interconverting Cit and Mal/Fum was needed to faithfully map levels of carbonic acids (Model 04 vs. 05, compare <ref type="figure">Figures S4 and S5)</ref> .</s>
          <s>A more detailed explanation of each modeling step is given in the supplementary material (Text_S1, "Model characteristics").</s>
          <s>Despite increasing complexity, the model retained its accuracy, as the values for the cost function did not rise to values higher 0.018 <ref target="#tab_2" type="table">(Table 3)</ref> , while representation of the in vivo situation became more exact.</s>
          <s>The final model was used to simulate the dataset for the high light conditions without additional modifications, thus underlining the general validity of the approach.</s>
          <s>Under normal light conditions ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref> , the models were able to accurately predict concentrations of most metabolites, except for HP in gin2-1.</s>
          <s>Here, three artificial peaks occurred: the first right after light-on, a second at 6 h into the light, and the third at the day/night transition.</s>
          <s>Both genotypes displayed steady gain of structural carbon during the day, but not during the night.</s>
          <s>This is not an obvious outcome, since carbon flux from metabolite degradation (e.g.</s>

          <s>This .</s>
          <s>e,f glucose (blue), sucrose (turquois), fructose (green), and hexose phosphates (olive) excess carbon could have been allocated to shoot structural carbon formation in the night.</s>
          <s>However, in optimal simulations, the excess carbon was allocated to the sink tissue.</s>
          <s>Sink export occurred throughout the whole diurnal cycle for Ler under both conditions and for gin2-1 under high light.</s>
          <s>However, mean export rates were 2-2.5-fold higher for Ler (day, night control: 9.4 C 6 /h, 4.8 C 6 /h; day, night high light: 21 C 6 /h, 8 C 6 /h) and 5-to 10-fold higher for gin2-1 (day/night control: 11.5 C 6 /h, 1.1 C 6 /h; day/night high light: 30 C 6 /h, 6.5 C 6 /h) during the day than during the night, and the export rates for gin2-1 during the day were generally 1.2to 1.5-fold higher than the export rates for Ler.</s>
          <s>Although gin2-1 had a low sink export rate during the night under control conditions, export still sufficed for roots maintenance metabolism.</s>
          <s>The higher sink export in gin2-1 resulted in an equal reduction in shoot structural carbon formation.</s>
          <s>This points to an important role of hexokinase-1 in carbon allocation by coordinating sucrose cycling and sugar sensing.</s>
          <s>Simulations of the final model for high light are shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> .</s>
          <s>Minor miss-alignments were observed for Mal/Fum in Ler and gin2-1 and for Frc in Ler.</s>
          <s>Except for soluble sugars, only small differences in metabolite concentrations between the two genotypes were observed.</s>
          <s>However, large deviations occurred for structural carbon.</s>
          <s>For both genotypes, the curve of structural carbon gain showed constant rise for the source tissue during the light phase with a delay of 6 h at dawn in Ler that was absent in gin2-1.</s>
          <s>Shoot structural carbon gain was not more than 3 µmol C 6 gFW −1 during the night and therefore negligible for both genotypes and conditions.</s>

          <s>With non-limiting water and CO 2 supply, net photosynthesis is expected to increase with illumination intensity until it reaches an optimum, at which further increase in light intensity may cause damage to photosystems.</s>
          <s>We indeed observed a 2.4-to 2.5-fold increase in carbon fixation rate for Ler and gin2-1, when the light intensity was raised from 120 to 1200 µmol m −2 s −1 .</s>
          <s>Although photosynthetic CO 2 fixation did increase by the same ratio in both genotypes, leaf structural carbon formation behaved, as expected, in an opposite way: it increased in Ler but decreased in gin2-1.</s>

          <s>Brauner et al. <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26</ref> reported that higher photosynthetic efficiency of gin2-1 did not translate into a higher growth rate because of elevated assimilate export to the root system, where respiratory activity was increased.</s>

          <s>According to Meyer et al. <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27</ref> high growth rates correlate with a metabolic signature comprising low levels of central metabolites like hexose phosphates, sucrose, and carboxylates, thus indicating that fast growth drains the pools of central metabolites.</s>
          <s>Comparing Ler and the gin2-1 mutant, we detected lower levels of sugars and malate in gin2-1 under high light conditions, while hexose phosphates remained unchanged (see <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. S9)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, insufficient build-up of central metabolites could be the cause of slower growth, and elevated sugar export might be its consequence.</s>

          <s>All model simulations placed leaf structural carbon formation into the light phase with almost constant rates that declined within the last 2 h of the light phase, except for Ler under control condition, where structural carbon gain ceased already 6 h before the night.</s>

          <s>Although about one-fifth (15%) of the photosynthetic activity was used to build up starch during the light phase under normal light, and about 30-35% under high light, not only structural carbon formation but also assimilate export were strongly decreased during the night in model simulations.</s>
