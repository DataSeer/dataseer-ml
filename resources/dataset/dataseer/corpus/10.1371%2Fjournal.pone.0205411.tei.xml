          <s>The use of dental implants constitutes a revolution in dentistry by restoring the tooth function in partially or fully edentulous patients.</s>
          <s>Approximately two million dental implants are placed worldwide each year <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

          <s>Peri-implant inflammation might be induced by oral bacterial biofilms and leads to gradual tissue destruction and eventual implant loss <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to a recent meta-analysis, the median prevalence of peri-implant infections is 26% for patients with at least 5 years implant function time and 21.2% with at least 10 years <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, novel antibacterial implant materials and surfaces are proposed in order to minimize the biofilmrelated dental implant failure.</s>
          <s>For instance, surface coatings or laser-structured and liquidinfused surfaces have been shown to be antibacterial <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

            <ref type="bibr">PLOS</ref> An intact biological seal, which is formed by the gingival tissue, around the implants is important for the success of implantation.</s>
          <s>The gingival soft tissue including the epithelial cells and the fibroblasts constitutes the first biological barrier against oral bacteria <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>

            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The gingival fibroblasts belong to the major gingival tissue cell types and are responsible for the normal connective tissue turnover, inflammatory response, wound healing, and regeneration <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>

          <s>The results from a recent study showed that oral fibroblasts are able to modulate the response of macrophages to bacterial exposure <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>After dental implant installation, gingival fibroblasts form a collagen-rich connective tissue.</s>
          <s>This healthy tissue repopulates the wound leading to a soft-tissue seal.</s>
          <s>A good soft-tissue-implant interface, which is initiated by gingival fibroblasts, is required to form a barrier against bacterial penetration and parallel inhibition of epithelial downgrowth <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, many studies in the field of dental implant testing have been conducted using gingival fibroblasts <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>

          <s>The novel implant materials are typically examined for their antibacterial properties and cellular biocompatibility in 2D cultures with oral biofilms or tissue cells, respectively.</s>
          <s>Their examination has been terminal, using end-point microscopy or biochemical assays <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>

          <s>In order to include several time points during material testing, many material samples are required, if terminal examination methods are applied.</s>
          <s>Non-invasive imaging techniques permit to monitor the progression of events within a single sample.</s>
          <s>Non-invasive examination has been used in dentistry for the in vivo examination of gingival tissue applying different techniques like confocal laser scanning microscopy, cone-beam computerized imaging, and optical coherence tomography <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>

          <s>However, the dental implants have a cylindrical geometrical setting, which is also not reflected by the standard 2D test systems.</s>
          <s>The 2D test systems using flat samples permit a high-throughput screening as well as microscopic examination in parallel to molecular or biochemical investigation.</s>
          <s>Spatiotemporal information on how the condition of tissue cells progress and any other topographical effects along the cylindrical implant cannot be gained using these systems.</s>
          <s>Even though only surface information from the implant is needed, which can be displayed in a 2D image, the 3D geometry of the implant itself requires a 3D imaging technique to visualize the full surface.</s>
          <s>A three-dimensional non-invasive biofilm imaging technique on dental implants has been established via scanning laser optical tomography (SLOT).</s>
          <s>This technique allowed the visualization of the biofilm growth over the whole implant <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A similar visualization of gingival cell reactions on the implant material would complement the noninvasive and three-dimensional implant examination as well as the well-established standard 2D methods.</s>

            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For the 3D implant examination, a peri-implant model was required including human gingival cells.</s>
          <s>In order to represent the implant-cell interface, a titanium cylinder was colonized with human gingival fibroblasts.</s>
          <s>This fibroblastcolonized implant was embedded in a supporting matrix for the development of the 3D periimplant model.</s>
          <s>It was essential to fulfill the appropriate preconditions for a compatible, stable, clear, and non-autofluorescent matrix, thus several hydrogels were tested.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, a non-toxic staining protocol for long-term LIVE/DEAD imaging suitable for SLOT was necessary.</s>
          <s>The combination of SLOT with the newly developed peri-implant model and the LIVE/ DEAD staining method enabled the three-dimensional long-term visualization of cell death progression along the implant.</s>
