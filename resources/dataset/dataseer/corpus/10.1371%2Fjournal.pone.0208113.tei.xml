            <s>Cardiac arrest is an event with a limited prognosis which has not substantially changed since the first description of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in 1960.</s>
            <s>A promising new treatment approach may be mechanical CPR devices (mechanical CPR).</s>

          <p>
            <s>In a retrospective analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry between 2007-2014, we examined the outcome after using mechanical CPR on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).</s>
            <s>We compared mechanical CPR to manual CPR.</s>
            <s>According to preclinical risk factors, we calculated the predicted ROSC-after-cardiac-arrest (RACA) score for each group and compared it to the rate of ROSC observed.</s>
            <s>Using multivariate analysis, we adjusted the influence of the devices' application on ROSC for epidemiological factors and therapeutic measures.</s>

            <s>We included 19,609 patients in the study.</s>
            <s>ROSC was achieved in 51.5% of the mechanical CPR group (95%-CI 48.2-54.8%,</s>
            <s>ROSC expected 42.5%) and in 41.2% in the manual CPR group (95%-CI 40.4-41.9%,</s>
            <s>ROSC expected 39.2%).</s>
            <s>After multivariate adjustment, mechanical CPR was found to be an independent predictor of ROSC (OR 1.77; 95%-CI 1.48-2.12).</s>
            <s>Duration of CPR is a key determinant for achieving ROSC.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In our study, the use of mechanical CPR devices tend to a ROSC rate that exceeded the expected rate calculated using the RACA score.</s>
          <s>After adjustment for influencing factors, mechanical CPR remained a significant predictor of ROSC, independent of CPR duration.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Considering that resuscitation attempts of less than five minutes had been excluded from our analysis, our data support the hypothesis that the application of the devices may increase survival, especially in particular indications like prolonged CPR.</s>
          <s>We consider these findings as important because data about the practical application and benefits from mechanical CPR devices has been limited to date, with many of the conclusions derived from extrapolations of related medical fields or animal experiments.</s>
          <s>Registries represent the real-life resuscitation environment therefore our analysis constitutes an important addition to clinical and experimental trials.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>While our results suggest a benefit of mechanical CPR devices, it is important to emphasise that the use of these devices should be limited to particular circumstances.</s>
          <s>For example, mechanical CPR devices may not be suitable for use for patients with certain anatomical conditions or traumatic injuries.</s>
          <s>Trained ALS providers will be able to adjust chest compressions to the individual needs of such patients, whereas a device will not.</s>
          <s>Another important consideration is that in order to attach a mechanical CPR device properly to a patient, CPR has to be interrupted causing a lower compression fraction.</s>

            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">15]</ref> As for any other resuscitation measure the best moment to establish mechanical CPR during the resuscitation process must be considered.</s>
          <s>Finally, in our study we included only cases where the resuscitation attempt had Application of mechanical CPR-devices and their value in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest exceeded five minutes.</s>
          <s>This is because use of mechanical CPR is not indicated in resuscitation attempts of short duration, as the outcome in this early period is not affected by the CPR mode.</s>
          <s>As the duration of a resuscitation attempt becomes prolonged, more invasive measures may be used to try and prevent the imminent death of a patient.</s>
          <s>In such scenarios, an emergency physician's decision is required if mechanical CPR is indicated or not to avoid overtreatment of patients who have no prospect of survival.</s>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[20]</ref> The PARAMEDIC trial also failed to show any significant differences in survival, reporting even worse neurological outcome after LUCAS CPR.</s>

            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[21]</ref> A recently updated Cochrane Review investigated the application of mechanical CPR devices in six different trials and found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude either benefit or harm from these mechanical devices and advised that more studies are needed.</s>

          <s>Generally, observational studies can demonstrate associations, but not causation.</s>
          <s>Data quality depends on the participants' documentation accuracy.</s>
          <s>We had to exclude 37.3% of the datasets due to missing entries.</s>
          <s>Participation is on a voluntary basis, and not all German EMS systems contribute to the database.</s>
          <s>As it is not mandatory, each EMS system may decide on its own whether or not to implement mechanical CPR devices into their ALS algorithm.</s>
          <s>Little is known about the background of the patients, and their preexisting conditions, however this is the case for the majority of OHCA studies.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we do not know the exact circumstances of the resuscitation attempt.</s>
          <s>For example, we do not have information about interruptions or the no-flow time, complications that may have occurred, or compression depth.</s>
          <s>As an endpoint, ROSC can easily be obtained, but ROSC is only a surrogate parameter for survival.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, in most of the cases follow-up was not reported to the registry by admitting hospitals.</s>
          <s>Hence, in our study we could not follow longterm outcome parameters like survival and neurological state at hospital discharge.</s>
