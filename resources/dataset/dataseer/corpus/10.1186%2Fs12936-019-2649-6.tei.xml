            <s>Background: In several Apicomplexa, the formation of moving junctions (MJs) at the interface between the external membranes of the invading parasite and the host cell is essential for the process of parasite invasion.</s>
            <s>In Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, the MJ is composed of the Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) and Rhoptry Neck Proteins (RONs) complex; specifically, AMA1 interacts with RON2 during host cell invasion.</s>

            <s>The structural studies of peptides were performed by circular dichroism, and the structural analysis of the complex of PvAMA1 with peptides based on PvRON2 (D2035-T2074) was conducted with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Results: Surface plasmon resonance (KD = 23.91 ± 2.078 μmol/L) and ITC (K = 3 × 10 5 mol/L) studies conclusively showed an interaction between the cyclic peptide based on PvRON2 and PvAMA1-His 6 .</s>
            <s>In contrast, the linear peptide and recombinant PvRON2 (GST fusion protein) did not show an interaction with PvAMA1.</s>
            <s>However, the interaction among recombinant proteins PvRON2.2 and PvAMA1-His 6 was possible to show by far western blot.</s>

          <s>Despite the use of AMA1 for vaccine development, little is known about the function of this protein or the antibodies induced by natural infection or immunization with recombinant proteins.</s>
          <s>In the specific case of P. vivax, the absence of efficient and continuous in vitro culture systems has imposed limitations on in vitro testing of potential vaccine candidates <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, protection studies are complex because this species does not infect rodents.</s>
          <s>The functional importance of PvAMA1 in invasion is derived from a study in which antibodies induced by immunization with recombinant PvAMA1 were able to partially inhibit the red blood cell re-invasion ex vivo <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The formation of a moving junction (MJ) at the interface between the external membranes of the invading parasite and the host cell is apparently a common feature across the Apicomplexa phylum <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent studies with Toxoplasma gondii and P. falciparum showed that AMA1, which is secreted from micronemes, interacts with Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (RON2) during the host cell invasion <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , and the sequence and structural data from the AMA1 and RON2 proteins suggest that their interaction is highly conserved across the Apicomplexa phylum <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it has been hypothesized that this complex is conserved in P. vivax, and this AMA1-RON2 interaction offers potential for the development of anti-infective (vaccines and/or drugs) strategies.</s>
          <s>In fact, during the development of the present study, two other works showed the interaction of peptides and recombinant proteins based on PvRON2 and PvAMA1 <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>

          <s>In 2017, Vulliez Le Normand et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> showed that a 39-residue peptide based on PvRON2 presented crossreactivity between AMA1 of P. vivax and P. falciparum.</s>
          <s>Their results showed that between P. falciparum and P. vivax, some intermolecular contacts are common to the AMA1/RON2 pair, while others are particular to certain species; the RON2 ligand adapts to sequence differences in the AMA1 binding groove.</s>
          <s>For this reason, PvAMA1-DII-III is able to bind to both PvAMA1 and PfAMA1 in spite of some differences in the intermolecular interactions.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, Bermudez et al. <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> showed a stronger interaction of PvRON2 with PvAMA1-DII-III than with the PvAMA1 ectodomain or PvAMA1-DI-II, suggesting that other PvAMA1 regions may participate in the interaction with PvRON2.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, they also demonstrated that another PvRON2 functional region located towards the central region participates in the interaction with reticulocytes and interacts strongly with PvAMA1.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, several studies showed that antibodies or peptides that prevent formation of the AMA1-RON2 complex also block invasion <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15,</ref>

          <s>According to the results obtained in this work, the disulfide bridge between C2051 and C2063 cause a great conformational restriction to the cyclic peptide.</s>
          <s>This conformational restriction, nonexistent in the linear peptide could help the cyclic peptide to adopt the correct conformation to interact with PvAMA1 showed in the work of Vulliez Le Normand et al. <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Peptide and recombinant protein with an S-S bond between C2051 and C2063 were able to interact with PvAMA1-His 6 .</s>
          <s>The C-to-A and C-to-S (that is chemically similar to C) changes in the recombinant protein and linear peptide respectively, don't show interaction with PvAMA1, proving that the S-S bond between C2051 and C2063 is crucial for the interaction between PvRON2 and PvAMA1.</s>
