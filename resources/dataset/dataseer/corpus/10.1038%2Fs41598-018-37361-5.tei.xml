            <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure 1a</ref> shows a representative STM image of the Tl/Si(111)1×1 surface with ring-shaped defects.</s>
          <s>Previously we proposed a structural model, in which seven Tl atoms of the 1×1 structure are replaced by a single Si ad-atom in a T 4 position 31 (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref> ).</s>
          <s>These extra Si ad-atoms could easily originate from the Si-rich 7 × 7 reconstruction present on the surface prior to the formation of the Tl/Si(111)1×1 structure.</s>
          <s>The model is also consistent with the tendency of Si ad-atoms to substitute Tl during the formation of the mosaic × 3 3 structure at elevated temperatures <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> : the separation of neighboring Si and Tl ad-atoms in the × 3 3 is the same as in the proposed model of the ring-shaped defects.</s>
          <s>The surface density of defects is very sensitive to the preparation parameters, primarily to the smaple heating temperature.</s>
          <s>This is probably caused by a narrow temperature interval between formation of the 1×1 structure and Tl desorption <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34</ref> .</s>
          <s>We note that other less frequent types of defects coexisting with the ring-shaped ones can be observed occasionally <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">32</ref> .</s>
          <s>In order to study the local electronic structure of the defects, we measured scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) curves above the center of the defect, above the edge of the defect, as well as above a Tl atom far from the defect <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig. 2a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most significant feature of the STS obtained above the center is enhanced density of empty states up to sample voltage 0.6 V.</s>
          <s>The enhancement is balanced out by a lower density of occupied states above the defect center compared to the edge and the faraway position.</s>
          <s>The positive charging of the central Si atom and consequent hole doping is consistent with the mechanism proposed previously <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31</ref> : Si dangling bonds of the pristine Tl/Si(111)1×1 structure are saturated by a charge transfer from Tl p orbitals.</s>
          <s>The formation of a Tl multi-vacancy prevents some of the Si dangling bonds to be saturated via Tl atoms.</s>
          <s>The charge from the extra Si atom is therefore transferred to participate in the saturation of these Si dangling bonds.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Figure 2b</ref> shows detailed bias-dependent constant current STM images (top panels) and dI/dV maps (bottom panels) of a selected defect.</s>
          <s>The somewhat lower quality of the images is caused by the simultaneous recording of the current (used as feedback in the topography images shown in the top panels) and the lock-in dI/dV signal (imaged with feedback switched off shown in the bottom panels).</s>
          <s>The STM topography shows just a minor dependence on the sample voltage except a change of the relative contrast of the central and Tl-1×1 areas.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, the dI/dV maps show a stronger dependence -the ring of the defect appears brighter from −0.15 V to 0.3 V, the central position appears brighter at 0.5 V, otherwise the defect is displayed as a depression.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To verify the proposed model of the defect we have calculated the spatial charge distributions of the electronic states contributing to the STM images obtained from the measurements (Figs 1a and 2b).</s>

          <s>Charge distributions of the modeled defect shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> reproduce the enhancement in the ring around the extra Si atom indicated by the STM images (see <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figs 1a and 2b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The ring decoration is strongest at −0.13 eV <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b,g</ref> ) which corresponds to the dI/dV map obtained at −0.15 eV in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> .</s>
          <s>The local density of states (LDOS) associated with the ring is significant even at the Fermi level (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref> ) and consequently this type of defect appears as a bright circle in STM images at a wide range of sample voltages.</s>
          <s>The density of states inside the ring is maximal at 0.5 eV (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3d</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The charge distribution associated with the extra Si atom is visible under some conditions of STM tips <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>

          <s>However, the increased LDOS can be identified in the STS curve (red line in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2a)</ref> as the enhancement between the Fermi level and 0.7 eV.</s>
          <s>Such different sensitivity to the charge density located at the central atom is due to different tip setpoints: the tip is closer to the surface during the STS measurement as tip height is controlled by the feedback loop during STM image acquisition in contrast to the constant height during the dI/dV mapping.</s>

To utilize the spin polarization, doping of the system should be understood on atomic level. We present a study of two types of atomic defects predicted to dope the considered electronic system -Si-induced vacancies and defects associated with the presence of extra Tl atoms. Structural calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) confirm the stability of the proposed defect structure consisting of an extra Si atom and missing seven Tl atoms as proposed in an earlier experimental study. The calculated spatial charge distributions indicate an enhancement of the charge around the extra Si atom, which correctly reproduces topographies of the corresponding scanning tunneling microscopy images while the calculated local densities of states of this system explain obtained scanning tunneling spectra. The DFT structural calculations let us determine the atomic structure of the defect caused by the presence of an extra Tl atom. The calculated spatial charge distributions show a ring-like feature around the extra Tl atom. The obtained results indicate a charge transfer from the central extra Tl atom to its vicinity in the agreement with earlier photoemission measurements.</figDesc>
