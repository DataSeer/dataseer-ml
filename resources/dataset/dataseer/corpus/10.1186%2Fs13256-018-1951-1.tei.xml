            <s>Background: Fever of unknown origin is often a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians due to its extremely broad differential.</s>
            <s>One of the rarer categories of disease causing fever of unknown origin is malignancies; of these, soft tissue sarcoma is one of the least common.</s>
            <s>Soft tissue sarcomas make up &lt; 1% of all adult malignancies and often do not present with any systemic manifestations or neoplastic fevers.</s>
            <s>Case presentation: A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 2-week history of fever and profound fatigue.</s>
            <s>The only other symptom she endorsed was a transient history of left knee pain, initially thought to be unrelated.</s>
            <s>There was no clear cause on initial examination and routine investigations, but her C-reactive protein was significantly elevated at 207 mg/L.</s>
            <s>Blood cultures and a urine culture were drawn.</s>
            <s>She was admitted to hospital for further investigation and placed on empiric antibiotics.</s>
            <s>Her blood cultures were negative, but she had one further fever in hospital.</s>
            <s>Computed tomography scans did not yield a cause of her fever.</s>
            <s>No vegetations were seen on echocardiography.</s>
            <s>Antibiotics were stopped as she did not seem to have an acute infectious cause of her fever.</s>
            <s>No new symptoms developed.</s>
            <s>She felt well enough to proceed with out-patient follow up and was discharged after 8 days in hospital.</s>
            <s>At 1-month post-discharge: no resolution of symptoms, but she endorsed a recurrence of her left knee pain.</s>
            <s>Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4.5 × 6.8 × 11.6 cm soft tissue mass, identified as a sarcoma on biopsy.</s>
            <s>She subsequently underwent a distal femur resection.</s>
            <s>Final staging was pT2bN0M0.</s>
            <s>She underwent adjuvant radiation therapy, but was found to have developed metastatic disease.</s>
            <s>Conclusion: This case revealed an atypical presentation of a rare soft tissue sarcoma as the cause of the illness.</s>
            <s>The etiology behind a fever of unknown origin can be difficult to elucidate, making the approach to investigation particularly important.</s>
            <s>Repeated history-taking and serial physical examinations can be crucial in guiding investigations and ultimately arriving at a diagnosis.</s>
            <s>In addition, we believe this case highlights the adage that no seemingly innocuous symptom should be left out when working up a condition with such an extensive and complex differential.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>The case described is of a patient with non-specific constitutional symptoms, an initial history of transient left knee pain, and the development of a FUO.</s>
          <s>Workup eventually led to the diagnosis of an undifferentiated sarcoma of epithelioid morphology.</s>
          <s>This diagnosis is not only rare in terms of sarcoma incidence rates, but also because of its unusual systemic presentation <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin, representing roughly &lt; 1% of all adult malignancies.</s>
          <s>Approximately 90% of cases of sarcoma are defined as soft tissue sarcomas (STSs): developing in the muscles, deep tissues, blood vessels, nerves, fat, and joints, while the rest are classified as malignant bone tumors <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database indicates that the incidence rates of STS development are highest in children &lt; 5 years of age and in adults &gt; 50-years old, with the lowest incidence found in young adults <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Numerous predisposing factors have been considered and include various genetic, environmental, and iatrogenic entities; however, no definitive or specific etiologies have been identified <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">(Table 1</ref> ) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>STS can be divided extensively by histologic subtypes, for which the World Health Organization (WHO) currently lists more than 100.</s>
          <s>These malignancies can also be described in terms of location and specific histologic morphology.</s>
          <s>Site distribution favors the lower extremities (29%), with tumors less often involving the upper extremities (11%) and trunk (10%) ( <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">Table 2</ref> ) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Morphology is often used as a descriptor for the undifferentiated/unclassified subtype, as was the case with our patient who was discovered to have an undifferentiated sarcoma of epithelioid morphology.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In 1961, Petersdorf and Beeson defined a FUO as consisting of the following three criteria <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> :</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>1) A temperature of &gt; 38.3°C on several occasions, 2) &gt; 3 weeks' duration of illness, and 3) a failure to reach a diagnosis despite 1 week of in-patient investigations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This definition has changed numerous times over the years due to our better understanding of various feverinducing conditions and improved diagnostic capabilities <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most widely used definition now divides FUO into four major categories, each having specific definitions and potential causes <ref target="#tab_2" type="table">(Table 3</ref> ) <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most common category of FUO, and the one relating closest to the case presentation, is the "Classical FUO" subtype.</s>
          <s>A review of 26 studies of FUO shows the common etiologies of this subtype to include: infections (36.2%), malignancies (12.8%), non-infectious inflammatory diseases (20.9%), miscellaneous (6.2%), and undiagnosed (23.7%) <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The presence of FUO and neoplastic-based fevers with bone or STSs, as was the case with our patient, is not extensively reported in literature.</s>
          <s>In a cohort of 195 patients with bone and STSs who were admitted for treatment, 58 (30%) developed a fever while in hospital.</s>
          <s cert="0.9828770756721497" id="dataset-3" type="Tabular data">Neoplastic fever was determined to be the cause in only 11 (6%) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Due to the extensive number of other potential etiologies that could be responsible for FUO, the workup can be complex and extensive.</s>
          <s>An important part of this workup is obtaining a detailed history, as the major categories of classical FUO have distinct clinical hallmarks.</s>
          <s>Constitutional symptoms, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and malaise typify malignant/neoplastic etiologies of FUO.</s>
          <s>However, these vague symptoms need to be correlated to physical examination findings, laboratory studies, and diagnostic imaging, to make a definitive diagnosis.</s>
          <s>A retrospective review of 383 patients found that the mean time to diagnosis of a neoplastic cause of FUO after admission was 15.7 days <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This case, where extensive workup involved both in-patient and out-patient investigations lasting over 1 month, highlights the importance of a detailed history and repeated examinations when evaluating FUO.</s>
          <s>This patient initially had a history of transient left knee pain, which was previously investigated with only X-rays.</s>
          <s>When symptoms recurred, a focused physical examination of the area, as well as additional imaging studies, led to the diagnosis.</s>
          <s>Time to diagnosis may have been shortened should this history of knee pain been investigated earlier.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Investigation of FUO, guided by patient history and physical examination findings, should begin with a broad systematic approach to narrow the differential as efficiently <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> Case report timeline of events.</s>
          <s>BP blood pressure, bpm beats per minute, CRP C-reactive protein, CT computed tomography, ED emergency department, HR heart rate, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, RA room air, Sat saturation, T temperature as possible.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#tab_4" type="table">Table 5</ref> outlines a practical approach for the initial workup of FUO.</s>
          <s>Imaging techniques, such as fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, play an increasingly important role in the investigation of FUO without any diagnostic clues.</s>
          <s>One review found FDG-PET/CT contributed to determining the final causal diagnosis in FUO in 38-75% of cases <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, a systematic review examining data from 16 trials found that PET/CT imaging was 90% sensitive and 89% specific for overall diagnostic accuracy in osseous and STSs <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, this imaging modality was not utilized in this case.</s>
          <s>Whether or not its use would have led to an earlier diagnosis is something that could be considered given the above data.</s>
          <s>Prognosis is variable in FUO, reflecting the multitude of potential etiologies <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Overall, 12-35% of patients die from FUO-related causes, with malignant etiologies having the highest 5-year mortality at 52-100% <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This sharply contrasts with the 5-year mortality rate of 3.2% in those patients who remain undiagnosed after an extensive evaluation.</s>
          <s>Spontaneous recovery from FUO can occur in 51-100% of patients <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the current era, limb sparing treatment procedures are often the preferred management option for STS.</s>
          <s>Along with surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be a key component to the management of STS.</s>
          <s>As was the case with our patient who had a grade 3 STS, most moderate to high-grade STSs receive adjuvant radiotherapy.</s>
          <s>The combination of local resection and radiotherapy has similar survival and recurrence rates as amputation, but with the added benefit of functional preservation <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the role for adjuvant chemotherapy is more controversial and is dependent on the histologic subtype and morphology of the tumor, as well as the presence of metastases <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although our patient did develop metastatic disease, she had opted to pursue palliative care in lieu of further aggressive treatment.</s>

        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, determining an etiology in a patient with FUO can be challenging due to the breadth of possibilities.</s>
          <s>It is not only challenging, but FUO often represents an atypical presentation of a disease.</s>
          <s>This case provides such an example and aims to highlight the extensive workup required.</s>
          <s>In addition, it supports the adage that a full detailed history and examination is often a necessity when evaluating FUO; repeated history and examinations may be needed, with no symptom being viewed as irrelevant.</s>
          <s>Findings then must be used to direct further investigations.</s>
          <s>An investigatory approach is outlined in this case report and aims to provide clinicians a foundation from which to work from in the workup of similar cases.</s>
