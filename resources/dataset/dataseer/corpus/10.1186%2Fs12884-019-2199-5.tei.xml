            <s>Background: The ability to adopt and implement health promotion behaviors is one of the most important determinants of health status.</s>
            <s>Various factors affect the successful changing of behaviors and choosing a healthy lifestyle.</s>
            <s>The present study aims at exploring the experiences of overweight pregnant women in terms of the factors influencing selection and adoption of health promoting behaviors during pregnancy.</s>
            <s>Methods: This qualitative study reports the findings of individual and group in-depth interviews with 32 overweight pregnant women using semi-structured questions which was conducted in Tabriz-Iran in 2017 and lasted for 6 months.</s>
            <s>The data collection continued until the saturation of the data.</s>
            <s>Participants were selected using purposive sampling and study inclusion criteria.</s>

            <s>Thereafter, content analysis was made using MAXQDA v. 10.</s>
            <s>Strength of data was verified by both participants and external control.</s>

            <s>Individual barriers (disabilities-additional needs in pregnancy and mental barriers) 2. Socio-environmental barriers (adverse effects of the environment, adverse effects of the relatives and financial pressures) 3. Individual facilitators (intrinsic incentives, abundance and individual skills) 4. Socio-environmental (social and family support, incentive environments, and raising awareness).</s>
            <s>Conclusion: The adoption of health behaviors and healthy lifestyle is under the mutual influence of individual characteristics and socio-environmental factors.</s>
            <s>What should be considered in planning and designing interventions is focused on removing barriers and strengthening facilitators, in particular by moderating social factors and taking into account individual needs and personal expectations.</s>

          <s>Understanding the importance of changing behaviors is one of the determinants of adopting the health-related behaviors because pregnant women tend to change to positive behaviors because of their health concerns for their infants.</s>
          <s>For this reason, pregnancy can be a good time for adopting health measures.</s>
          <s>So, this opportunity should be used well and what should be considered in the planning and design of interventions is the focus on removing barriers and strengthening facilitators, especially by moderating social factors and taking into account individual needs and personal expectations.</s>

I spend most of my time in the office; I don't have 
enough time for myself. I'm often tired when I get 
home from work. Sometimes I cannot even drink a 
glass of water in 10 h. I do not have the opportunity 
to get something extra (p.1)

Perceived 
barriers 

I wish I had enough time to go to gym; or, the 
opportunities to change my diet. I spend several 
hours standing, my feel swell, I don't have the 
opportunity to sit down (p.1) 

Lack of opportunities 

Sometimes I feel like doing something, but I'm 
not in the mood. I'm becoming lazy (p.2) 

Lack of readiness and 
motivation 

Lack of information 
and motivation 

I don't know enough about the pregnancy 
exercises (p.3) 

Lack of enough information 

It's hard to get out of home, my belly is becoming 
bigger, its embarrass 

Shame 
Internal inhibitors 

I think there should not be heavy exercising, it may 
lead to preterm delivery (p.5) 

Negative thought 

The healthcare centers told me that I am overweight 
and the deliver preterm. I'm fearful and worried (p.6) 

Fear 

I think I'm going to miss my husband. Now he pays 
a lot of attention to me and loves me, I feel 
something will happen during the pregnancy and I 
will miss him (p.4) 

Worrying 

Of course one may think the birth date will be 
premature and we have no time to arrange 
what we have planned for (p.7)
