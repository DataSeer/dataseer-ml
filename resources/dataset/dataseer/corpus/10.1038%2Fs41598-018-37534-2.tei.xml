            <s>Using several empirical data sets of social temporal networks, we show that our method is capable of inferring the system's states such as distinct activities in a school and a weekday state as opposed to a weekend state.</s>

          <s>Many systems composed of interacting elements can be represented as networks, and nowadays it can be quite easy to obtain large amounts of interactions from such a system.</s>
          <s>One challenge for network science 1,2 is to condense the information obtained from such streams of data into simplified, more narrative, pictures of what happens in the system.</s>
          <s>For networks that are static in time, this has been well studied as the problem of community detection in networks <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, many networks in the real world are changing over time.</s>
          <s>This change is interesting in its own right because it reflects the forces acting upon the system.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, if the timescale of network change is similar to that of dynamic processes relevant to the system (e.g., information spreading, gene expression, transportation), the dynamics of the network might affect, and be affected by, the dynamics on the network.</s>
          <s>As a consequence, traditional network theory developed for static networks may not apply.</s>
          <s>Coarse-graining the data (i.e., inferring the meso-scale structure of a network such as communities) is one such example, where straightforward generalizations from static networks do not work.</s>
          <s>This knowledge gap motivates the study of temporal (i.e., time-varying) networks, in which nodes and/or edges are time-stamped.</s>
          <s>We now know that the temporality of networks does change our understanding of networks in many cases and provides us with richer information and more efficient manipulative tools <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>

          <s>Let us consider human social behaviour as an example.</s>
          <s>Research has shown that human behaviour can often be accurately modelled by dynamical processes depending on discrete states.</s>
          <s>For example, email correspondence behaviour of individuals was modelled as a two-state point process in which an individual was assumed to switch between an active state and a normal state, supplemented by circadian and weekly modulations of the event rate <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>The event rate in the active rate was assumed to be larger than that in the normal state.</s>
          <s>A similar model accounted for historical letter correspondence behaviour of celebrity <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>These and other <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>

            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> discrete-state models have been useful in explaining empirical data such as long-tailed distributions of inter-event times.</s>
          <s>The philosophy underlying these models is that a system such as an individual human can be modelled by a sequence of discrete states between which the system stochastically switches (akin to the dynamics in a hidden Markov model <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16</ref> ).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the present study, we hypothesise that the state of a networked system as a whole, rather than behaviour of individual nodes, is encoded in the edges (i.e., pairwise interactions) of the network and can be summarized as a time series of state changes.</s>
          <s>An obvious example of this would be day-time versus night-time states of human interaction, with the former possibly having more frequent interaction than the latter.</s>
          <s>Another type of state change may be between weekdays and weekends <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>Biological, ecological, engineered and other temporal networks 4,6 may also be characterised by switching behaviour.</s>
          <s>We show in the present study that we can distinguish discrete states of temporal networks that have similar event rates nevertheless different in internal structure of the time-stamped network.</s>
          <s>We also show that such different states are often interpretable.</s>
          <s>We refer to the inferred transitory dynamics between discrete states as system state dynamics of temporal networks (or simply state dynamics).</s>
          <s>To determine the state dynamics, we use distance measures for static graphs to categorise static networks at different times, which we call the snapshots, into groups; we regard each group as a state of the temporal network.</s>
          <s>Change-point and anomaly detection for temporal networks is also concerned with detecting changes of networks over time <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref>

            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A main difference between our system state dynamics and these methods is that detection of system state dynamics is concerned with not only the change, but what is before and after the change.</s>
          <s>System states are furthermore recurrent by nature.</s>
          <s>If a state is visited only once in the entire observation period, it would be practically unclear whether to regard it as a state characterising the system or as an anomaly.</s>
          <s>While change-point detection focus on the change, our approach is more akin to dimensional reduction 22 of the network.</s>

          <s>Comparison between different distance measures on classification of static networks.</s>
          <s>Before analysing temporal networks, we first compared static networks generated by different models.</s>
          <s>The purpose of this analysis was to compare performances of the different graph distance measures introduced in section 2.1 in distinguishing static network samples generated by two different models (or one model with two different parameter values).</s>
          <s>This exercise is relevant to our method because, in our method, snapshots of a temporal network are clustered into groups (i.e., states) according to a measure of graph distance between pairs of snapshots, which are static networks.</s>
          <s>Therefore, a graph distance measure that yields a good discrimination performance for the static networks in this section is expected to be also a good performer in the next section, where we calculate state dynamics of temporal networks for empirical data sets.</s>
          <s>We seek such good performers in this section.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In fact, the event rate averaged over all pairs of nodes and a time window is one of the simplest measurements of temporal networks.</s>
          <s>We are not interested in the states of temporal networks that simply correspond to different event rates.</s>
          <s>Therefore, in this section, we compared two ensembles of static networks with approximately the same edge density.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>First, we compared the regular random graph (RRG) and the Barabási-Albert (BA) model <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">44</ref> .</s>
          <s>We generated RRGs using the configuration model with N = 100 nodes and the degree of each node equal to six.</s>
          <s>We generated networks from the BA model with parameters m 0 = 3 and m = 3, where m 0 is the number of nodes that initially form a clique in the process of growing a network, and m is the number of edges that each new node added to the network initially has.</s>
          <s>These parameter values yield mean degree ≈6, while the degree obeys a power-law distribution with power-law exponent three.</s>
          <s>In the BA model, the node index is randomly assigned to the N nodes, and therefore the node index is not correlated with the age or the degree of the node.</s>
          <s>For each distance measure, we carried out the following three comparisons.</s>
          <s>First, we calculated the distance between two networks generated by the RRG.</s>
          <s>Second, we calculated the distance between two degree-heterogeneous networks generated by the BA model.</s>
          <s>Third, we calculated the distance between a network generated by the RRG and a network generated by the BA model.</s>
          <s>In each case, we generated 10 3 pairs of networks and calculated the average and standard deviation of the distance between a pair of networks.</s>
          <s>All the networks used in these comparisons are independent samples.</s>
          <s>The values of the distance are shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2(a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The distance values were scaled such that the average distance between the RRG and BA model corresponds to one in the figure.</s>
          <s>The figure indicates that, for the edit distance and DELTACON, the distance between the RRG and BA model is not significantly larger than between a pair of RRGs and between a pair of BA networks.</s>
          <s>These distance measures would take small values when edges between particular pairs of nodes exist in both of the two networks.</s>
          <s>Because the RRG and BA models are stochastic algorithms, this situation does not often happen even for a pair of networks generated by the same model.</s>
          <s>In applications to temporal networks, it is probably too demanding to require that events between the same pair of nodes should happen in many node pairs for two snapshots to be judged to be similar.</s>
          <s>The Jensen-Shannon divergence discriminates the RRG and BA when β = 1 but not when β = 0.1 or β = 10.</s>
          <s>The other four spectral distance measures discriminate the RRG and the BA model in the sense that the RRG-BA distance is significantly larger than the RRG-RRG and BA-BA distances.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We next turn to another pair of models, which are the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) benchmark with different parameter values.</s>
          <s>The LFR benchmark generates networks with community structure 45 .</s>
          <s>The model creates networks having a heterogeneous degree distribution and a heterogeneous distribution of community size.</s>
          <s>Parameter μ tunes the extent of mixing of different communities, such that a fraction μ of edges incident to each node goes to different communities.</s>
          <s>A small value of μ implies a strong community structure.</s>
          <s>We compare networks generated with μ = 0.1 and those generated with μ = 0.9.</s>
          <s>We set N = 100, the mean degree to six, the largest degree to N/4 = 25, the power-law exponent for the degree distribution to two and the power-law exponent for the distribution of community size to one.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the degree distribution is independent of μ.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the two groups of networks to be compared differ in the strength of the community structure but not in the degree distribution, presenting a more difficult classification problem than the previous one.</s>
          <s>For example, the edges of a social temporal network in a primary school 39 are mostly confined within classes during the classroom time, corresponding to strong community structure.</s>
          <s>In contrast, pupils tend to be mixed across classes during playtime, probably corresponding to weak community structure.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The network distance is compared between pairs of networks generated with μ = 0.1 and 0.9 in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2(b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The discrimination between μ = 0.1 and μ = 0.9 is unsuccessful with the edit distance in the sense that the distance between μ = 0.1 and μ = 0.9 is not statistically larger than that between a pair of LFR networks generated with the same μ values.</s>
          <s>With DELTACON, the distance between μ = 0.1 and μ = 0.9 is significantly larger than the other two cases.</s>
          <s>However, the values of the distance are close among the three cases.</s>
          <s>The Jensen-Shannon spectral divergence also fails for the three values of β.</s>
          <s>The unnormalised and normalised spectral distances are not successful when they are combined with the combinatorial Laplacian matrix, which is presumably for the following reason.</s>
          <s>The community structure and the lack thereof are reflected by the small eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">46,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">47</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, the largest eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix is proportional to the largest node degree in the network <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">48</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because the largest degree depends on samples of networks, the fluctuation in the largest eigenvalue would be a dominant contributor to the spectral distance.</s>
          <s>Then, the spectral distance under-represents the discrepancy between small eigenvalues in the two networks, which are related to community structure, in particular for degree-heterogeneous networks.</s>
          <s>In contrast, <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2(b)</ref> indicates that the spectral distances applied to the normalised Laplacian matrices discriminate between LFR networks with μ = 0.1 and those with μ = 0.9.</s>
          <s>It should be noted that the largest eigenvalue of the normalised Laplacian matrix does not scale with the largest degree of the node in the network, i.e., λ N ≤ 2 <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">30,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">31</ref> .</s>
          <s>Given the results shown in <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> , in the next section, we will focus on the two spectral distance measures applied to normalized Laplacian matrices of snapshots of temporal networks.</s>

          <s>In this section, we examine state dynamics in empirical temporal networks.</s>

          <s>The choice of τ is arbitrary and is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> .</s>

          <s>The panel to the bottom is the time series of the state of the temporal network.</s>
          <s>Dunn's index suggested two states, i.e., a lunch-time state and a class-time state, with both spectral distance measures.</s>
          <s>The present results are consistent with an analysis of a single day of the same data set using graph signal processing <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">49</ref> .</s>

          <s>Similar results were obtained for the Cambridge data set with τ = 1 hour.</s>

          <s>Some of the states are characterised by different mean activity rates (large event rates in states 7, 8, 10 and 11 and small event rates in state 3 and 4 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(a)</ref> ; large event rates in states 3 and 5 and small event rates in states 6, 8 and 9 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(b)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, other states are not simply characterised by the mean event rate.</s>
          <s>For example, state 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(a)</ref> , equivalently, state 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(b)</ref> , is composed of earlier snapshots with elevated event rates and later snapshots with un-elevated event rates.</s>
          <s>In addition, state 5 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(a)</ref> , equivalently, state 7 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(b)</ref> , appears in two chunks of time that are separated by many hours.</s>

          <s>A limitation of the present approach is the assumption that the entire system can be described by a single system state.</s>
          <s>In fact, we found nontrivial interpretable results in only one of the four data sets that we investigated (i.e., primary school data set).</s>
          <s>In many cases, one could argue that it makes more sense to describe different groups in the data as having their own system state.</s>
          <s>If our method is complemented by a community detection component, this problem could be circumvented.</s>
          <s>However, community detection in temporal networks is notoriously hard to tackle with a principled approach <ref target="#b68" type="bibr">70</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another limitation is arbitrariness in the choice of the subroutines and parameter values.</s>
          <s>For example, there are myriads of distance measures for networks <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">27</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, hierarchical clustering comes with various options in how to connect different clusters, and there are many other data clustering methods <ref target="#b69" type="bibr">71</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, there are other methods for determining the number of groups apart from the Dunn's index <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">35</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our choice of the length of the time window was also arbitrary.</s>
          <s>The purpose of the present study was to present a new characterisation of temporal networks.</s>
          <s>More exhaustive examinations of these variations are left as future work.</s>

        <figDesc>Distance between pairs of static networks with seven graph distance measures. (a) Regular random graphs (denoted by RRG) and the BA model. (b) LFR model with different parameter values. The bar graphs present the average of the distance values over 10 3 pairs of networks sampled from each model. The distance values are normalised by that for the average of the distance between (a) the RRG and BA pair or (b) the LFR network with μ = 0.1 and that with μ = 0.9. The error bars represent a standard deviation calculated from the 10 3 pairs of networks. Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:795 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37534-2</figDesc>
