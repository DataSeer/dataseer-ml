          <s>In our study, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the Adult group had a significantly better event-free survival curve than the Child group.</s>
          <s>However, the dose-response curves were not significantly different between the Adult and Child groups, which implies the survival difference might be not due to the dose-response relationship.</s>
          <s>Even though we matched the preoperative deviation angle, sex, and the length of follow-up time, the refractive errors, simultaneous vertical strabismus, and the type of surgery were still different between the two groups.</s>

          <s>However, in multivariate weighted cox proportional hazard regression analysis of the Adult and Child groups, none of these factors was a significant risk factor for recurrence.</s>
          <s>Not conducting the adjustable suture and poorer office control were marginally associated with recurrence in univariate weighted cox proportional analysis, but these two factors were not included in the multivariate analysis.</s>
          <s>Instead, a larger preoperative angle, the divergence excess type, and a younger age at operation were the significant risk factors for recurrence in the multivariate analysis.</s>

          <s>However, other studies have found that a larger preoperative angle was associated with recurrence <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref>

            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Our results also showed that the larger preoperative angle is a significant factor for recurrence (HR = 1.046,</s>

          <s>p = 0.009).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although the divergence excess type was a statistically significant factor for recurrence in our study (HR = 2.808, CI = 1.007-7.833,</s>
          <s>p-value = 0.049), precaution is needed to interpret this result.</s>
          <s>The percentage of divergence excess type was very low overall (2 cases (3.8%) for Adult group and 9 cases (7%) for Child group), and three of them were classified as recurrence group.</s>
          <s>Considering the marginal significance of p-value and the small number of cases, the relationship between divergence excess type and the recurrence is not clear enough to discuss in the present study.</s>

          <s>However, Bishop and Doran 18 found no difference between the adjustable suture group and the non-adjustable suture group in their study.</s>
          <s>In the present study, the adjustable suture by itself failed to reach statistical significance in terms of affecting the surgical success considering recurrence as failure.</s>

          <s>In spite of various results, these previous study results were not enough to evaluate the effect of age at operation, because these studies mostly included children X(T) patients only.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first comparing the surgical outcomes including survival analysis in Adult and Children X(T) patients.</s>
          <s>Previous studies have tried to find some age point for better surgical outcomes in the range of children, but were unclear.</s>
          <s>In this study, the survival curve was better in the Adult group than Child group.</s>
          <s>There are some possible reasons for this better survival outcome of Adult X(T) patients.</s>
          <s>First, the preoperative angle of Adult group might clearly be more accurate than Child group, because adult patients can cooperate much better than children patients.</s>
          <s>A more accurate preoperative deviation angle will lower the chance of undercorrection and overcorrection.</s>
          <s>Second, the Adult group had better office control than the Child group did preoperatively.</s>
          <s>Good office control might explain why the Adult group could delay the surgery till adulthood, and that also might be associated with good postoperative surgical outcomes, as discussed above <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>
          <s>Third, about 78% of the Adult group were able to undergo adjustable suture, while only 1.6% of the Child group underwent adjustable suture.</s>
          <s>Even though the adjustable suture was not a statistically significant factor in univariate weighted Cox proportional-hazard analysis (HR = 0.39, CI = 0.139-1.092,</s>
          <s>p-value = 0.073), we could guess that there is some marginal association between the adjustable suture and the surgical success rate <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>
          <s>Fourthly, the X(T) itself has a trend toward aggravation, which means the angle of deviation of exotropia becomes larger over time <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34</ref> .</s>
          <s>We matched the Child group to have the same amount of preoperative angle of deviation as the Adult group, however, according to the exodrift nature of X(T), the Child group might have a larger angle of exotropia when they reach the age of the Adult group without surgery.</s>
          <s>As the larger preoperative angle was the significant factor for recurrence in our study, the Child group might have worse prognosis in the future.</s>
          <s>Lastly, even though the pathophysiologic cause of X(T) is not clear, we can presume that the growth itself, including eyeball growth and brain maturation, might influence the course of X(T), and contribute to the variable surgical outcome.</s>
          <s>The more stable status of adults in terms of growth and brain maturation might be the reason for the better surgical outcomes of the Adult group.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Many surgeons prefer some degree of overcorrection after the surgery of X(T) in children patients, because of the high recurrence rate.</s>
          <s>However, our results showed that the Adult group not only had a low recurrence rate, but also had a low threshold to consecutive esotropia.</s>
          <s>Because we performed adjustable suture in over 78% of patients aimed at orthophoria and preventing overcorrection, only three adult patients out of 52 had esotropia larger than 5 PD.</s>
          <s>Two adult patients needed prism glasses because of diplopia even with only 2 PD and 4 PD postoperative esotropia.</s>
          <s>Thus, it is always safer to perform adjustable suture for adult X(T) patients to prevent overcorrection, and there is no need to overcorrect intentionally because of the low recurrence rate.</s>
          <s>Unlike the adult group, the cumulative survival rate of Child group showed an increasing recurrence rate over time.</s>
          <s>Lim et al. reported a cumulative probability of success rate of 22.1% at 5 years for children X(T) with a mean age of eight years 8 .</s>
          <s>Oh and Hwang also reported the cumulative probability of success at five years as about 45% 9 .</s>
          <s>Considering the increasing recurrence rate over time, it is clear that the longer follow up period is better for children X(T) patients.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study has several limitations.</s>
          <s>First, this study is a retrospective case-control design, and even though we carefully selected the control Child group with several statistical considerations, the possibility of selection bias still exists and the results need careful interpretation.</s>
          <s>Second, the use of only a single institution might have limited the power of this study's conclusion.</s>
          <s>However, comparison between the results of the two groups from a single surgeon could also have been a benefit in terms of the same amount of surgical table and identical surgical skills.</s>
          <s>Third, this study did not include sensory test results such as stereopsis and suppression, because many of the Child group were not able to perform the tests due to the cooperation problem.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, this study compared the survival graphs considering recurrence as failure between Adult and Child X(T) groups, and the Adult group showed a better survival curve than the Child group.</s>
          <s>In multivariate weighted cox regression analysis, the younger age at operation and the larger preoperative angle were significant factors for recurrence in the Adult and Child groups.</s>
          <s>The surgical dose-response curves showed no significant differences between the Adult and Child groups.</s>
