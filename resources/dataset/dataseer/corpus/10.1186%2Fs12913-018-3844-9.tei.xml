            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Women with untreated HIV infection are eight times more likely to die during pregnancy or post-partum <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Without antiretroviral therapy, risk of mother-to-child transmission cumulates and reaches 25-45% over the gestation and breastfeeding periods, making early detection and viral suppression critical <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The African region has a maternal syphilis prevalence of 1.7%, translating to 63% of global syphilis infections in pregnancy <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Syphilis is associated with spontaneous miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birthweight, neonatal death, and congenital infection in new-borns <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The duration of exposure in utero is a major determinant of foetal transmission and late treatment in pregnancy may not be effective against congenital disease <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, for sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and syphilis, involvement of male partners is necessary for effective care.</s>
          <s>In malaria endemic regions, 45% of pregnancies would have malaria infection without preventive measures <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Malaria is associated with anaemia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, foetal loss, neonatal and infant mortality <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In Africa, prevalence of anaemia is high: among pregnant women in 2011, an estimated 46% were anaemic and 1.5% were severely anaemic <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Maternal anaemia is associated with fatigue, low-birth weight, and maternal and perinatal death <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is evidence that risks of pre-term birth and low-birth weight are higher if maternal iron deficiency occurred before the second trimester of pregnancy than if it occurred later <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, these conditions are risk factors for one another and they often occur together <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[20]</ref>

            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is therefore essential to address these conditions together as early as possible during pregnancy, ideally with partner involvement, to protect mother and child <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The World Health Organisation has endorsed an integrated disease approach to antenatal care (ANC) that recommends testing for, preventing and treating these four conditions <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite this and the global success in increasing antenatal HIV testing coverage <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[25,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">26]</ref> , rates of testing for the other conditions are still low and few examples of integrated disease approaches to ANC exist at the programme level <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
            <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Kenya's antenatal guidelines, which follow WHO's recommendations, require testing for HIV, syphilis, febrile women for malaria, and anaemia at first ANC visits <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While over 95% of pregnant women attend ANC and over 90% of these women receive HIV testing <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> , less than 50% are tested for syphilis or anaemia <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[32]</ref>
            <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33]</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There are concerns that donor support to HIV programmes may have drawn attention away from non-HIV services <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[36,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>With the new Global Fund call for strengthening health systems through HIV funding, more synergies and integrated programmes can be achieved <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, syphilis screening is one of the most cost-effective antenatal interventions, even in low prevalence settings <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[39,</ref>
            <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While there is currently no national recommendation to screen pregnant women for malaria infection unless a woman has a recent history of fever, screening with microscopy is commonly practiced in facilities with laboratories in malaria endemic regions in Kenya.</s>
          <s>Recently, neighbouring Tanzania has incorporated malaria testing at first visits into their antenatal policy <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is also increasing interest internationally for a strategy that adds malaria testing at first visits to current recommendations of intermittent preventive therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) and bed-net use <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[42]</ref>

          <s>Affordable and reliable point-of-care tests (POCTs) that require minimal training and no durable equipment are available for HIV, syphilis, malaria and anaemia and have been used successfully at the point-of-care <ref target="#b52" type="bibr">[49,</ref>
            <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">50]</ref> .</s>
          <s>They have the potential to improve screening coverage at peripheral facilities and circumvent the need for referrals by shifting antenatal testing from laboratory technicians, who are often based at far centrally-located facilities, to nurses, midwives and lay healthcare workers at peripheral facilities.</s>
          <s>Referrals further delay testing when women already seek ANC late in pregnancy: approximately a third attend clinic in the first trimester, and a third in the third trimester <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">[51]</ref> .</s>
          <s>POCTs have transformed antenatal HIV testing in SSA over the last two decades <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">[52]</ref> , alleviating barriers of stigma, relieving human resource shortages and reducing the need for repeated visits for test results or to reach laboratories <ref target="#b56" type="bibr">[53]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Several studies that have assessed integrating syphilis POCTs with HIV testing for ANC have shown increased job satisfaction among healthcare workers, ease-of-use of tests and increased trust of diagnosis among pregnant women <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">[54]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To examine the integration of syphilis, malaria, and anaemia point-of-care testing with antenatal HIV testing, we conducted an eight-month longitudinal implementation study from December 2014 to August 2015 among seven purposively selected rural facilities (dispensaries) within the study area of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Centers for Disease control (CDC) Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in Siaya County, western Kenya <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[55]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These seven were selected based on geographical spread within the HDSS area, no other ongoing antenatal studies, antenatal care visit volume, and willingness to participate.</s>
          <s>Competency-based training was given to 23 healthcare workers: 14 nurses, two clinical officers, six HIV testing counsellors, and one laboratory technician.</s>
          <s>Training included how to run all four tests per standard operating procedures, safety and appropriate preventive and clinical management of positive results following Kenyan guidelines <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Quality assessments (QA) through observed proficiency testing of healthcare workers performing rapid tests compared to manufacturers' instructions was done immediately after initial training and at three, six and nine months.</s>
          <s>Implementation outcomes of adoption and fidelity, using definitions from a conceptual framework by Proctor et al. <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[56]</ref> , were measured quantitatively.</s>
          <s>In summary, we found that adoption was good as over 95% of pregnant women received all four POCTs at first ANC visit over the study period but treatment fidelity did not reach targets defined by the study.</s>
          <s>Healthcare workers' minimum testing proficiency scores from quality assessments (QA) through performance observations improved from 70 to 91% over the study period, suggesting that most healthcare workers could accurately use integrated POCTs after remedial trainings and practice.</s>
          <s>The intervention's success in improving pregnancy outcomes rests upon healthcare workers' willingness and ability to use four POCTs simultaneously during routine ANC visits, pregnant women's early ANC attendance and their openness to testing and treatment, and partner involvement in the management of sexually transmitted infections.</s>
          <s>Further investigation was therefore needed to understand healthcare workers' and pregnant women's perceptions of the intervention's appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility.</s>
          <s>Appropriateness and acceptability are the perceived relevance and agreeableness of the intervention respectively while feasibility is the extent to which the innovation can be carried out in the implementation environment <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Qualitative approaches were used to assess these implementation constructs: one-on-one semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with healthcare workers were conducted to capture individual experiences of providing integrated testing services and focus group discussions (FGDs) were done with pregnant women to stimulate sharing of experiences with ANC and blood testing services.</s>
          <s>Group discussions allow pregnant women to communicate naturally which can give insight into knowledge, attitudes and social norms as well as generate more critical comments perhaps because the group setting is less intimidating <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[57]</ref> .</s>

          <s>A semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions was used to explore the intervention's appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility (Additional file 1).</s>
          <s>The guide was designed to capture relevance of integrating POCTs to dispensary ANC services, challenges with testing, experience with training and supervision, experience with clients, and barriers to integration and health system constraints beyond healthcare workers' control.</s>
          <s>Healthcare workers who have spent more time with the intervention were generally more verbose than those who were more recently transferred to the intervention facilities.</s>
          <s>The interviews lasted approximately 30-40 min.</s>

        <p>
          <s>We recruited ANC women at the intervention facilities during the first two weeks of August 2015, the last month of the implementation study, to allow healthcare workers enough experience with delivering point-of-care testing services.</s>
          <s id="1" type="Tabular data">Women who had ever attended a first ANC visit at these facilities during the study period were invited (147 women) to participate in the FGDs.</s>
          <s>Twelve FGDs with 118 participating women were conducted at a location away from the facilities on a later date within the same month.</s>
          <s>One or two FGDs were held for each facility depending on the total number of women recruited ( <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The FGDs were conducted by local researchers to mitigate power and cultural differences between researcher and participants: FA led the discussions in the local language (Dholuo) and a trained moderator, also from the study area, took notes.</s>
          <s>Before the start of the discussions, consent forms were read together with the group and written informed consents were obtained from literate women and verbal consents with thumb prints and witness signatures were obtained from illiterate women.</s>
          <s>Women who participated in the FGDs ranged from 15 to 46 years old, one-nine gravida and from three weeks pregnant to recently delivered.</s>
          <s>A discussion guide in Dholuo was used to elicit pregnant women's feelings and opinions of integrated point-of-care testing (POCT) services received (Additional file 2).</s>
          <s>The following domains were covered: knowledge of conditions, experience of ANC testing services and treatments received, relationships with healthcare workers, and experience of talking to partners.</s>
          <s>The topic guide was translated and back-translated from English to Dholuo and piloted before use to ensure consistent meaning across the languages.</s>
          <s>The level of interaction in the focus groups was generally well engaged and relaxed.</s>
          <s>However, there were quieter groups where the moderator had to stimulate more discussion among respondents using open-ended probes.</s>

          <s>The study provides insight on the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility as well as potential explanations of high adoption and low fidelity of the integrated testing programme among end-users.</s>
          <s>Healthcare workers and pregnant women found point-of-care testing to be an important and necessary intervention for antenatal care.</s>
          <s>Recommendations for scale-up efforts include the need to address vertical programming structures by engaging donors and programme managers to encourage horizontal thinking of disease management and to create synergies across programmes.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Human resource challenges will need to be addressed to improve healthcare worker conditions and commodity supply chains strengthened to ensure no stock-outs.</s>
          <s>Community engagement to encourage early ANC attendance is needed for early detection and treatment of conditions.</s>
          <s>Strategies to involve male partners and decrease stigma of HIV would help create openness and acceptability to care and treatment as well as safeguard pregnant women against gender violence.</s>
          <s>This will require a holistic effort from the community, county, national and international leaders.</s>
