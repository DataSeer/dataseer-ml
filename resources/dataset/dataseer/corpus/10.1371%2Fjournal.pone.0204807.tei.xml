          <s>Cortisol is a steroid hormone, or more specifically, a glucocorticoid that is secreted by the adrenal glands.</s>
          <s>Cortisol affects many bodily systems and plays an important role in bone growth, arterial pressure regulation, immune and nervous system functions, fat, carbohydrate and protein metabolism and, more specifically, in the response to stress <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, psychological stress has significant repercussions for physical and psychological health <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In some situations, stress can be beneficial.</s>
          <s>In fact, stress provides an impulse that gives an individual the energy to help others, to skilfully face situations such as passing an exam or getting a job, or to even for arriving on time for a meeting.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, extreme and prolonged stress severely impacts health and, as aforementioned, can affect the immune, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , as well as triggering mental disorders <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Two mechanisms activate the stress response: the sympathetic adrenomedullary system, which secretes catecholamines to induce a rapid response of the cardiovascular system; and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</s>
          <s>The HPA axis is activated through the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus, which stimulates the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).</s>
          <s>The ACTH is then transported in the blood to the adrenal cortex, which triggers the secretion of glucocorticoids <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One of the most studied glucocorticoids involved in the stress response is cortisol.</s>
          <s>Currently, the best method of biologically evaluating the response to stress is by measuring HPA-axis activity using cortisol levels.</s>
          <s>Traditionally, the level of cortisol in saliva has been the most commonly used indicator for measuring cortisol.</s>
          <s>This method has many advantages: it is non-invasive, therefore, it is less stressful; it is inexpensive; and the data can be collected by non-medical staff in a wide variety of settings.</s>
          <s>Unfortunately, measuring cortisol levels in saliva, blood (invasive) and urine is only useful for specific, limited periods of time and cannot detect stress longitudinally or retrospectively <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, these measures are easily influenced by individual and environmental characteristics, such as study procedures <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> , the time of day <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , and food consumption <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Due to these limitations, researchers have been seeking alternatives that allow for a noninvasive and retrospective assessment of cortisol.</s>
          <s>In recent years, a new method has been developed for measuring cortisol in humans and animals by extracting cortisol from hair.</s>
          <s>For years, hair has been used as a substrate for measuring environmental agents, drugs or toxins and even for retrospectively measuring steroid hormones <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref type="bibr">10]</ref> , including Hair Cortisol Concentrations (HCC), which were tested for the first time in 2000 <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Since then, many studies have begun using this promising method for measuring chronic stress, because, among its numerous advantages, it provides researchers with a window into the recent past of the individual.</s>
          <s>Hair has a fairly consistent growth rate of approximately 1 cm per month.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the 1 cm segment closest to the scalp approximates one month of the production of cortisol.</s>
          <s>The second closest centimetre approximates the previous month's production, and so on <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Hence, by collecting a 3 cm segment of hair, researchers can obtain the accumulated cortisol in hair as an indicator of HPA activation during the three previous months.</s>
          <s>Researchers are able to retrospectively examine cortisol production during the time period when a stressor was most salient, without needing to take a sample right at that particular time.</s>
          <s>Moreover, contrary to the method of collecting blood samples, hair sampling is non-invasive and painless.</s>
          <s>Consequently, there is no risk that the collection itself will stimulate cortisol production.</s>
          <s>If there would be any particular case of the stimulation of cortisol production caused by the sampling collection, it would have no impact due to delayed cortisol production and scalp-cutting distance.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, as each centimetre approximates one month's production of cortisol, intra-and inter-day fluctuations settle.</s>
          <s>Finally, the ease of use of HCC analysis and the fact that collection does not require trained medical staff are remarkable drivers.</s>
          <s>Once collected, hair samples can be stored at room temperature, in envelopes or vials, which facilitates its transportation <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To date, many studies have applied this method as a biomarker for chronic stress.</s>
          <s>Since the development and validation of the technique in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , hair cortisol research has rapidly increased.</s>
          <s>In the literature, there are observational or interventional studies <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[15,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">16]</ref> that use it as a biomarker for stressful life events <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> ; studies on stress in animals <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">17]</ref> , studies on emotional states and anxiety disorders and other psychopathological disorders <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">19]</ref> , and studies on its relation to other sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , and others.</s>
          <s>Accordingly, in the last decade, the method of extracting cortisol from hair has become a promising biomarker for chronic stress and HPA alterations, such as Cushing's syndrome <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[21]</ref> and Addison's disease <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, HCC analysis is also a suitable method for known conditions that increase cortisol secretion, which are neither a mental disorder nor a physical/somatic illness, as with pregnancy or endurance athletes <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In particular, during pregnancy there is an increase of cortisol production of up to threefold, although the amount of the increase is not clear.</s>
          <s>This increase appears to be driven by circulating levels of corticotropin releasing hormone of placental origin, which is thought to regulate a placental clock that controls a series of physiological events, including myometrial activation, leading to delivery <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In pregnancy, hair cortisol has shown promising results with the finding of relationship with postpartum depression symptoms <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, relations between newborn hair cortisol and preterm birth and birth weight have been found <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The most recent studies have shown how this method facilitates long-term retrospective data-collection on stress, by non-invasive means, which further emphasises its great potential for use in research.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To clarify the effect of possible confounders is relevant for the validity of the HCC methodology.</s>
          <s>Studies on some of the confounders of HCC are reviewed by Wosu <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[27]</ref> who finds, for example, a complex relationship between age and HCC levels, which seems to be nonlinear.</s>
          <s>Hence, such a finding highlights the need to develop more studies with a broader age range.</s>
          <s>In relation to sex, research results are also inconsistent.</s>
          <s>Research undertaken on lifestyle variables shows no effect of smoking, use of medication, or oral contraceptives, and inconsistent relations with body mass index (BMI), while vigorous physical activity and alcohol intake were positively correlated with HCC.</s>
          <s>Research on confounders is still in its early stages, and most of studies use of purposive sampling (e.g., caregivers of persons with chronic disease, war veterans, etc.).</s>
          <s>Therefore, the evidence on the role of possible confounders and the validity of HCC is still scant.</s>

        <head>Discussion</head>
        <p>
          <s>In recent years, the measurement of HCC has been on the rise, because of its significance in evaluating chronic stress and other associated disorders, such as depression or post-traumatic stress.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, HCC is useful for evaluating disorders that entail inadequate HPA response, such as Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, or various autoimmune diseases.</s>
          <s>As this method becomes increasingly more prevalent, a deeper understanding about its relationship with other confounder variables is needed, as well as, information about HCC in different groups and populations.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the objective of this research was to study HCC in a sample of healthy Spaniards, to research on possible confounders of HCC, as well as to study HCC in a sample of pregnant woman.</s>
          <s>Results have shown a significant relation between HCC and age, education, employment status, physical exercise, and use of hair dyes and contraceptives.</s>
          <s>However, in the adjusted model, only education and physical exercised remained as predictors.</s>
          <s>Pregnant women showed higher levels of HCC than non-pregnant women during the three trimesters of pregnancy, and their HCC was related to education level in the first trimester.</s>
          <s>The effect of age has been studied in several studies, finding different relations with varying hair cortisol levels.</s>
          <s>According to the meta-analysis of Stalder <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , age was found to be positively related to HCC, although only in a correlation-based analysis.</s>
          <s>In this line, Staufenbiel <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[18]</ref> finds a positive lineal relation between age and cortisol in a sample of 760 participants (16 to 65 years of age), while Dettenborn <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[35]</ref> finds a quadratic relation with a U-shaped relation, in a sample of 360 participants with ages from 1 to 91 years.</s>
          <s>In our sample, results show a negative linear relation with lower HCC in older ages.</s>
          <s>An explanation for this discrepancy may be the sample characteristics, while our sample is constituted by healthy adults, other studies do not exclude illness, although they do analyse the effect of some illness on HCC.</s>
          <s>Staufenbiel <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[18]</ref> finds higher HCC in participants with diabetes mellitus, the incidence of which increases with age.</s>
          <s>Therefore, our results may show a decrease in HCC with age, due to the removal of some illness effect.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In relation to the sex of the participants, our results show no statistical differences between women and men.</s>
          <s>In accordance with this, previous investigations reveal no sex differences in hair cortisol levels <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[36,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">37]</ref> , while other researchers suggest lower HCC in women than in men <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[35,</ref>

          <s>Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the relation of HCC with confounders, such as age and sex.</s>
          <s>With respect to other sociodemographic variables, our results show no statistical differences in civil status, dependent children, and the use of drugs.</s>
          <s>These results are similar to those found by Dettenborn <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[35]</ref> , Staufenbiel <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[36]</ref> , and Feller <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[38]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Related to education, our results show higher levels of HCC in participants with a university level of education than, participants with a primary level of education or less.</s>
          <s>Previous research found no effect of education on HCC <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[36,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, Boesch <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[40]</ref> finds a negative relation between HCC and education in young men who were occupied with military training.</s>
          <s>In this line, retired participants showed lower levels of HCC than employed, unemployed and student participants.</s>
          <s>There are no previous works, to our knowledge, that study employment status in a wide age range, therefore, there are no studies considering these four categories (employed, unemployed, students and retired) and their relation with HCC.</s>
          <s>Only Feller <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[38]</ref> finds higher HCC, related to retired and unemployed status in older adults, although this effect disappeared when adjusting for further confounders.</s>
          <s>Considering retired status to be more prevalent in older ages, our results also show lower levels of HCC in older ages.</s>
          <s>Although the effects of these variables disappear when adjusting for further confounders, our sample constitutes a healthy sample, and this fact may explain the discrepancies within the results of other works, due to the removal of some illness effect.</s>

          <s>In the review by Wosu <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[27]</ref> , vigorous physical exercise seems to be related to higher HCC levels, and similar results are disclosed by Gerber <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[41]</ref> in comparing moderate vs. vigorous physical exercise in university students.</s>
          <s>In our study, "regular physical exercise" reported by participants was positively correlated with HCC levels.</s>
          <s>Considering the wide age range of our study, this may be attributable to the different impacts of physical activity, depending on the age of the individual.</s>

          <s>According to <ref type="bibr">Burke [42]</ref> , combined oral contraceptives increase cortisol production, but this depends on the dose of oestrogen and, when considering the complex effect of estrogen on the hepatic metabolism of steroids, it is not surprising that results showing that HCC can be dependent on oral contraceptives use are mixed.</s>
          <s>The use of hair dyes and their effect on HCC also has mixed results.</s>

          <s>In relation to employment status, Braig <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[46]</ref> finds higher levels of HCC in multiple jobholding individuals, but not in the unemployed or in women with only one form of employment.</s>
          <s>Although we do not consider the variable of multiple jobholding, in this line our results also suggest no differences between employed and unemployed women, as suggested by our results in relation to employment and unemployment.</s>

            <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">47]</ref> also show no effect of age on HCC.</s>

          <s>Some limitations of the present study are noted here.</s>
          <s>First, young participants with a high educational level are over-represented.</s>
          <s>Consideration of having any illness as an exclusion criteria, permitted us to exclude the confounder effect of many health problems, but also to reduce the number of possible participants in older ages.</s>
          <s>Moreover, while there are controversial results related to the gender of the sample and its relation with HCC, to our knowledge, there are no investigations setting differences in HCC across different levels of education or employment status by using a sample with a wide range of ages.</s>
          <s>In relation to education, only Boesch <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[40]</ref> finds significant differences in HCC in a sample of young males undertaking military training, however, the characteristics of this sample do not permit comparisons with our results.</s>
          <s>Another limitation of our research has been the non-inclusion of other variables which may have an effect in HCC, for example, smoking, body mass index, hair washing frequency or heat treatments.</s>
          <s>Research using these variables shows inconclusive results <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[23,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">27]</ref> , hence, it would be necessary for further research in assessing the relation between these variables and HCC.</s>
          <s>We include BMI in the sample of pregnant women, but not in the general sample, however, many recent studies have shown higher levels of HCC in obese participants, which may constitute a potential bias to HCC means in our results.</s>
          <s>On the other hand, in relation to selfreported measures of stress, we do not include any assessment of perceived stress or life events due to the fact that previous research has shown no relation between HCC and self-reported measures of stress, both in the general population and in pregnant women <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although a relation between HCC and ongoing chronic stress has been found <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , we do not control for this variable, which may also constitute a potential bias to HCC means in our results.</s>
          <s>Related to the method of extraction, different methods or different ELISA kits show different results <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[22]</ref> , which may limit any comparison between studies.</s>
          <s>However, a recent study investigating the inter-laboratory consistency in determining HCC using different methods, has found a high correlation between methods and laboratories when analysing a common batch of hair <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[48]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Considering hair cortisol as an important factor that is associated with endocrine functioning, as well as with a health risk for the general population, and specially during pregnancy, such a biomarker would also potentially help facilitate the earlier detection of individuals who are most at risk for deleterious health outcomes, and help to develop preventive methods to mitigate stress.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Research using the HCC methodology is still in its early stages.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the body of evidence is still little or non-existent and also it is inconclusive.</s>
          <s>In our sample of healthy Spaniards, HCC decreases with age.</s>
          <s>We also find an interaction with educational level, employment status, use of contraceptives, use of hair dyes, and physical exercise.</s>
          <s>In our sample of pregnant women, we find higher levels of HCC than in non-pregnant women during the three trimesters of pregnancy.</s>
          <s>Only during the first trimester did we find a relation with education level.</s>
          <s>This study emphasises the need to determine the relationship between HCC and confounders such as sociodemographic and lifestyle variables in the general population and specific groups formed by individuals such as pregnant women.</s>
          <s>HCC has the potential of becoming a valuable tool in diagnosing and controlling the progression of HPA diseases and conditions which have an effect on HPA functioning.</s>
          <s>Further research is needed to clarify the value of HPA in clinical practice and research, and also in order to improve the methodology, its application and the interpretation the research results.</s>
