          <p>
            <s>in fruit and vegetables.</s>
            <s>In this study, we applied metal nanoparticles to fruit and vegetables samples to improve the ability of LIBs to detect trace pesticide and heavy metal residues in the samples.</s>
            <s>the nanoparticle-enhanced LIBs technique gave pesticide residue detection limits for fruit and vegetables two orders of magnitude lower than achieved using standard LIBs and heavy metal detection limits markedly better than achieved using standard LIBs.</s>
            <s>We used the nanoparticle-enhanced LIBs technique to study the distributions of harmful chemicals in vegetable leaves.</s>
            <s>We found that heavy metals are distributed unevenly in edible plant leaves, the heavy metal concentrations being higher in the veins than in the mesophyll.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Extensive pesticide and fertilizer application can lead to residues of harmful chemicals such as pesticides and heavy metals being found in fruit and vegetables.</s>
            <s>These residues may pose risks to human health 1-3 .</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Measurements of harmful chemical concentrations in fruit and vegetables usually require samples to be collected and processed in the laboratory.</s>
            <s>Traditional methods for detecting pesticide residues include liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 4-6 , high performance liquid chromatography 7 , fluorescence polarization immunoassay 8,9 , and multi-enzyme inhibition assay 10 .</s>
            <s>However, these methods are complicated and time consuming.</s>
            <s>Heavy metals are currently determined using methods such as synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence 11,12 , scanning or transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis 13,14 , proton/ particle induced X-ray emission spectroscopy 15-19 , secondary ionization mass spectrometry 20-22 , laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 23,24 .</s>
            <s>and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry 25,26 .</s>
            <s>These methods have been used widely but have drawbacks such as being slow or non-portable.</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            <s>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been used to determine pesticide and heavy metal residues because samples can be analysed in situ (i.e., samples do not need to be taken to a laboratory), because it is fast, and because inline analyses can be performed <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>
              <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>
              <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
            <s>Members of our research team have used LIBS to determine pesticide residues in fruit 30 .</s>
            <s>The results of that study indicated that LIBS can be used to determine harmful chemicals in fruit but with relatively high limits of detection (LoDs) inappropriate for quantitatively determining trace chemicals.</s>
            <s>Much effort has been put into improving the capabilities of LIBS in recent years, and this is the focus of our work.</s>
            <s>Some researchers have used multi-pulse 31,32 , magnetic confinement 33,34 , space constraints 34,35 , inert gases 35 , and other techniques to improve LIBS signals and the sensitivity of LIBS method.</s>
            <s>These methods require the LIBS system to be modified and are not suitable for determining harmful chemicals on the surfaces of fruit and vegetables.</s>
            <s>LIBS signals have also been enhanced using coinage metal nanoparticles 36 , a method called nanoparticle-enhanced (NE) LIBS.</s>
            <s>NELIBS is a promising technique with a wide range of applications 37 .</s>
            <s>Because of the excellent signal enhancement performance, it can flexibly be used to measure objects with high sensitivity.</s>

          <s>It is possible to indirectly measure chlorpyrifos by measuring these elements.</s>
          <s>S is commonly found in fruit and vegetables, so it is best to measure P and Cl to allow the chlorpyrifos concentration to be determined.</s>
          <s>The LIBS spectrum of P has spectral features at 213.62, 214.91, 253.56, and 255.33 nm <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">27,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
          <s>The LIBS spectrum of Cl has a characteristic peak at 837.59 nm <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The LIBS spectra before and after 80 nm silver nanoparticles had been added to apples and chives containing chlorpyrifos at a concentration of 240 mg/L are shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> .</s>
          <s>The LIBS characteristic peaks for P for apple containing chlorpyrifos are shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The characteristic peaks were quite weak, and even the characteristic peak at 255.33 nm was barely visible.</s>
          <s>However, as shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref> , the NELIBS characteristic peaks (i.e., for the apple samples coated with 80 nm silver nanoparticles) for P at 213.62, 214.91, and 253.56 nm were about four times more intense than the LIBS peaks.</s>
          <s>The characteristic peak at 255.33 nm, which was not visible using LIBS, was clearly visible using NELIBS.</s>
          <s>These results indicated that adding 80 nm silver nanoparticles markedly enhanced the LIBS signal for P on the apple surface.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We proved that the P that was detected was added as chlorpyrifos by analysing apple samples that had not been sprayed with chlorpyrifos by LIBS and NELIBS.</s>
          <s>No P peaks at 213.62, 214.91, and 253.56 nm were observed before or after 80 nm silver nanoparticles had been added.</s>
          <s>The same procedure was used to analyse the chive samples by LIBS and NELIBS.</s>
          <s>As can be seen from <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(c,d)</ref> , applying silver nanoparticles to the chive surfaces clearly enhanced the LIBS signal for P.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The NELIBS signals were more intense than the LIBS signals for chlorpyrifos residues on both the apple and chive samples, but the signals were enhanced less for the chive samples than for the apple samples.</s>
          <s>This may have been because chive leaf surfaces are not as hard and smooth as apple epidermis.</s>
          <s>Irradiating a sample with the laser will cause the silver nanoparticles to produce heat, which will be more easily absorbed by the moisture in a chive leaf than by the moisture in an apple epidermis.</s>
          <s>The absorption of the heat by a chive leaf will limit the effect of the silver nanoparticles.</s>
          <s>These results indicate that the surface properties of a substrate will affect the enhancement effect offered by silver nanoparticles.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The LIBS signals for P in chlorpyrifos on the chive leaves were almost twice as strong as the signals for P in chlorpyrifos on the apple surfaces whether silver nanoparticles were applied or not.</s>
          <s>This was also the case for the LIBS signals for Cl.</s>
          <s>The characteristic Cl peaks were not observed in the LIBS spectra for the apple samples treated with chlorpyrifos either before or after silver nanoparticles were applied.</s>
          <s>However, in the LIBS spectra for the chives coated with silver nanoparticles, the characteristic Cl peak at 837.59 nm was observed, which as shown in <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> .</s>
          <s>This indicated that chlorpyrifos was more easily detected by LIBS on chive leaves than on apple epidermis, possibly because access of the laser to elements in the pesticide was restricted less on chive leaves than on apple epidermis.</s>
          <s>Elements other than P and Cl in chive leaves are also more easily to undergo energy level transitions, e.g., the characteristic peaks of Al at 212.38 nm (shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> (c)) and of Mn at 251.56, 252.45, and 252.87 nm (shown in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(d)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>It can be seen from <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> (d) that the characteristic Mn peak was more intense for clean chives coated with silver nanoparticles than for chives coated with chlorpyrifos and silver nanoparticles.</s>
          <s>This peak was even more intense than the characteristic P peak.</s>
          <s>We speculate that this was because chlorpyrifos was deposited on and covered the chive leaf surfaces.</s>
          <s>Performing LIBS, the laser will only stimulate chlorpyrifos molecules on the surfaces but not the material (i.e., tissues) beneath.</s>
          <s>Mn was therefore excited easily and gave a strong characteristic peak in the absence of chlorpyrifos but was excited less and gave a weaker peak when chlorpyrifos was present.</s>
          <s>This phenomenon was not found for the apple samples.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>We also studied the determination of heavy metal residues in fruit and vegetables by NELIBS using Cd as an example.</s>
          <s>The LIBS spectra of lettuce leaves grown under stress in a solution containing Cd(NO 3 ) 2 at a concentration of 400 μmol/L are shown in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> .</s>
          <s>We focused on the Cd atomic lines at 214.4, 226.5, and 228.8 nm.</s>
          <s>It can be seen from <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> that the LIBS spectrum for the lettuce leaves had very weak characteristic Cd peaks but that adding 80 nm silver nanoparticles caused clear characteristic Cd peaks to be present.</s>
          <s>This indicated that silver nanoparticles can effectively increase the intensities of heavy metal LIBS signals in lettuces.</s>
          <s>Some other peaks that probably from air or other elements in the leaves were also enhanced, but they were not what we were interested in, nor will they be discussed here.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The results described above indicated that the nanoparticles markedly enhanced the LIBS spectra.</s>
          <s>This effect can be interpreted in two ways.</s>
          <s>First, the nanoparticles may increase the number density of particles of the sample in the ablation process <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">39</ref> .</s>
          <s>Second, the nanoparticles may decrease the ablation threshold <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">40</ref> .</s>
          <s>NELIBS can allow trace chemicals in fruit and vegetables to be detected at concentrations that cannot be detected using the ordinary LIBS method.</s>
          <s>NELIBS can easily be used to determine whether the concentrations of harmful chemicals in fruit and vegetables exceed legal limits and is a new way of monitoring the qualities of fruit and vegetables.</s>

          <s>Quantitative analysis and an assessment of the detection limit.</s>
          <s>The results described above indicated that NELIBS can be used to qualitatively detect harmful chemicals in fruit and vegetables.</s>

          <s>The curves fitted to the intensities of the four peaks at the different chlorpyrifos concentrations are shown in <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> .</s>
          <s>A good positive linear relationship was found between the intensity of each peak and the chlorpyrifos concentration.</s>
          <s>It can be seen from the error bars in <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> that the standard deviations of the 255.33 nm peak intensities were relatively large.</s>

          <s>The effect of this could be eliminated by taking the mean of repeated measurements.</s>
          <s>For comprehensive comparison, the best quantitative measurements could be made using the 214.91 nm peak, the intensity of which was relatively stable and correlated best with the chlorpyrifos concentration.</s>
