            <s>Knee replacement is a common preference sensitive quality-of-life procedure that can reduce pain and improve function for people with advanced knee arthritis.</s>
            <s>While most patients improve, knee replacement surgery has the potential for serious complications.</s>
            <s>Prosthetic knee infection is an uncommon but serious complication.</s>
            <s>This study explored the impact of cases of prosthetic knee infection on surgeons' personal and professional wellbeing.</s>
            <s>Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with consultant orthopaedic surgeons who treated patients for prosthetic knee infection in one of six high-volume NHS orthopaedic departments.</s>
            <s>Data was audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically.</s>

            <s>The occurrence of prosthetic joint infection has a significant emotional impact on surgeons who report a collective sense of devastation and personal ownership, even though prosthetic joint infection cannot be fully controlled for.</s>
            <s>Surgeons stressed the importance of openly discussing the management of prosthetic joint infection with a supportive multidisciplinary team and this has implications for the ways in which orthopaedic surgeons may be best supported to manage this complication.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Knee replacement surgery is a discretionary, preference sensitive surgery that can improve quality of life for people with advanced knee arthritis.</s>
          <s>It has the potential to improve patients' quality of life by reducing pain and improving function, but there is also potential for serious complications.</s>
          <s>Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with severe pain, functional difficulties and poor quality of life <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>If left untreated, PJI may result in limb amputation or death <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When PJI is identified, further major operations are often required to clear the infection, which reduces the need for subsequent joint removal or even limb amputation.</s>
          <s>Surgical treatment can be prolonged sometimes involving multiple a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 surgeries and hospitalisations and prolonged antibiotic treatment.</s>
          <s>PJI and its treatment has a profoundly negative impact on all aspects of patients' lives, including physical, social, emotional and economic aspects and patients undergoing treatment can experience feelings of isolation and insecurity, and an inability to live independently <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Cahill and colleagues found that the profoundly negative impact on patients' social functioning and mental health is notable with this group of patients rating their overall quality of life as poor with 12% of patients rating their current situation as equivalent to or worse than death <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Infection rates have been reduced by addressing contributory health system and surgical factors <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recent evidence synthesis has shown that multiple patient related factors are associated with developing post-operative infection <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, despite the small risk of adverse events such as infection, patients still have the capacity to benefit greatly from arthroplasty.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although recent research has concentrated on the impact of infection on patients <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> , little is known about how surgeons may be affected when patients whom they have treated have infection.</s>
          <s>Adverse events may have considerable impact on healthcare professionals, particularly if the professionals are seen to be accountable for the outcome <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>For surgeons, adverse events and surgical complications are a major source of unpleasant emotions, cognitive dysfunction and negative feelings <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A growing body of evidence describes how adverse events and medical errors have a negative emotional impact on surgeons and other healthcare professionals <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Many surgeons uphold a "surgical ideal", whereby surgery is seen as the only chance to cure a patient or improve their quality of life.</s>
          <s>When surgery does not achieve this goal surgeons report feelings of failure which may impact on their coping response to intraoperative complications <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Surgeons across all specialties are largely unprepared for the intense emotional responses that adverse events can elicit, which may not only affect clinical judgement, but also impact on surgeons' personal and professional identity <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These emotional responses to adverse events can be associated with increased feelings of personal responsibility, guilt, selfdoubt, anxiety and distress <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> , but are dependent on factors including surgical experience, colleagues' reactions and the preventability of complications <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is an element of uncertainty in surgery where clear scientific evidence is lacking <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While adverse events can impact decision-making by affecting judgement or changing practice <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , the "second victim" <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> of medical mistakes or adverse occurrence-surgeons-can feel unique, vulnerable and isolated in their reactions to such events <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This "oppressive experience" <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> may help to explain surgeons' tendency to become more conservative and more risk-averse following adverse events <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there is little literature that focuses on the impact on surgeons, where there is no obvious cause to adverse events such as prosthetic joint infection (PJI).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Approximately 1% of patients who undergo knee replacement develop PJI <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2015, just over 6,000 knee revision procedures were performed in the UK, of which nearly one quarter (1,420 (23%)) were for infection <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although PJI has been described as "an orthopaedic surgeon's worst nightmare" <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> , relatively little is known about how PJI impacts surgeons professionally and personally.</s>
          <s>Identification and acknowledgement of the emotional impact of PJI may help in the development of support strategies and maintaining surgeons' well-being <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , and a deeper understanding of the personal and professional impact of adverse events is needed <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Understanding how surgeons react to the occurrence of PJI is an important clinical question and has wider relevance to establishing how surgical teams can be supported during the management of this complication.</s>

          <s>Qualitative methods are well established.</s>

          <s>This included analysing preoperative and intraoperative processes such as sterilisation and surgical wound closure.</s>
          <s>Despite careful inspection and planning, participants perceived PJI as an inevitability, suggesting that "despite every measure" it "happens to every surgeon" at some point in their career.</s>
          <s>One surgeon suggested that late, haematogenous PJI is unavoidable in patients with infections which migrate to the joint, whereas early post-operative PJI should be preventable.</s>
          <s>Another suggested that his feeling of devastation in response to a patient's diagnosis of PJI was in part due to his lack of knowledge regarding the source of the patient's infection.</s>
          <s>Surgeons felt strongly however, that adverse events were a consequence of their profession, and PJI an inevitable outcome at some point in every surgeons' career when performing high numbers of joint replacement operations, and providing all appropriate measures are taken, they do not need to accept fault when it does occur.</s>
          <s>Surgeons appeared to expect a diagnosis of PJI at some point in their career, yet still its occurrence made them question their practice despite taking 'every measure' and left them feeling that they had let the patient down.</s>
          <s>This sense of accountability is also reinforced by the recording of individual surgeons' clinical performance outcomes, which are scrutinised by the National Joint Registry, the hospital, their colleagues and the public, which left surgeons with a sense of 'skewed' accountability, despite the fact that PJI is rarely attributable to a failing of the surgeon.</s>
          <s>Surgeons expressed the importance of being empathic and honest with their patients following a diagnosis of PJI and discussed their own need to engage in careful reflection on their practice, questioning their performance and re-examining all surgical processes.</s>
          <s>Participants suggested that the need to persevere and continue to perform surgery after a diagnosis of PJI was vital to ensuring they maintained their confidence.</s>

          <s>Although the number of cases of PJI a surgeon may experience is relatively small in comparison to the number of operations they perform, the consequences of PJI are devastating for both patients and surgeons.</s>

          <s>beyond dying", "a catastrophe, absolute disaster".</s>
          <s>The consequences for patients are of such significance that surgeons were able to recall patients diagnosed with PJI, years after they had been treated, stating how they "remember every one", "by name, x-ray appearance and quite often organism".</s>
          <s>One surgeon described avoiding infection as his "biggest paranoia".</s>
          <s>Participants discussed the pride they took in "doing a good job".</s>
          <s>Another surgeon described how he could not help feeling that a patient with PJI had "come to harm" as a consequence of undergoing knee replacement, i.e. it would not have occurred if the joint had not been replaced.</s>
          <s>This suggests that surgeons feel some level of personal responsibility despite being unable to completely control for the occurrence of PJI.</s>
          <s>They were keenly aware of the consequences for patients and as such PJI was "devastating" and "deeply unpleasant" when it occurred.</s>
          <s>Two surgeons mentioned that such occurrences were "soul-destroying" and could "eat[s] you up and just destroy[s] you" unless they proved their resilience by maintaining their practice.</s>
          <s>This suggests that the occurrence of PJI has a significant emotional impact on surgeons, who feel responsible for patients' well-being and above all pride themselves in doing their job well, to relieve patients of pain and improve their quality of life, and yet the occurrence of PJI could significantly worsen a patient's quality of life.</s>

          <s>When PJI does occur, surgeons highlighted the importance of acknowledging the diagnosis and being honest with patients.</s>
          <s>Surgeons have a high degree of professional autonomy and our findings suggest that in some departments decisions about treatment may be made individually and not always discussed with colleagues: one surgeon suggested that there was a temptation to "bury your head in the sand because you don't want to accept that there's a problem with something you've done" but suggested he was lucky enough to work in a department with national leaders who specialised in PJI, and so felt supported.</s>
          <s>This may not always be the case for other surgeons.</s>
          <s>Another suggested that occurrence of PJI could potentially be "isolating" for a surgeon where such support did not exist.</s>

        <p>
          <s>All participants in this study reported having expert colleagues, who provided help and professional support.</s>
          <s>Surgeons reported that asking colleagues for advice and assistance and coming together as part of a strong and supportive team made dealing with a patient with PJI "easier", and every participating surgeon described a need for and experience of being supported by colleagues, predominantly through regular, open discussions of surgical complications, within a multidisciplinary team.</s>

It's not really a surgeon's fault but I don't think any people should be getting early post- operative infection and that is a failure of er, the system somewhere. (Surgeon 4) I guess what you have to reassure yourself is there are so many other factors that can occur not only just you know, you and the operation, it's just the whole process of sterilisation, disinfection, the patient factors, there are so many things that have problems, but you know, personally speaking . . .But at the same time, if a recurrent problem is happening then you need to step back and reflect and work out what's going on. (Surgeon 2) I'm honest with my patients, you know, when they come to me with infections from elsewhere to say that every surgeon gets infections. I do it myself and I'm brutally honest with them about my er, rates personally for my clearance rates when I do infection work, and at the likelihood of recurrence in the long run. (Surgeon 3) It's pretty devastating because you never really know why it happened, I mean fortunately, well touch wood, I haven't had any primary joint replacements yet which have got infected, and I've done about 250 or so now, but I'm sure it will happen, you know, there's no escaping it but there are so many. (Surgeon 2) It does, it knocks you for six, and you then start to look at practice again. You go back to the literature and you listen to things in meetings. Should I be doing this? Does it make a difference? You then start to look at things like skin prep; anything from that to what you're closing the wound with. So, the whole process you re- examine again, not necessarily changing but just having your eyes open as to where the contamination is coming from. Is it me? Is it the pre-operative process? Have we missed something? (Surgeon 6) From a very selfish point of view it skew-erm, it will affect your figures on the registry. (Surgeon 10) We get appraised once a year and our infection rates are examined, in terms of locally, and our revision rates in terms of the NJR are looked at.

but surgeons still feel accountable. 

I think the first time it happens, it's very hard to deal with as a 
surgeon, but actually, we do a job that involves risks and involves 
complications associated with the surgery, and as long as you are 
comfortable with yourself that you have taken every measure you 
can to minimise those risks at the time of their initial surgery, you 
need to accept that, it's not your fault. Actually, there are a certain 
proportion of patients, that despite every measure being taken, 
does develop an infection and it doesn't just happen to you; it 
happens to every surgeon that does that surgery, and all you can 
do in that situation is be empathic with your patient, do 
everything that you possibly can, to treat them in the way you 
would wish to be treated yourself and do what you can to try to 
clear it. (Surgeon 1) 
It's, it's not good news. And as I said, it's extremely rare and my 
experience I have never, ever had an infection in a primary joint 
as an early infection. And this is in eight, eight years. What I have 
had is people having late haematogenous infection maybe two or 
three, </table>

(Surgeon 2) It's a bit soul-destroying really. You know, you do operations to try and make people better and you accept there are consequences that, you know, if you do enough operations then you will get complications, but it doesn't mean that it's not, erm, a deeply unpleasant thing.

infections. So, they don't happen very often, but you'll probably remember every 
one. (Surgeon 11) 
Oh, it's awful. It's one of the worst things that can happen. [Really?] Beyond dying, 
yeah. No, it's a catastrophe, absolute disaster. Awful, like you remember them by 
name. . . By-name, x-ray appearance and quite often organism as well. (Surgeon 5) 
It's devastating. . .we pride ourselves in doing a good job and I think if you have one 
infection you can-I can virtually count them or remember their names in the last 
few years. (Surgeon 6) 
So a patient of mine gets a deep prosthetic joint infection, okay, well it's happened 
once in nine years and that is horrible, really horrible you feel, er, you feel 
personally responsible. (Surgeon 8) 
On a personal level it's horrible because you've harmed someone, well not 
necessarily you've harmed someone, but someone's come to harm from something 
you've done. Erm, it's obviously bad for the patient. It's-it's an unpleasant thing to 
have and they can have quite protracted treatment. (Surgeon 10) 
It's devastating. Erm, you know, the er-my biggest paranoia is, is avoiding 
infection. (Surgeon 3) 
As a Surgeon, . . . who's had complications, because we all do, you know, it's pretty 
devastating you know, when something goes wrong, but you literally just have to get 
back on Prosthetic joint infection and impact on orthopaedic surgeons
