        <p>
          <s>The study was a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted from May to June 2017 among healthcare providers working in public health institutions (PHI) within the jurisdiction of Hawassa, 275km south of the capital (Addis Ababa) of Ethiopia.</s>
          <s>The public health institutions consist of nine healthcentres and two hospitals of which one was a secondary level public hospital and the other a tertiary level comprehensive specialized hospital.</s>
          <s>Under the public health centres are seventeen health posts where the health extension workers are working.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>During the study period, healthcare workers consisted of 106 doctors, 826 nurses, 60 health officers, 95 midwifes, and 142 health extension workers who were employed in the institutions and formed the target population for the study.</s>
          <s>The health extension workers are primarily nurses, specifically trained to provide community health service in line with the country's primary healthcare package.</s>
          <s>The maternal healthcare includes antenatal care, postnatal care and institutional delivery services.</s>
          <s>These services are provided in every health facility by all healthcare providers but mainly by midwives and gynaecologists.</s>
          <s>Preconception care is not a specified area of care in any of these facilities.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The authors of this study purposively selected Hawassa City Administration as the study area.</s>
          <s>Selection of the study area considered the goals of the study, feasibility issues, and the availability of all healthcare providers working at all levels of the referral system located at both rural and urban areas.</s>
          <s id="0" type="Tabular data:Research Subjects">The study sample of healthcare providers in public health institutions in Hawassa was randomly selected by using the employers register as a sampling frame.</s>
          <s>The sampled healthcare professionals were all taken proportional to their profession, their number, and the type of health facility where they are working.</s>
          <s>Healthcare workers who were employed for less than six months were excluded from the study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Multistage sampling technique was applied to draw a total of 647 HCPs.</s>
          <s>The minimum sample size required for the study was determined by using a single population proportion formula.</s>
          <s>While computing the minimum sample size, the following parameters were considered: a 0.05 margin of error (α), a 95% Confidence Interval (CI), a 50% estimated proportion of healthcare providers' knowledge about preconception care, 10% non-response rate and a design effect of 2. The design effect (DEEF) was calculated with the formula DEEF = 1+ δ (n-1).</s>
          <s>The "δ" or the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated from the cluster data by using SPSS and it was found 0.169.</s>
          <s>Since the average size of clusters (n) was 11/2 = 5.5, the final DEEF was determinedas 1.79 % 2. Given that the total number of HCPs working in PHIs of the study area was 1239, a population correction factor was considered.</s>
          <s>Due to the absence of a similar study or comparative study in the country we preferred taking a 50% proportion which is a proportion to yield adequate sample size.</s>

          <s>By using simple random sampling technique, 3 out of the 9 health centres were included in the study.</s>
          <s>Since the remaining two public hospitals were quite different in their level and type, both were selected.</s>
          <s>The study population was also stratified in terms of profession.</s>
          <s>In the second stage, HCPs were selected by the systematic random sampling method using employer's employee registry document as a sampling frame.</s>
          <s>The study participants were all taken from each strata using probability proportional to size method.</s>
          <s>All HCPs were selected and consented to participate in the study without any coercion.</s>

          <s>A data collection tool, namely ' Andarg-Ethio PCC-KAP-Questionnaire for HCP', based on literature and evidence-based guidelines on PCC was developed and validated by the principal investigator to conduct this research project.</s>
          <s>The instrument was tested for content and facevalidity by a panel of experts and was scored with a content validity index (CVI) of 92.4%.</s>
          <s>The reliability of the instrument was checked for its internal consistency with a Cronbach's α test and demonstrated a score of 0.945 <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>

          <s>There were two field supervisors.</s>
          <s>The principal investigator was the main supervisor throughout the study.</s>
          <s>The data collected was entered to the SPSS version 20 software by an experienced statistician.</s>
          <s>The analysis used descriptive statistics such as frequency, proportion, standard deviation, mean, mode and range to describe the variables of the study.</s>
          <s>In addition, the inferential statistics applied a binary and multiple logistic regression analytical models to determine the crude (COR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) respectively.</s>
          <s>The analysis was all made fixing CI at 95%.</s>
          <s>The variables with their P-Value of less than 0.20 were all considered in the second or multivariate logistic regression model.</s>
          <s>The second analytical step used a stepwise backward model to determine factors associated with 'HCP's good PCC knowledge'.</s>
          <s>The goodness of fit of the models was tested by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.</s>
          <s>Thus, the model which was found to be greater than the significance level (P-value = 0.05) was accepted.</s>

          <s>The knowledge of healthcare providers on PCC is the most important determinant of implementation of a healthcare intervention.</s>
          <s>Healthcare providers don't usually practice what they don't know <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The current study demonstrated poor PCC knowledge among the greater proportion (43%) and higher PCC knowledge among 31% of the healthcare providers working in public health institutions of Hawassa.</s>
          <s>This finding is nearly consistent with the findings in a survey conducted in Egypt that reported higher knowledge among only 22% of healthcare providers <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Another study conducted in Iran reported a moderate level of PCC among 30-67% of healthcare providers.</s>
          <s>According to the report, providers with poor knowledge of PCC were 11.7% <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Unlike Ethiopia, the implementation of PCC in Iran existed years before the reported research was conducted which resulted in health providers having being exposed to a longer period of access to information on PCC <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A study conducted in Ontario Canada reported poor PCC knowledge as one of the barriers of physicians to provide PCC <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In the current study, the level of PCC knowledge varies amongst the study participants with a range of knowledge score 0-16 (M = 9.44, SD = 2.4).The study also identified items equally and correctly responded by all healthcare providers who participated in the study.</s>
          <s>The similarities of awareness included the health benefits of folic acid supplementation, adequate interpregnancy spacing, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV infection, family planning, nutrition, and stabilization of chronic disease before pregnancy.</s>
          <s>These commonalities may be linked to the inclusion of these preconception care-related topics that are included in curriculums and national guidelines.</s>
          <s>Whereas, the variation noted in the level of awareness may be due to the non-inclusion of standardized PCC training in pre-service courses in primary healthcare curricula <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Identifying factors or indicators in terms of the level of knowledge on PCC is vital input to programs targeting enhancement of provider's knowledge.</s>
          <s>Literature on this study field did not report extensively on factors that impact on the knowledge levels of PCC amongst healthcare providers.</s>
          <s>The following indicators however can be predictive indicators of knowledge on preconception care: inclusion/non-inclusion of PCC in training curricula, the inclusion/ exclusion of PCC as part of in-service programmes; and the provision/absence of guidelines or protocols on PCC <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2,</ref>

          <s>It was reported in one study that there is proportional variance in knowledge levels between healthcare providers with different professional backgrounds <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In the current study, however, professional background and educational level were not key predictors of their knowledge.</s>

          <s>There is poor knowledge among most of the healthcare providers.</s>
          <s>The proportion of healthcare providers who exhibited an acceptable level or higher PCC knowledge was 31%.</s>
          <s>About one fourth (26%) of the HCPs were found with medium or fair level of PCC knowledge.</s>
          <s>The remaining 43% had low or poor PCC knowledge.</s>
          <s>The odds of having good PCC knowledge was high among HCPs working in Hospitals, HCPs using their smart phone to access clinical resources, among those HCPs ever read PCC guideline prepared by an organization from outside of Ethiopia, among those who claimed to practice PCC, and among those who earn a salary of!146.0$.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The value of this study is that it assessed the HCP's knowledge of PCC and factors associated with their good PCC knowledge for the first time in Ethiopia.</s>
          <s>The study findings can serve as an input to enhance the practitioner's knowledge on PCC and in so doing impact positively on pregnancy outcomes.</s>
          <s>It can also serve as baseline evidence to compare the results of future similar research findings and to assess the effect of a future corrective intervention on the HCP's knowledge status.</s>
          <s>The identified factors associated with HCP's good PCC knowledge can help program planners and decision makers who work towards changing the current providers PCC knowledge status.</s>

          <s>Despite the proactive steps taken to reduce or limit their occurrences, the possibility of recall and social desirability bias are anticipated.</s>
          <s>The findings of this study may be applicable to HCPs working in other parts of the country; nevertheless, the generalization of the study findings beyond the target population needs prudence.</s>

        <head>Recommendations</head>
        <p>
          <s>Based on the findings of this study the following recommendations are forwarded.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• The Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Ministry of Education and other concerned organizations and individual stakeholders are advised to improve the observed poor PCC knowledge of the HCP's by providing continuous pre-service and in-service training.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• The Federal Ministry of Health and Regional health bureaus should consider to availing resources such as guidelines and other published information sources to increase the knowledge of HCPs working in the health centres by involving universities and other professional organisations.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• The authors recommend optimising the useof smartphone technology to download and sharing clinical practice like PCC and other guidelines to have up-to-date guidelines to practice or apply the evidence-based practice.</s>
          <s>Provision of access to technology as sources for information is highly recommended.</s>
          <s>This could take the form of an allowance to key stakeholders to use Internet or by providing Internet facilities in healthcare facilities</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• Revising the nature and content of in-service training and providing mentorship in the implementation of PCC at facility level will promote a positive attitude and increased knowledge on preconception care.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• It will be valuable to consider conducting a similar survey across the country in an ongoing fashion.</s>
          <s>These can be helpful in monitoring and evaluation of future corrective interventions.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>• The validated instrument used in this study can be used by other interested researchers.</s>
