            <s>Protein acetylation has a crucial role in energy metabolism.</s>
            <s>Here we performed the first large-scale profiling of acetylome in rat islets, showing that almost all enzymes in core metabolic pathways related to insulin secretion were acetylated.</s>
            <s>Label-free quantitative acetylome of islets in response to high glucose revealed hyperacetylation of enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), including trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha (ECHA).</s>
            <s>Acetylation decreased the protein stability of ECHA and its ability to promote FAO.</s>
            <s>The overexpression of SIRT3, a major mitochondrial deacetylase, prevented the degradation of ECHA via decreasing its acetylation level in β-cells.</s>
            <s>SIRT3 expression was upregulated in rat islets upon exposure to low glucose or fasting.</s>
            <s>SIRT3 overexpression in islets markedly decreased palmitate-potentiated insulin secretion, whereas islets from SIRT3 knockout mice secreted more insulin, with an opposite action on FAO.</s>
            <s>ECHA overexpression partially reversed SIRT3 deficiency-elicited insulin hypersecretion.</s>
            <s>Our study highlights the potential role of protein acetylation in insulin secretion.</s>

          <s>Acetylation level is tightly governed by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and deacetylases (KDACs) <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12</ref> .</s>
          <s>All KATs require acetyl-CoA as substrate for acetylation reactions.</s>
          <s>Another intermediary metabolite NAD + directly alters KDAC activities to link energy status to cellular homeostasis, making acetylation especially favorable in regulating metabolic enzymes.</s>

          <s>The primary stimulus for insulin secretion is glucose, whose metabolism is achieved by tightly linking glycolysis with mitochondrial metabolism <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13</ref> .</s>
          <s>Fatty acids also have enormous capacity to amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), in part via their metabolism into lipid signaling molecules <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14</ref> .</s>
          <s>Given that β-cell function is closely coupled to fuel metabolism and protein acetylation may be at the nexus of coordinating metabolic flux, it is reasonable to hypothesize that protein acetylation may provide a link between fuel metabolism and insulin secretion.</s>
          <s>It has been shown that inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevents cytokine-induced toxicity in β-cells <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15,</ref>
