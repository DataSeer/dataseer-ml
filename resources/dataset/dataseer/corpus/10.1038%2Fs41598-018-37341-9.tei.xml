            <s>Super-resolution localization microscopy provides a powerful tool to study biochemical mechanisms at single molecule level.</s>
            <s>Although the lateral position of the fluorescent dye molecules can be determined routinely with high precision, measurement of other modalities such as 3D and multicolor without the degradation of the original super-resolved image is still in the focus.</s>
            <s>In this paper a dual-objective multimodal single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) technique has been developed, optimized and tested.</s>
            <s>The proposed optical arrangement can be implemented onto a conventional inverted microscope without serious system modification.</s>
            <s>The performance of the method was tested using fluorescence beads, F-actin filaments and sarcomere structures.</s>
            <s>It was shown that the proposed imaging method does not degrade the image quality of the original SMLM 2D image but could provide information on the axial position or emission spectra of the dye molecules.</s>

            <s>Single molecule localization based super-resolution microscopy (SMLM) methods such as PALM 1,2 , FPALM 3 , STORM 4 , dSTORM 5 and GSDIM 6 provide the highest spatial resolution images captured via optical microscopy techniques.</s>
            <s>In these methods temporally and spatially isolated fluorescent molecules are imaged using traditional wide-field microscope systems.</s>
            <s>The images of these point-like single emitters are fitted by the theoretical point spread function (PSF) the center of which defines the lateral position of a molecule.</s>
            <s>A strictly controlled photoswitching process is required to keep the number of active fluorescent molecules at an optimum value during the data acquisition <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
            <s>In case of a high labeling density, the spatially overlapping PSFs preclude the precise localization of independent molecules, while at a low density the increased acquisition time limits the final image quality 8 .</s>
            <s>SMLM is a photon number limited technique.</s>
            <s>Single fluorescent dyes can typically emit a few thousand photons during a single ON stage, which determines the localization precision and consequently the final image quality <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref>
              <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
            <s>However, the emitted photons also carry information on the axial position and the local environment of the dye molecules.</s>

            <s>The stronger the dependency, the higher the axial localization precision.</s>
            <s>However, a serious distortion of the PSF can reduce both the axial range of the localization and the lateral resolution.</s>
            <s>PSF engineering methods are quasi-3D methods, since the mapped axial range is still limited by the depth-of-field (DOF), which is typically at around 1 micron.</s>

          <s>The proposed experimental setup was built on a standard inverted fluorescent microscope ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref> ).</s>
          <s>The collimated excitation beam (green lines) was focused into the back focal plane of the primary microscope objective (O1).</s>
          <s>In the EPI illumination mode half of the beam could be blocked by an aperture (Ap) placed in front of the focusing lens (L1), therefore only half of the original field of view (FOV) was excited.</s>
          <s>Although the excited fluorescent molecules emit photons in the full 4Pi solid angle, the traditional image is generated by photons captured by the microscope objective O1.</s>
          <s>Photons leaving the sample in the opposite direction typically do not contribute to the imaging process.</s>
          <s>Consequently, more than 50% of the emitted photons are lost even when extremely high numerical aperture (NA) objectives are used.</s>
          <s>The final image of a single fluorescent molecule (red dot) is formed on the detector (D) by means of an additional tube lens (TL), and can be described as the primary point spread function of the optical system.</s>
          <s>The black solid lines depict the image formation in the primary path.</s>
          <s>In the proposed dual objective configuration a secondary microscope objective (O2) was aligned opposite the primary one to collect photons emitted upwards.</s>
          <s>The numerical aperture of the applied objectives were 1.49 (O1) and 1.4 (O2), wherefore the emitted photons could be collected with high efficiency.</s>
          <s>When a secondary tube lens (L2) and a Porro prism were used, the secondary objective formed a mirror image in the other half of the FOV (black dot).</s>
          <s>In the secondary arm a spectral filter can be inserted to attenuate the excitation beam, eliminating the excitation of the sample via the back reflected beam.</s>
          <s>Alternatively, TIRF or HILO excitation can be applied to drastically reduce the throughput of the excitation beam (NA secondary &lt; NA primary ).</s>
          <s>During the measurement we used Hilo mode for the reduction of out of focus fluorescence and also to eliminate the excitation effect of the back reflected excitation beam.</s>
          <s>The secondary image was also generated via the primary objective, and the detector captured the P and S images simultaneously.</s>
          <s>The primary and secondary images of three fluorescent beads can be seen in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although all the optical components inserted into the secondary path were AR coated (see Section Optical Setup of Supplement), the intensity of the secondary image was typically around 50% of the primary one.</s>
          <s>The most significant source of light loss was the secondary microscope objective (T 647nm = 81%, T 561nm = 84%).</s>
          <s>For this reason the primary image was applied to determine the lateral position of the molecules, while the secondary image was used to evaluate the selected modality.</s>

          <s>Our method does not degrade lateral super-resolution, and nor does it introduce lateral anisotropy.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, it keeps the primary image unaffected, since the axial position is only determined by the secondary image.</s>

          <s>The emitted, partially polarized fluorescent light ( <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(b,ii)</ref> ) can also be filtered by a polarizer, selecting one particular polarization component (red dots in <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Fig. 1(b,ii)</ref> ).</s>

          <s>Since the secondary path is a complex system that contains several optical components the misalignment of which can introduce significant optical aberrations, the complete system was modeled (see the OSLO model in <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">Fig. S3</ref> and more details on simulations in the Computer simulation of the optical setup section of the Supplement), and the calculated primary and secondary PSFs were evaluated by OSLO (Optics Software for Layout and Optimization) <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">47</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>A multimodal single molecule localization microscopy technique was developed, optimized and tested.</s>
          <s>The emitted photons of single fluorescent molecules were collected by a dual objective setup, and primary and secondary mirror images were captured simultaneously on a single detector.</s>
          <s>Comparative simulation and experimental study proved the feasibility and applicability of the secondary image for SMLM.</s>
          <s>It was also shown that the overall quality of the primary image was not affected, since the secondary image was generated independently by photons emitted in the direction opposite to the primary objective.</s>
          <s>(moreover false positive localizations can be eliminated by an optimized pair finding algorithm).</s>
          <s>Astigmatic and biplane 3D imaging techniques were demonstrated using sarcomere structures, while two-color imaging was tested by means of beads.</s>
          <s>At low labeling density (approximately half of the normal value applied for dSTORM) the full camera frame can be applied, and the proposed method does not degrade the FOV.</s>
          <s>Future work will focus on polarization and spectral sensitive detections through the insertion of a polarizer and dispersion prism into the secondary arm.</s>
          <s>We are also planning to redesign the setup and build a more compact setup based on a knife edge prism that reduces the size of the unusable area between the S and P images.</s>
