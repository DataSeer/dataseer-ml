        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>The intestinal epithelium is composed of a single layer of epithelial cells that are rapidly renewed through proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells <ref type="bibr">(ISCs)</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to digestion and absorption of nutrients, the intestinal epithelium also serves as a defensive barrier to prevent against infection of gut pathogens.</s>
          <s>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) consist of stem cells, proliferating progenitor cells and highly differentiated absorptive and secretory cells.</s>
          <s>Whereas absorptive enterocytes are responsible for nutrient absorption, professional secretory cells such as Paneth and goblet cells have a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity.</s>
          <s>Goblet cells synthesize and secrete mucin proteins, the major component of intestinal mucus that protects the epithelium from bacterial infection 1 .</s>
          <s>Paneth cells are responsible for synthesis and secretion of a large quantity of antimicrobial peptides that maintain homeostatic microbiota in the gut <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2,</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">3</ref> .</s>
          <s>They also have a crucial role in the formation of ISC niche and regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of ISCs under conditions such as calorie restriction <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref> .</s>
          <s>A breakdown of intestinal tissue homeostasis may lead to human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</s>
          <s>Loss of Paneth cells or impairment of their normal function is often observed in the IBD patients and contributes to disease pathogenesis <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7</ref> .</s>
          <s>Goblet cell deficiency or dysfunction is also causative for ulcerative colitis (UC) <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8,</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, elucidation of the underlying mechanism that governs development, survival and function of Paneth and goblet cells would be crucial for development of novel therapies for inflammatory diseases.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Post-translational modification of target proteins by Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifiers has important roles in multiple cellular processes, and dysfunction of this process has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> .</s>
          <s>Ufm1 (Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) is a small Ubl modifier with 85 amino acid residues and highly conserved in multicellular organisms <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>With a limited primary sequence identity with Ub and other Ubls, Ufm1 displays a solution structure of ubiquitin-fold that is shared by other Ubls 12 .</s>
          <s>However, unlike Ub and some Ubls with di-glycine (GG) residues at the carboxyl (C)-terminus of their active forms, the active Ufm1 contains Valine-Glycine (VG) residues at its C-terminus, and its Glycine residue is covalently conjugated to the lysine residues of target proteins via an iso-peptide bond.</s>
          <s>Ufm1 conjugation to its target proteins, a process termed as ufmylation, is accomplished in multi-step biochemical reactions that are catalyzed by a set of Ufm1-specific enzymes, namely, Ufm1-activating E1 enzyme Uba5, Ufm1-conjugating E2 enzyme Ufc1, and Ufm1-specific E3 ligase(s) <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the identity of Ufm1 targets and the mechanism to control this conjugating process is poorly understood.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although Ufm1-sepcific E1 (Uba5) and E2 (Ufc1) enzymes share signature domains with other E1s and E2s, only one Ufm1-specific E3 ligase has been identified so far and this E3 ligase does not contain any conventional E3 ligase domains or motifs that mediate ubiquitination or ubiquitination-like modifications.</s>
          <s>Ufl1 (Ufm1 ligase 1, as known as KIAA0776, RCAD, NLBP and Maxer) was originally isolated by several independent studies as a novel Cdk5rap3-binding protein and regulator of NF-κB signaling <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, Tatsumi et al. found that Ufl1 promoted ufmylation of Ufbp1 (Ufm1 binding protein 1, also named as DDRGK1, C20orf116 and Dashurin), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored Ufl1-binding protein <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study provided biochemical evidence for the notion that Ufl1 may function as a Ufm1-specific E3 ligase.</s>
          <s>Yoo et al. subsequently found that Ufl1 also promoted ufmylation of ASC1 (Activating Signal Cointegrator 1, also known as TRIP4), a transcription coactivator of nuclear receptors <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">18,</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>In breast cancer cells, ufmylated ASC1 serves as a platform to facilitate recruitment of estrogen receptor and other transcription co-activators and enhance transcription of target genes, thereby promoting breast cancer development <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, ufmylated Ufbp1 functions as a co-factor in the process of ASC1 ufmylation <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since its discovery more than a decade ago, the physiological function of the Ufm1 conjugation system has remained unclear until very recently.</s>
          <s>Genetic studies using gene knockout (KO) mouse models have provided undisputable evidence for its essential role in animal development.</s>
          <s>Germline deletion of individual ufmylation genes, including Uba5, Ufl1 and Ufbp1, led to impaired red blood cell development and embryonic lethality around E11.5-E13.5 days <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Acute ablation of either Ufl1 or Ufbp1 in adult mice caused pancytopenia and severe anemia, further highlighting the indispensable role of ufmyation in erythropoiesis <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition to its role in animal development, multiple lines of evidence indicate involvement of the ufmylation pathway in the pathogenesis of various human dieseases, including hematopoietic diseases <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">23,</ref>

          <s>Furthermore, loss-of-function mutation in Ufbp1 gene was found to be a causative factor in Shohat-type spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), a skeletal dysplasia that affects cartilage development <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s>

          <s>Taken together, these recent findings underscore the importance of the Ufm1 system in normal development and physiology.</s>

          <s>In addition to ubiquitous expression of ufmylation-related genes in many cell types and tissues, we found that the components of the Ufm1 system, including Ufl1 and Ufbp1, were highly expressed in intestinal exocrine cells that contain very rich ER structure <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, Ufm1 was reported to be a target of secretory cell-specific transcription factor MIST1 57 , while several ufmylation-related genes are transcriptionally regulated by Xbp-1, a key transcription factor of the UPR <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">42</ref> .</s>
          <s>The expression profile of these ufmylation genes is consistent with their functional role in the cells with rich ER structure.</s>

          <s>Our previous and current studies have demonstrated that knockout of either Ufl1 or Ufbp1 resulted in elevated ER stress and activation of the UPR in various types of cells, including hematopoietic and intestinal cells <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">( 21,</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> and the results in this manuscript).</s>
          <s>Intriguingly, our findings were consistent with the results of recent studies conducted by DeJesus et al. <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">59</ref> and Terai et al. <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">60</ref> In genome-wide CRISPR/ cas9 screenings, knockout of the ufmylation genes triggered the UPR activation in multiple cancer cell lines <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">59,</ref>
            <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">60</ref> .</s>
          <s>Taken together, the recent findings strongly suggest that the ufmylation pathway is a novel mechanism to regulate ER homeostasis and function, and deficiency of ufmylation may cause perturbation of ER homeostasis and elevated ER stress that leads to apoptosis of exocrine cells.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The next question is how ufmylation is engaged in the maintenance of ER homeostasis.</s>
          <s>One possible scenario is that the ufmylation pathway may modulate the activity of the key UPR player(s) in a direct manner.</s>
          <s>Liu et al. <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">61</ref> reported that Ufbp1 can directly interact and stabilize IRE1α, and knockdown of Ufbp1 resulted in IRE1α degradation and attenuation of the IRE1α-Xbp1 signaling, which in turn activated the PERK signaling.</s>
          <s>However, in contrast to their findings, we found that Ufbp1 deficiency led to IRE1α upregulation and robust Xbp-1 activation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Our finding is in agreement with the study by Terai et al. <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">60</ref> , showing that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ufmylation genes in lung cancer cells specifically activated the IRE1α-Xbp1 branch.</s>
          <s>Apparently, more work is needed to establish the molecular link(s), either direct or indirect, between the ufmylation and UPR pathways.</s>
          <s>Another scenario is that the ufmylation pathway may be involved in controlling ER-related functions such as protein synthesis, modification, folding and secretion, and its deficiency may lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein, thereby resulting in ER stress elevation and UPR activation.</s>
          <s>Recently, Simsek et al. <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">62</ref> reported that Ufl1 was one of ribosome-associated proteins, and several ribosomal subunits and elongation factor eIF6 were potential Ufm1 targets.</s>
          <s>This finding indicates a potential role of ufmylation in control of protein translation.</s>
          <s>Interestingly enough, protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide can promote Ufm1 conjugation in tissue culture cells <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41,</ref>
            <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">42</ref> .</s>
          <s>We speculate that the ufmylation pathway may represent a novel generic mechanism to co-ordinate protein translation and protein quality control in the ER.</s>
          <s>Further study, especially identification and characterization of Ufm1 targets and their interacting proteins, is needed to test this hypothesis.</s>
          <s>In summary, our current work uncovered a crucial link between the ufmylation pathway and intestinal homeostasis.</s>
