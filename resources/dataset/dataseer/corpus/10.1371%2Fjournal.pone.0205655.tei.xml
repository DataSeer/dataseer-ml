          <s>Introduction Each year about 125,000 U.S. patients are diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> and must either undergo life-long dialysis therapy or obtain a kidney transplant.</s>
          <s>Only about 31,000 of these patients are added to the transplant waiting list each year, and a little more than half that number actually receive transplants because of a serious and growing shortage of transplantable kidneys <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Consequently, the number of U.S. patients requiring maintenance dialysis now approaches half a million, and the number on the transplant waiting list has risen to nearly 100,000 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Waiting time for a deceased donor kidney has steadily increased to an average of almost five years, and in many regions wait-time now exceeds life expectancy.</s>
          <s>Most tragically, each year almost 5,000 patients on the waiting list die and another 4,000 are removed because they are considered too sick to undergo the transplant operation <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is a consensus among economists that the main cause of the kidney shortage is the legal prohibition against compensating kidney donors, and that the shortage could be ended if compensation were permitted <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>

        <p>
          <s>Held-McCormick et al. <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> have estimated the discounted present value of the economic benefit of a kidney transplant over a recipient's lifetime in two situations.</s>
          <s>The first is for current conditions in the U.S. in which donor compensation is prohibited and as a result there is a serious shortage of transplant kidneys.</s>
          <s>Consequently, transplant recipients are able to obtain, on average, only one transplant, the value of which is approximately $937,000 ( <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In the second situation, donors are compensated for the fair market value of a kidney, which would likely end the kidney shortage.</s>
          <s>With kidneys readily available, transplant recipients would be able to obtain, on average, two transplants, with a total estimated value of $1,330,000 ( <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> ).</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#tab_0" type="table">(The average waiting list patient who receives a first transplant has a life expectancy of 19.3</ref> years, but the average graft lasts only 12.6 years.</s>

        <head>The exploitation of kidney donors</head>
        <p>
          <s>The term exploitation is defined as paying less than the fair market value of the good or service being sold.</s>
          <s>This definition is well grounded in the economics literature <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28]</ref> and is often employed by respected ethicists <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, the fair market value of a kidney from a living donor is not known because the National Organ Transplant Act prohibits the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>To estimate the fair market value (see S1 File), we begin with the fact that Medicare pays organ procurement organizations (OPOs) about $55,000 for a kidney from a deceased donor <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>But a kidney from a living donor is worth more than one from a deceased donor because the expected functional life of a graft from a living donor (for a person on the kidney waiting list) is about 43% longer <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This alone would boost the value of a living donor kidney by $23,650.</s>
          <s>In addition, when a kidney transplant fails, a patient typically incurs costs totaling about $233,000 ($88,000 for the cost of graft failure plus $145,000 for a second kidney transplant <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> ).</s>
          <s>For a living donor kidney, this cost occurs 4.2 years later than for a deceased donor kidney.</s>
          <s>So using a real discount rate of 3%, the delay in incurring this expense makes a kidney from a living donor more valuable by $20,665.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>On the other hand, it costs about $20,000 to remove a kidney from a living donor <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref> and about $5,000 for the tests of the donor beforehand, both of which reduce the value of a donated kidney.</s>
          <s>So taking all of these factors into consideration, the estimated value of a kidney from a living donor is roughly $75,000 ($55,000 + $23,650 + $20,665 -$25,000 = $74,315).</s>
          <s>This is the amount the government would initially offer for a kidney from a living donor.</s>
          <s>Over time, the government would likely adjust this amount to balance the quantity of kidneys supplied and demanded.</s>
          <s>In any event, we will see below that our conclusions do not depend crucially on the exact magnitude of this value because it is compared to the benefit that poor kidney recipients receive from a transplant, which is more than an order of magnitude larger.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Thus, at the current time when donor compensation is prohibited, a living donor is paid nothing for a kidney that has a value of about $75,000, so the amount of exploitation (as we have defined it) is $75,000 ( Indeed, if policymakers conclude (or pilot studies suggest) an even greater sum is needed to ensure that donors are not exploited, the government could easily afford to increase compensation above $75,000.</s>
          <s>The savings from stopping dialysis after transplantation are so great that compensation could be increased to as much as $320,000 per kidney <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> before the taxpayer would no longer save money by having the government compensate donors.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>It is clear that exploitation of kidney donors, as we have defined it, applies to kidney donors of all income levels.</s>
          <s>However, since the distinguished critics of donor compensation focus on the exploitation of the poor, we will address that criticism.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Data on the income levels of kidney donors and recipients is not readily available, but data on educational level, a recognized proxy for income (see S4 File), is available for kidney recipients.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we will define the poor as adults who have not graduated from high school, which is about 12% of the U.S. population.</s>
          <s>(According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.5% of the U.S. population lived in poverty in 2015 <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .)</s>

          <s>Given these definitions and preliminary calculations, the exploitation of poor kidney donors was compared with the benefit that poor kidney recipients receive from a transplant to estimate the net effect on the poor in three different situations.</s>
          <s>The first is the current situation in the U.S. where compensation of kidney donors is prohibited.</s>
          <s>In the second, the government compensates living kidney donors the $75,000 fair market value of a kidney under realistic (but conservative) assumptions about the response of poor donors and recipients.</s>
          <s>The third situation is a sensitivity analysis to show how robust the conclusions of Situation 2 are-the government again compensates living kidney donors $75,000, but under assumptions that are very pessimistic for the welfare of the poor.</s>
          <s>b.</s>
          <s>This causes the number of kidney transplants to increase to more than 31,000 per year (enough to supply the yearly additions to the kidney transplant waiting list).</s>

          <s>The estimated value of kidney transplantation to a poor kidney recipient is so large ($1,330,000), and the purported exploitation of a poor kidney donor is so small (zero to $75,000), that any reasonable alternative assumptions would likely yield the same conclusion-that the poor as a group would be far better off if donors were compensated.</s>

          <s>They receive only 17% of kidney transplants (half of their 34% share of the kidney failure population).</s>
          <s>Then under these pessimistic assumptions for the welfare of the poor, the aggregate exploitation of poor kidney donors would again be zero, and the aggregate benefit to poor kidney recipients would be $7.0B/yr.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The barriers the poor face in obtaining transplants <ref type="bibr">Fig 2</ref> clearly indicates the biggest barrier poor patients face in obtaining a deceased donor kidney is being placed on the waiting list, not getting a transplant once on the list (where the current system seems to work reasonably well in allocating deceased donor kidneys to the poor).</s>
          <s>This wait list admission problem does not necessarily reflect deliberate discrimination against the poor.</s>
          <s>Instead, given the severe kidney shortage under the current system, admission to the waiting list must be limited by some criteria, and these criteria favor the healthier candidates with the best prospects for a successful transplant-who happen to be the more affluent.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>With regard to kidneys from living donors, the problem for poor recipients is that most of their relatives and friends are also poor and hence less able to bear the burden of being a living donor (lost wages, etc.).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Both barriers for the poor could be circumvented by government compensation of kidney donors because that would end the kidney shortage.</s>
          <s>Enough kidneys would be available for all who needed one, rich or poor.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Note, however, that even if the kidney shortage is ended, poor patients may not receive kidney transplants in full proportion to their 34% share of the ESRD population because of other factors.</s>
          <s>For example, many non-elderly Medicare patients lose all Medicare coverage including immunosuppressive therapy 36 months after a transplant <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>That policy creates an incentive for patients, particularly the poor and young, to not even apply for a transplant.</s>
          <s>Also, the poor are more likely to live in rural areas, far from a transplant center, making it difficult for them to travel to a center to apply for the waiting list or to receive a transplant.</s>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>
          <s>The purpose of this study was to empirically test the hypothesis that government compensation of kidney donors would exploit the poor.</s>
          <s>We concluded that if the government rewards living kidney donors with a package of non-cash benefits worth about $75,000 per kidney, donors would not be exploited.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Much more important, compensation would likely end the kidney shortage, enabling many more patients with kidney failure to obtain transplants and live longer and healthier lives.</s>
          <s>The value of transplantation to a U.S. recipient is about $1,330,000, which is an order of magnitude greater than any supposed exploitation of living kidney donors (zero to $75,000 per donor).</s>
          <s>Indeed, compensating kidney donors would increase the aggregate benefit to the poor from transplantation about 13-fold to $12.4 billion per year from $0.9 billion currently.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Note this is not a case of one group of poor people benefiting from government compensation of kidney donors while another group of poor people is made worse off.</s>
          <s>Rather, poor kidney recipients are greatly benefited, but poor kidney donors are no worse off because they are compensated for the fair market value of their kidney.</s>
          <s>Moreover, if the government chooses to compensate kidney donors more than $75,000-which it could easily afford to do and still save money for the taxpayer-it could ensure poor donors would also be better off, i.e., they would also receive a net benefit.</s>

        <figDesc>and Fig 1 summarize the calculations and results for the three situations. Situation 1: Current conditions in the U.S. a. Compensation of kidney donors is prohibited, b. Partly as a result, only about 17,500 transplants take place each year (using kidneys from both living and deceased donors), c. The poor receive only 6% of these transplants [32] (much less than their 12% share of the general population and their 34% share [33] of patients newly diagnosed with ESRD), d. The poor provide an estimated 4% of living donor kidneys (close to the 3% share of living donor kidneys they receive) [32]. Since donor compensation is prohibited, the exploitation of an individual living kidney donor is the maximum amount: $75,000. And if we make the conservative simplifying assumption that the level of exploitation of deceased kidney donors is the same as for living donors (see S2 File), then the aggregate exploitation of all poor kidney donors is $0.1B/yr. [= 17,500 trans- plants/yr. X 4% of transplant kidneys donated by the poor X exploitation of $75,000 per donor]. Nonetheless, even this slight over-estimate is still an order of magnitude less than the aggregate benefit to all poor kidney recipients, which is $1.0B/yr. [= 17,500 transplants/yr. X 6% of transplant kidneys received by the poor X $937,000 benefit per recipient from one trans- plant]. Therefore, under current conditions, the net benefit to the poor as a group from trans- plantation is $0.9B/yr. (See Table 2, row 1, columns 6-8.) Situation 2: Donor compensation of $75,000 under realistic assumptions a. Now assume the government increases the compensation of living kidney donors from zero to the $75,000 fair market value of a kidney.</figDesc>
