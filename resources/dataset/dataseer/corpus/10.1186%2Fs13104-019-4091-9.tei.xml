        <p>
          <s>Globally, 150 million people per year suffer from financial catastrophic shock, and 100 million are pushed into poverty because of direct payments for health services.</s>
          <s>In the majority of African countries, more than 40% of their total health expenditure was constituted by out-of-pocket payment (OPP) and this resulted in scarcity of funds for health <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As a result of this, developing health financing system was a common agenda for all countries <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In Ethiopia OPP accounts 37% of the total spending in health care.</s>
          <s>This leads to financial catastrophic shock <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To overcome these challenges an efficient and equitable health care financing strategy was formulated <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The immediate goals of universal health coverage (UHC) are access, utilization and financial protection, while health status is a longer-term indirect result (although probably the ultimate goal), and one of the key strategies is reducing direct payments <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The government of Ethiopia has introduced Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) as strategy for reducing financial catastrophic shock in our country, and it has been piloted in selected districts of the country.</s>
          <s>The utilization of scheme by the community members were affected by different factors such as socio-demographic, economic and health related factors <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A pilot study in Ethiopia has indicated that the scheme provides a benefit package of all available services in the health centres and hospitals excluding tooth implantation and eyeglasses with the provider payment mechanism of fee-for-service.</s>
          <s>Accordingly, the membership for the scheme could be all core family members <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8,</ref>

          <s>This implies the communities were WTP higher money than the proposed payment during the study period which was 140 up to 195 ETB.</s>
          <s>But the amount of money respondents WTP was consistent with the newly proposed premium which is 240.</s>
