            <s>Preclinical studies demonstrated that radiation up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, providing a rationale for combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with radiation.</s>
            <s>However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies.</s>
            <s>Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor.</s>
            <s>In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip.</s>
            <s>PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment.</s>
            <s>Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml.</s>
            <s>After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%,</s>
            <s>P &lt; 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation.</s>
            <s>In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS.</s>
            <s>Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis.</s>
            <s>Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment.</s>
