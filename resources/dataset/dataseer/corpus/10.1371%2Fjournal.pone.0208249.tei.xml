            <s>Beyond its anti-fibrinolytic mechanism, tranexamic acid has been suggested to have antiinflammatory properties which may contribute to the survival benefit it provides to trauma patients.</s>
            <s>The objective of this study was to assess possible immunomodulatory effects of tranexamic acid as well as potential amelioration of end-organ injury in a rodent hemorrhagic shock model.</s>
            <s>Controlled hemorrhagic shock was induced in adult Sprague Dawley rats to a mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg.</s>
            <s>Groups of 10 rats were administered intravenous tranexamic acid (300mg/kg) or vehicle control (normal saline) intravenously 15 minutes after the induction of shock.</s>
            <s>After 60 minutes of hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation was started.</s>
            <s>Animals were euthanized at six, 24, or 72 hours from the start of shock.</s>
            <s>Serum laboratory values to include inflammatory biomarkers were measured, and end organ histology was evaluated.</s>
            <s>Tranexamic acid treatment was associated with a significant decrease in serum IL-1β at six and 24 hours and IL-10 at 24 hours from start of shock compared to vehicle control.</s>
            <s>Histologic analysis demonstrated mild decreases in both perivascular pulmonary edema and follicular mesenteric lymph node hyperplasia in the tranexamic acid treatment group but also increased myocardial lymphocytic infiltration with necrosis and degeneration.</s>
            <s>Tranexamic acid was also associated with a small but significant increase in peripheral neutrophil count as well as a significant decrease in neutrophil aggregation in pulmonary tissue at six hours post-injury.</s>
            <s>These data thus demonstrate a mixed effect of tranexamic acid.</s>
            <s>While there was an improvement in pulmonary edema and a suppressive effect on several key inflammatory mediators, there was also increased myocardial degeneration and necrosis, which is possibly related to the pro-thrombotic effect of tranexamic acid.</s>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
          <s>Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a leading cause of preventable death in civilian and military trauma patients <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a pharmacologic adjunct that can be given to <ref type="bibr">PLOS</ref> patients in or at risk for HS.</s>
          <s>TXA is a synthetic lysine derivative that prevents fibrinolysis by blocking the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of TXA to decrease intraoperative blood loss and blood product requirements in elective surgeries <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In CRASH-2 and MATTERs, two more recent studies evaluating the effectiveness of TXA in trauma patients, TXA administration was associated with improved survival in civilian and military trauma patients, respectively <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While the CRASH-2 study reported a decreased rate of death attributed to hemorrhage in patients who received TXA, there was not a significant difference in the need for transfusion between treatment and placebo groups.</s>
          <s>The MATTERs study showed that there was actually a higher transfusion requirement in a matched cohort that received TXA as well as a survival benefit that began at 48 hours post-injury, a time point where the risk of death from hemorrhage is typically decreased <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>These findings have contributed to speculation that TXA may have an alternative mechanism of action contributing to improved survival in trauma patients.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that this beneficial effect of TXA is related to its potential anti-inflammatory effects.</s>
          <s>Plasmin promotes an upregulation of the inflammatory cascade via activation of pro-inflammatory cells and induction of pro-inflammatory genes <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>By inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, TXA may mitigate the inflammatory response associated with HS.</s>
          <s>Notably, in cardiac surgery patients who have been placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, TXA has been shown to diminish the systemic inflammatory response <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10,</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">11]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Recently, a US Department of Defense review committee published an assessment of knowledge gaps and research requirements regarding TXA in trauma <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The authors described the need for further data regarding the mechanism by which TXA benefits trauma patients as well as potential adverse effects.</s>
          <s>With that in mind, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of TXA in mitigating systemic inflammation and reducing the severity of end-organ injury in a rat model of HS.</s>
          <s>We hypothesized that TXA administration may attenuate the initiation and propagation of HS-induced systemic inflammation as well as end-organ injury.</s>

          <s>TXA has been shown to improve mortality in trauma patients.</s>
          <s>This mortality benefit has been suggested to be related in part to TXA's anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its antifibrinolytic effects, as TXA has not been shown to decrease the need for blood transfusions in this patient population <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>

          <s>This study demonstrated a suppressive effect of TXA on IL-1β, IL-10, and MIP-1α expression following HS.</s>
          <s>TXA was also associated with a decrease in splenic CD8+ T cell counts as well as splenic and peripheral CD4+ T cells.</s>
          <s>However, any associated end-organ effects between TXA and inflammation were mixed in this study.</s>
          <s>Pulmonary perivascular edema was decreased with TXA in addition to decreased neutrophil infiltration, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit.</s>
          <s>In contrast, there was also evidence of increased myocardial degeneration and necrosis in the treatment arm, possibly attributed to the antifibrinolytic properties of TXA.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are multiple potential mechanisms by which TXA has anti-inflammatory effects.</s>
          <s>IL-1β was decreased in the TXA group at 24 hours post-injury.</s>
          <s>IL-1β is associated with a proinflammatory cell death process known as pyroptosis and is a vital cytokine in the inflammasome response to injury <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There is evidence that TXA decreases nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As NF-κB is the transcription factor that promotes the expression of pro IL-1β, this may be the mechanism by which TXA decreases IL-1β levels.</s>
          <s>Additionally, plasmin has been shown to be associated with increased capillary permeability in hyperfibrinolytic states <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>By inhibiting the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin, TXA may decrease the amount of capillary leak present.</s>
          <s>Lastly, TXA in this study appears to reduce the levels of T cells that may play a role in early innate immune responses and not just later cell-mediated responses <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A reduction in circulating IL-10 levels was found in the TXA treatment arm of this study.</s>
          <s>Although IL-10 is a regulatory cytokine in the systemic inflammatory response <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[26]</ref> , its systemic production and secretion has been shown to be increased in more severely injured trauma patients with worse outcomes <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This suggests that the increased synthesis of IL-10 may be associated with a dysregulated immune system that is contributing to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and could account or increased overall inflammation in the control arm.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>This study is consistent with other HS and polytrauma animal models that have shown or suggested a suppressive effect of TXA on inflammation.</s>
          <s>Wu et al. demonstrated in a polytrauma + HS rodent model that TXA treatment decreased pulmonary edema along with other markers of pulmonary inflammation to include leukocyte and platelet infiltration.</s>
          <s>In addition, they demonstrated a decrease in lung tissue MCP-1 and migrating monocytes with TXA administration <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The authors, however, did not measure serum cytokines in their model, and they euthanized all rats one hour after resuscitation.</s>
          <s>Thus, there was no short-term period to evaluate the inflammatory response as was done in this study, wherein several key systemic inflammatory mediators were assessed up to 72 hours post-injury.</s>
          <s>Peng et al. showed that administration of oral TXA to rats following HS resulted in decreased gut and lung inflammation and injury by inhibiting the effects of ADAM-17 and TNF-α on intestinal syndecan-1, which weakens underlying gut mucosa in a typical pro-inflammatory state <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>No notable changes in gut histology were seen in this current study, however TXA was administered intravenously as opposed to orally.</s>
          <s>Although the benefit of TXA is associated in large part with its antifibrinolytic properties, Roy and colleagues demonstrated a survival benefit associated with TXA in rats in HS despite the absence of fibrinolysis measured on rotational thromboelastometry <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Their findings support the hypothesis of an alternative mechanism, other than through anti-fibrinolysis, by which TXA provides a survival benefit.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Other studies have shown little to no effects of TXA on serum inflammatory markers.</s>
          <s>Boudreau et al demonstrated a marked increase in serum levels of IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and RANTES when HS to a systolic blood pressure of 25mmHg for one hour was added to a murine closed traumatic brain injury (TBI) model <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[31]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, there was no difference in the circulating level of these inflammatory markers with TXA administration.</s>
          <s>Of note, the authors administered an intraperitoneal injection of TXA as opposed to the standard intravenous or oral versions of TXA.</s>
          <s>Additionally, they gave a TXA dose of 10 mg/kg, which is less than the 300 mg/kg dose used in this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>With regard to end-organ injury, the decreased pulmonary edema and neutrophil infiltration observed in this study with TXA treatment is consistent with previous findings which report that TXA mitigates acute lung injury, including lung edema <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although post-HS mesenteric lymph has been shown to play a role in acute lung injury and acute kidney injury in these patients <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[32,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">33]</ref> , it is unclear if the decreased mesenteric lymph node follicular hyperplasia observed in the current TXA study has a role in decreased systemic inflammation given that these lesions can often take more than 72 hours to appear.</s>
          <s>The increase in the peripheral neutrophil count in the TXA group at 6 hours post-injury was unexpected.</s>
          <s>This perhaps represents a quicker demargination in the TXA group as the neutrophil counts were essentially the same in the two groups at 24 and 72 hours post-injury.</s>
          <s>Outside of only a transient decrease in BUN at 24 hours in the TXA treatment group, there were not other laboratory or histologic changes suggesting renal changes associated with TXA treatment.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In this study, TXA administration was associated with increased myocardial necrosis and degeneration as well as inflammatory cell infiltration.</s>
          <s>Myocardial infarction is an infrequent but noted potential complication of TXA <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It is therefore possible that our results are associated with its anti-fibrinolytic properties.</s>
          <s>With regard to the increased myocardial infiltrate seen with TXA administration, an association between lymphocytic myocardial infiltration and myocardial infarction has been found in a study of human hearts at autopsy <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Despite these histologic findings, however, a difference in CK levels between the two treatment groups was not demonstrated.</s>
          <s>Thus, while histologically evident, a physiologically relevant degree of myocardial degeneration and necrosis is not supported by the laboratory data from this rat model.</s>
          <s>Troponin testing may have been a more sensitive clinic marker for myocardial ischemia compared to CK for this study.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Interestingly, in the CRASH-2 trial, patients that were administered TXA had a lower incidence of post-traumatic myocardial infarction compared to those that did not receive the drug <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Likewise, in the MATTERs study, TXA was not found to be an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, high dose TXA has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of seizures in cardiac surgery patients <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">37]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Given these disparate findings, more information is needed regarding potential adverse effects associated with widespread administration of TXA in trauma patients.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There are several limitations present in this study.</s>
          <s>Pre-designated euthanasia endpoints were established.</s>
          <s>It was therefore not possible to determine if TXA was associated with a mortality difference.</s>
          <s>Coagulation parameters were not evaluated, although this was not the focus of this study.</s>
          <s>Thus, it is certainly possible that the potential benefits of TXA may be directly related to its anti-fibrinolytic effects.</s>
          <s>Compared to other rodent studies, a larger dose of TXA was used in this study-the maximum allowable dose without known adverse effects.</s>
          <s>Future studies evaluating TXA on inflammation in larger animal models as well as if delayed administration influences the inflammatory profile will further develop our understanding on the immunomodulatory effects of TXA in trauma.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that TXA is associated with an overall suppressive effect on a few key inflammatory mediators in a rodent model of controlled HS.</s>
          <s>In addition, while TXA treatment was associated with reduced pulmonary edema and mesenteric lymph node follicular hyperplasia, it was also associated with increased myocardial degeneration, which is potentially related to the pro-thrombotic effect of TXA.</s>
          <s>Further studies are needed to better understand which patients may be at most risk for adverse effects of TXA and which patients may benefit the most from the potential immunomodulatory as well as the anti-fibrinolytic effects of TXA in trauma.</s>
