          <s>By introducing a pooled single-gRNA (sgRNA) or paired-gRNA (pgRNA) library into cells expressing Cas9 or catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused with effector domains, investigators can perform multifarious genetic screens by generating diverse mutations, large genomic deletions, transcriptional activation, or transcriptional repression <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>

          <s>To generate a high-quality cell library of gRNAs for any given CRISPR screen, one must use a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) during cell library construction to ensure that the majority of cells harbors one sgRNA/pgRNA to minimize the false-positive discovery rate <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To further reduce the FDR (false discovery rate) and increase data reproducibility, in-depth coverage of gRNAs and multiple biological replicates are often necessary to obtain the hit genes with high statistical significance <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[12]</ref> , resulting in increased library size.</s>
          <s>Additional difficulties may arise when one performs a large number of genome-wide screens, when the cell materials for library construction are limited, or when one conducts more challenging screens (i.e., in vivo) for which it is difficult to arrange the experimental replications or control the MOI.</s>
          <s>To address these technical difficulties, we aimed to design a novel method that enabled us to use a high MOI to generate CRISPR libraries in target cells and to obtain improved statistics for the screening results.</s>
          <s>We hypothesized that both the false-positive and false-negative rates of high MOI screens could be drastically reduced if we had more experimental replicates for each of the gRNAs.</s>
          <s>If we assigned the gRNAs different barcodes that were somehow embedded within the gRNA sequences, we could then trace the performance of each gRNA multiple times within the same experiment by counting both the gRNAs and their internal barcode (iBAR) sequences.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Two papers have recently reported methods to generate random barcodes outside the sgRNA body for pooled CRISPR screening <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14,</ref>

          <s>Assuming each sgRNA would create both desired loss-of-function (LOF) and non-LOF alleles, calculating all reads of any given sgRNA is unable to accurately assess the importance of its targeting gene in negative screening.</s>
          <s>Much improved statistical results could be achieved by linking one UMI (unique molecular identifier) with one editing outcome of each sgRNA to enable single-cell lineage tracing so as to lower the false-negative rate <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[14]</ref> , or by counting the decreased number of RSLs (random sequence labels) affiliated with sgRNAs to improve screening quality <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Different from these two methods, we aimed to develop a method through embedded iBARs to enable pooled screening with CRISPR library made of viral infection at a high MOI, so as to reduce library size and improve data quality.</s>

          <s>Ideally, the embedded iBAR should not affect the efficiency of the gRNA in guiding the Cas9 or dCas9 nuclease to the target site.</s>
          <s>We decided to place the barcode sequence in the tetra loop of the gRNA scaffold outside of the Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex, which has been subjected to frequent alterations for various purposes maintaining enough activity of its upstream guide sequence <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We arbitrarily designed a 6-nt-long iBAR (iBAR 6 ) that gave rise to 4096 barcode combinations, providing sufficient variation for our purposes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref> .</s>
          <s>To determine whether the insertions of these extra iBAR sequences affected the gRNA activities, we constructed a library of a pre-determined sgRNA targeting the anthrax toxin receptor gene ANTXR1 <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> in combination with all 4096 types of iBAR <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> .</s>
          <s>This special sgRNA iBAR-ANTXR1 library was constructed in HeLa cells that constantly express Cas9 <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> through lentiviral transduction at a low MOI of 0.3.</s>
          <s cert="0.924072802066803" id="dataset-1" type="Tabular data">After three rounds of PA/LFnDTA toxin treatment and enrichment, the sgRNA along with its iBAR 6 sequences from toxin-resistant cells were examined through NGS analysis as previously reported <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The majority of sgRNAs i-BAR-ANTXR1 and the sgRNAs ANTXR1 without barcodes were significantly enriched, whereas almost all the non-targeting control sgRNAs were absent in the resistant cell populations.</s>
          <s>Importantly, the enrichment levels of sgRNAs iBAR-ANTXR1 with different iBAR 6 s appeared to be random between two biological replicates <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>After calculating the nucleotide frequency at each position of iBAR 6 , we failed to observe any bias of nucleotides from either of the replicates <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Additionally, the GC contents in iBAR 6 did not seem to affect the sgRNA cutting efficiency (Additional file 1: <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>However, there was a small number of iBAR 6 s whose affiliated sgRNA ANTXR1 did not perform well in either screening replicate (Additional file 2: <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> ).</s>
          <s>To rule out the possibility that these iBAR 6 s had negative effects on sgRNA activity, we selected six different iBARs from the bottom of the sgRNA iBAR-ANTXR1 ranking for further investigation.</s>
          <s>Compared to the control sgRNA ANTXR1 without a barcode, all six of these sgRNAs iBAR-ANTXR1 showed comparable efficiency in generating both DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at target sites <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref> and ANTXR1 gene disruption leading to the toxin resistance phenotype <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1e)</ref> .</s>
          <s>We further confirmed the negligible effects of iBARs on sgRNA efficiency by four different sgRNAs targeting CSPG4, MLH1, and MSH2, respectively (Additional file 1: <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Taken together, these results indicate that this re-designed sgRNA iBAR retains sufficient activity of sgRNA, making it possible to generally apply this strategy in CRISPR-pooled screens.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Based on the iBAR strategy, we then set out to broaden its application to perform a novel sgRNA iBAR library screen at a high MOI.</s>
          <s>We followed the standard procedure to harvest the library cells, extract their genomic DNA for PCR amplification of sgRNA with iBAR coding regions, and perform NGS analysis <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>The MAGeCK algorithm could be used to calculate the statistical significance of an sgRNA score through normalization of its raw counts, estimation of its variance using a negative binomial (NB) model, and determination of its ranking using a null model with a uniform distribution <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Taking the iBAR into consideration, we assessed the consistency of any sgRNA count change among all the associated iBARs within the same experimental replicate.</s>
          <s>This process effectively eliminates free riders that were associated with functional sgRNAs due to lentiviral infection at a high MOI in cell library construction.</s>
          <s>Specifically, for the iBAR system, we purposely adjusted the model-estimated variance for only those sgRNAs whose fold changes with multiple iBARs were in opposite directions, resulting in increased P values for these outliers.</s>
          <s>Finally, we identified hit genes based on sgRNA scores and technical variance between biological replicates ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> and "Methods" section).</s>
          <s>We developed this specific MAGeCK-based algorithm named MAGeCK iBAR for the analysis of gRNA i-BAR library screening that is open source and freely available for download ("Methods" section).</s>

          <s>We have previously reported the first identification of the functional receptor of TcdB, CSPG4 <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[20]</ref> , whose coding gene was also identified and ranked at the very top from a genome-scale CRISPR library screening <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In this reported CRISPR screening, UGP2 gene was also top-ranked hit, and FZD2 was identified and confirmed to encode the secondary receptor that mediates the TcdB's killing effect on host cells.</s>
          <s>Of note, the role of FZD2 was significantly dwarfed by CSPG4 so that the FZD2 gene could only be identified using the truncated TcdB that had CSPG4-interacting region deleted <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In our screens on TcdB, we used MAGeCK iBAR (Additional file 2: <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> ) and MAGeCK (Additional file 3: <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> ) to analyze data from iBAR and the conventional CRISPR screens, respectively.</s>
          <s>We consequently obtained top-ranked genes (FDR &lt; 0.15) from both.</s>
          <s>For screening at a low MOI of 0.3, CSPG4 and UGP2 were identified and ranked at the top <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref> , consistent with the previous report <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>When taking iBARs into account, we identified FZD2 in addition to CSPG4 and UGP2 <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Because FZD2 is a proven receptor of TcdB which plays much weaker role than CSPG4 in HeLa cells <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> , these results demonstrated that iBAR method offered superior quality and sensitivity to conventional CRISPR screening when constructing cell library at a low MOI.</s>
          <s>In addition, rankings of CSPG4 and UGP2 were far more consistent in CRISPR iBAR screening between two experimental replicates, again indicating the much higher quality for the new method ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 3a, b)</ref> .</s>
          <s>At high MOIs (3 and 10), CSPG4 and UGP2 could be isolated from both CRISPR and CRISPR iBAR screens, but the data quality was significantly higher with the latter <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3c-f</ref> ).</s>

          <s>The variance of sgRNA iBAR was determined based on the fold change consistency of all iBARs assigned to the same sgRNA.</s>
          <s>The P value of each sgRNA iBAR was calculated using the mean and modified variance.</s>

          <s>A lower RRA score corresponded to a stronger enrichment of the hit genes traditional method.</s>
          <s>At a MOI of 10, the number of false-positive hits was drastically increased in the conventional method, but not in CRISPR iBAR screening <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3e, f )</ref> .</s>
          <s>Impressively, CSPG4 and UGP2 remained top ranked from CRISPR iBAR screening even at an MOI of 10, although the data quality slightly declined <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3f)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Noticeably, nearly all CSPG4-and UGP2-targeting sgRNAs iBAR were significantly enriched after TcdB treatment (Additional file 1: <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure S4</ref> ), strikingly different from other genes identified at an MOI of 10 using conventional method, such as SPPL3, a likely false-positive result (Additional file 1: <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">Figure S4</ref> ).</s>
          <s>In comparison of the two biological replicates, CSPG4 and UGP2 were all ranked at the top in both biological replicates from CRISPR iBAR screens with all MOI conditions <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3b</ref> , d, f ), but not from the conventional CRISPR screens where UGP2 was ranked lower than 60th in both replicates at an MOI of 3 ( <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref> ) and many false-positive hits appeared in both replicates at an MOI of 10 <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 3e)</ref> .</s>
          <s>These results showed that iBAR method maintained the quality of data even at a high MOI as that at a low MOI for conventional CRISPR screening.</s>

          <s>Suppose for one gene there are n sgRNAs with different iBARs in the library of M sgRNAs iBAR in total; every sgRNA iBAR has a rank in the library of R = (R 1 , R 2 , … , R n ).</s>
          <s>First, the ranks of sgRNAs iBAR should be normalized by the total number of sgRNAs iBAR in the library.</s>

          <s>Then, we calculated the sorted normalized ranking sr, making sr 1 ≤ sr 2 ≤ … ≤ sr n .</s>
          <s>The sorted normalized rank follows a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.</s>
          <s>The probability β k, n (sr) in which sr i ≤ r i follows a β distribution β(k, n + 1 − k), making ρ = min(β 1, n , β 2, n , … , β n, n ).</s>
          <s>For every gene, the ρ score can be obtained by RRA and further adjusted by Bonferroni correction <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We adopted MAGeCK, which developed α-RRA, to select the top α% sgRNAs from the ranking list.</s>
          <s>The P values of sgRNAs lower than a threshold (0.25 for instance) were selected.</s>
          <s>Only the top sgRNAs of one gene were considered in the RRA calculation, thus making ρ = min(β 1, n , β 2, n , … , β j, n ), in which 1 ≤ j ≤ n.</s>

          <s>During the analyzing process of positive screening at high MOI based on the iBAR strategy, we modified the model-estimated variance of sgRNAs with different fold change directions among corresponding barcodes.</s>
          <s>But for negative screening, most of the non-functional sgRNAs would be unchanged.</s>
          <s>So the variance modification algorithm based on fold change directions of corresponding barcodes becomes not sufficient to justify weather certain sgRNA is a false-positive result.</s>
          <s>Therefore, we treated barcodes as internal replicates directly.</s>
          <s>When taking iBAR into consideration, we performed two times robust rank aggregation for the negative screening rather than variance adjustment for the inconsistent sgRNAs iBAR .</s>
          <s>The first round of robust rank aggregation aggregates the sgRNA iBAR level to sgRNA level, and the second round aggregates the sgRNA level to gene level.</s>
