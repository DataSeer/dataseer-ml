          <s>An EVD outbreak in West Africa which was detected in March 2014 prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a "public health emergency of international concern" <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the WHO there were ultimately more than 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths in the course of the West African Ebola outbreak <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Humans become infected with EVD by coming into direct contact with infected human bodily fluids, or the bodily fluids or organs of infected bush animals such as bats, monkeys and chimpanzees <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Sierra Leone which was also heavily affected <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> by the West African EVD outbreak recorded its first case in May 2014 <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Most studies relating to the clinical and epidemiological features of EVD at the time of the West African outbreak focused on adult EVD patients.</s>

          <s>Mostly biased by the WHO case definition for a suspected Ebola case, the majority of the patients affected in Sierra Leone by the West African outbreak like others in previous ones were characterized by fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, kidney, liver function failure, sometimes bleeding (although to a lesser extent than previously known), and an incubation period of 2-21 days (median, 14 days) <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There have been conflicting reports about the effects of EVD on children during EVD outbreaks.</s>
          <s>McElroy AK, et al. reported a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 100% (for children EVD cases for whom serum were available), and 28.6% for children &lt; 5 years and 6-15 years respectively for the 2000-2001 EVD outbreak in Gulu district, Uganda <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Peacock et al. reported data for children EVD cases from different outbreaks <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[16]</ref> which tend to suggests that the proportion of EVD infected children varies for different settings and over time.</s>
          <s>There were more (79.0%)</s>
          <s>paediatric EVD cases compared to EVD cases belonging to the age group of 15 years and above during the 2000-2001 EVD outbreak in Uganda <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Leligdowicz A et al. however reported a lower (19%) EVD cases for children compared to cases 15 years and above for the 2014-2016 West African EVD outbreak <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Also, the proportion of children involved in the 1995 EVD outbreak in Zaire was 27/315 (9%), 90/218 (41%) for the 2000-2001 Sudan strain EVD outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, and 147/823 (18%) for the 4 most affected countries in the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>

          <s>Skrips LA, et al. attributed the high incidence of paediatric EVD cases to the less restriction of contact by children coupled with their limited or non-existent understanding of the mechanisms of EVD transmission dynamics <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Athena P and colleagues however attributed the small percentage of global EVD cases for children to cultural practices <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In spite of claims that children had reduced risks of infection as compared to adults <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[19,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23]</ref> in previous EVD outbreaks, and that paediatric EVD cases were underreported during the 2014-2016 West African EVD outbreak <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">24]</ref> , the West African EVD outbreak recorded a high CFR in children younger than 5 years <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Cumulative CFR for the West African EVD outbreak varies but was approximated at 40% <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> with young children and older adults having the highest CFRs <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>There are reports of disproportionate CFRs among children affected by the 2014-2016 West African outbreak <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[9,</ref>
            <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">26]</ref> .</s>

          <s>One Ugandan study involving 55 confirmed EVD cases infected with Sudan Virus Ebola strain reported a high survival rate for children compared to adult <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Clinical data and studies on paediatric EVD treatment outcomes relating to the West African EVD outbreak are scarce, often with small sample sizes <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[25]</ref> and largely focused on reported symptoms by EVD patients on arrival for admission <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>

          <s>For previous EVD studies, the number of paediatric EVD patients in a cohort investigated ranges between 20 and 55 laboratory-confirmed EVD cases <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">23]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Kourtis A. P et al <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref> argued that the fewer studies involving paediatric EVD cases can be attributed to the fact that less number of children become infected with EVD compared to adults due to their lower risk of exposure to EVD which includes caring for EVD sick patients-either in a healthcare setting or at home, and or handling the remains of persons who have died of EVD.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The CFR in EVD in neonates is generally higher than in children in other age groups.</s>
          <s>All neonates born to previously infected EVD mothers died within 19 days after birth during the 1976 outbreak in Zaire <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> and subsequent outbreaks have also confirmed such observations <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is no approved EVD treatment or vaccine against EVD <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30]</ref> but supportive care and management by intravenous fluids intake proved to be crucial for EVD patient survival during the 2014-2016 outbreak <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However currently there are series of experimental therapies and vaccines including brincidofovir <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref> , ZMapp <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[18]</ref> , TKM 130803 <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref> , Favipiravir <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref> , the monoclonal antibody MAb114 <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref> , and convalescent plasma of EVD patients <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref> that has been approved by the WHO for use during outbreaks on compassionate ground.</s>

          <s>We reported that slightly more females were infected with EVD compared to males and that EVD cases below 5 years of age, as well as those cases that reported difficulty in breathing, difficulty in swallowing, signs of conjunctivitis and those with Stage 3 EVD infection at the time of admission recorded higher CFRs compared to the other paediatric EVD cases without these criteria.</s>
          <s>Additionally, we observed that male paediatric EVD patients, paediatric EVD patient who reported abdominal pain, difficulty in breathing, vomiting and showed signs of conjunctivitis at the time of admission tended to have increased odds of dying during EVD treatment.</s>
          <s>Our model suggests an adapted set of criteria for case definitions that would allow a differentiated approach to clinical management that can be assumed to be beneficial to a subgroup of paediatric patients at high risk of dying in the course of treatment.</s>
          <s>We are also suggesting the formulation of a separate paediatric EVD case definition to handle the dissimilarities in CFRs and clinical symptoms between childhood EVD cases and adult EVD cases and to facilitate discrimination from other childhood diseases that have similar clinical symptoms like those of paediatric EVD.</s>
