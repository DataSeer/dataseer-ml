        <p>
          <s>Gun control literature has attempted to quantify effects of gun regulation on crime rates, both within the United States <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> and around the world <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>While this literature can inform gun control policies, it is also important to quantify information diffusion, interests, and emotions <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> to inform those policies <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Associated types of gun-related violence, which is more prevalent in the United States than in high-income countries <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> , have also been thoroughly explored <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Scientific debate around benefits of gun control is as controversial as societal debate <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> , with studies that support less stringent regulations <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> being immediately met with fierce peer-based rejections <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref>
            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Internet searches provide a readily-accessible form of information about public opinion and interest, which could impact public health issues <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14,</ref>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15]</ref> and inform health policies <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16,</ref>
            <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This study aims to provide insights about relationships governing information diffusion and interests around topics of violent attacks, gun control, and gun ownership in the United States <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>A shock is an unexpected alteration of a factor/variable of interest above its regular/steady levels, such as an increase in online searches about violent attacks that occurs concurrent with the actual violent attacks.</s>
          <s>The focus of this work is to assess the impact of shocks in interest about violent attacks on the information-seeking patterns about gun control and purchase.</s>
          <s>This will help identify impulse-response functions of the U.S. population to informational shocks regarding violent attacks, and also to assess the by-product impact of gun control debate on gun purchase interest.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Mass shootings' impact on gun control and gun ownership debates oversize their relative importance, leading to more policy responses than other types of violence <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Interestingly, these policy responses have been more likely to reduce gun control in Republican-led legislatures and provided no impact in Democrat-led legislatures <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref> .</s>
          <s>From a societal perspective, the literature on gun control has been prolific, across research perspectives, to report the potential benefits of enhanced gun control regulation <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[21]</ref>
            <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[22]</ref>
            <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[23]</ref> , though with noted exceptions about its potential widespread benefits <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[24]</ref> .</s>
          <s>From an individual perspective, blame around mass shootings is oftentimes defined by the individual's preconception around the gun control debate and actual firearm possession <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[25]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Media and social media, as key tunneling methods for the debate, have oftentimes led to polarization and entrenched ideological beliefs <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[26,</ref>
            <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">27]</ref> , rather than promoting a natural societal reaction to explore viable common grounds <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[28,</ref>
            <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">29]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Anxiety driven by mass shootings oftentimes focuses the blame on guns across the ideological spectrum, offering an opportunity for policy change <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In contrast, gun ownership interest spikes after mass shootings <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This dual reaction points to the possibility that, while reactive societal interest around gun control may occur as a consequence of mass shootings, the synchronous impact of both events (mass shootings and gun control debate) leads to increased interests in gun ownership.</s>
          <s>While gun control debate has been theorized to be potentially and practically ineffective <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[31]</ref> , statistically disentangling whether it is the mass shooting event or the oftentimes-concurrent gun control debate that drives this increased interest in gun ownership is a necessary step to understanding how societal advancements can occur.</s>
          <s>The main contribution of this manuscript is the extraction of the cross-factor causal impact among the factors of interest (informational interest about mass shootings, gun control, and gun ownership).</s>
          <s>This approach differs from previous research in that it is not descriptive in nature to demonstrate the potential (in)effectiveness of gun control debates or policies over time in the U.S., but inferential in showing that it is actually the current form of the gun control debate that may be causing increased gun ownership interest.</s>

          <s>Google Trends is used to inform a time series model about societal information-seeking behaviors around gun-related violence from the perspectives of policy changes <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[32]</ref> and selfdefense, in which gun control and gun purchase serve as proxies to behaviors and preferences for these two factors <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33]</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[34]</ref>
            <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This approach, which is commonly used in econometrics, but relatively novel to public health analytics, explores potential causal relationships, in which shocks in internet searches about recent episodes of violence could induce shocks in gun control interest, and then shocks in the previous two factors could induce shocks in gun purchase interest.</s>

          <s>Since these factors are not directly observable without explicit disclosure (they are at most measurable through self-declaration, but impossible to extract retrospectively over long periods of time), internet searches about these topics were used as observable proxies for the historical interest levels at the population level.</s>

          <s>However, prepositions and articles are relevant, so search terms were defined as the minimum possible intersection of words in a common search (for example, Buy Gun includes searches such as How to Buy a Gun and Where to Buy a Gun).</s>
          <s>Plural versus singular forms of a word are also relevant, so both Shooting and Shootings were included, since they may reflect not only the nature of the violent attacks (single location versus potential multiple locations), but also intertemporal concerns (single shooting versus a perceived shooting spree).</s>

          <s>This is the first study, to our knowledge, that uses internet searches as a proxy for interest in, and measurement of, intertemporal causal relationships between interest in violent attacks, gun control, and gun purchase at a population level.</s>
          <s>Results from the impulse-response functions show that a surge in interest about violent attacks induced subsequent surges in interest about gun control and gun purchase, but with a higher longer-term impact on gun control interest and much more subdued and non-significant impact on gun purchase interest.</s>
          <s>However, results show that heightened gun control interest appears to cause significant and lasting increases in gun purchase interest.</s>
          <s>Public interest in violent attacks can spark interest in selfprotection in different forms, although evidence found in surveys about viewpoint changes related to specific events is limited <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">[56]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Among possible reactions, two antagonistic options are the search for individual protection (gun purchase) and societal protection (gun control).</s>
          <s>Additionally, gun control debate can spark fears in those who understand it not only as a threatened second amendment right, but also as a necessary means for self-protection.</s>
          <s>The time series SVAR model accounts for these contemporaneous causal relationships; and, population-based variations in interest were explored through Google searches around key search terms that reflect these societal actions and fears.</s>
          <s>Results show that there are strong relationships between shocks in information interest about violent attacks and reactive interest about gun control, but also that shocks in interest regarding gun control tend to have the opposite intended effect on gun purchase interest, enhancing it rather than taming it.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Since internet searches imply a perceived lack of sufficient knowledge about the topic, yet interest in it, it is important to note that the impact on gun purchase interest by gun control interest may be higher than observed.</s>
          <s>Individuals who do not need to conduct a search about gun purchase, either because they already own firearms or already know how to purchase them, would be less likely to be included amongst our data.</s>
          <s>Since individuals were not sampled at random in this analysis, it would be reasonable to consider those who own a gun, or possibly those who have knowledge of how to purchase one, as a subpopulation of those more likely to be against gun control (or at least some degree of it).</s>

          <s>Finally, the impulse-response functions facilitate understanding the causal relationships and temporal length of the impact of shocks in each of the variables.</s>
