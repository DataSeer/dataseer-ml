        <head>Background</head>
        <p>
          <s>Over the past few decades, migration has become a key feature of our increasingly interconnected and globalised world.</s>
          <s>According to the United Nations, the number of international migrants worldwide has increased from 76 million people in 1960 to 232 million people in 2013 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>International migration can be divided into four types based on the country of origin and host country.</s>
          <s>Although most attention is on the movement of people from developing countries to developed countries, the second-largest flow of people is between developing countries, so called South-to-South migration <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> .</s>
          <s>According to the 2017 International Migrant Report, Asia now receives more international migrants (80 million) than Europe (78 million) or North America (58 million) <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>In recent years, China has become a new destination for international migration because of its rapid economic development <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2013, it was estimated that about 848,500 foreigners lived in China, with an average annual growth rate of 3.9% <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As the paragon of China's economic reform and a major trading port of southern China, the city of Guangzhou in Guangdong province has attracted a large number of international migrants from both developed and developing countries <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In 2017, the number of foreigners living in Guangzhou was estimated to be 88,000 <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>This large-scale inflow of international visitors to Guangzhou has not only boosted the local economic prosperity of the city and reformed the social and cultural landscape but also created challenges, including health-related issues <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Although it is often reported that the majority of international migrants are relatively young and healthy, this assertion should be reassessed given a significant increasing trend in chronic diseases among young and middle-aged populations worldwide, including in developing countries <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> , along with a relatively high prevalence of infectious diseases (e.g.</s>
          <s>HIV and neglected tropical diseases) among international migrants from certain regions <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, because international migrants often encounter challenges such as language barriers, economic difficulties, and lack of access to health services in the process of adapting to the foreign environment <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>
            <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> in addition to cultural conflicts and racial discrimination, they tend to become more vulnerable than the locals to other mental and physical ailments <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13,</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">14]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>A study in the US reported that compared with the local population, international migrants have lower mortality rates and are less likely to suffer from circulatory diseases, obesity and some cancers <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> .</s>
          <s>However, one systematic review from Europe reported that international migrants are more likely than non-migrants to self-rate their health status as poor <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Thus, the findings from literature are inconsistent with regard to study populations and health outcomes <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, migration-related factors, such as language barriers, economic status, cultural differences and legal status, have been reported to be associated with the health status of and health service utilisation among international migrants <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>
            <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>
            <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Most of the current research on international migrants has been conducted in developed countries, and therefore, the findings are not applicable to South-to-South migrants <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Furthermore, in most China-related studies on international migrants, China has been presented as an exporting country.</s>
          <s>However, in recent years, as China is receiving increasing number of foreigners <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> , it is important to understand the migrants' demographic characteristics, health status and health-seeking behaviour to build a resilient health system.</s>
          <s>Research concerning such issues in China is very limited <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>In addition, almost all of the few studies available on South-to-South migrants to China are qualitative and specific to African migrants and their low utilisation of community health services <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> or their dissatisfaction with access to health care and health services <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref>
            <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>
            <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>There is a lack of quantitative evidence on the health status of international migrants in China and their access to health services.</s>
          <s>This is critical given that the country of origin is considered as an important determinant in explaining the differences in the health status of and health service utilisation among migrant population <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27,</ref>
            <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">28]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To help fill this gap, the present study aimed to quantitatively assess the key demographic and health service access characteristics of international migrants to China by the income level of their country of origin <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[29]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, it is one of the few studies focusing on the characteristics and health-related perceptions of international migrants coming from high-, middleand low-income countries (HICs, MICs and LICs, respectively) to a developing country.</s>
          <s>We hope that this study will initiate a national debate on the development of policies for international migrants and prepare the health system for the challenges presented by an increasingly mobile global population.</s>

          <s>The participants in this study were adult foreign visitors (age: 18 years or above) who visited the Guangzhou Municipal Exit-Entry Administration Office to extend their visa during January 2016.</s>
          <s>China grants permanent residency to a small number of foreigners (0.06%) <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[30]</ref> compared with other prominent countries that grant it to about 10% of foreigners.</s>
          <s>Therefore, most foreign visitors in Guangzhou who desire a long-term residence must go through a lengthy visa extension process <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[31]</ref> at the Guangzhou Municipal Exit-Entry Administration Office.</s>

          <s>The survey was also available in 13 languages and did not contain any identifiable information, such as name or passport number.</s>
          <s>After completion of the survey, the participants were provided a small gift (postcards) for participation.</s>

          <s>This was the first quantitative study on the various characteristics and health-related perceptions of international migrants coming to China from HICs, MICs and LICs.</s>
          <s>The findings demonstrated that the majority of international migrants in Guangzhou came from MICs and LICs (75%).</s>
          <s>Although participants from the HIC group visited Guangzhou more frequently, those from the LIC group had longer stay.</s>
          <s>In addition, although a large proportion of the participants (89.6%) considered themselves to be in good health, one fifth of the participants had experienced health problems while staying in China and about half did not have health insurance.</s>
          <s>The results highlight potential gaps between the health care needs and the health care coverage of international migrants in China.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Migrants in China come from several countries.</s>
          <s cert="0.9148815870285034" id="dataset-5" type="Tabular data">Over the 31 days of this studies, we recorded a very diverse group of migrants coming from 119 countries.</s>
          <s>Our finding highlighted the diversity of international migrants' backgrounds in terms of countries of origin, languages, culture and religions.</s>
          <s>Such diverse backgrounds pose a challenge to the local health care system in coping with distinctive health needs and different expectations.</s>
          <s>The results of a US survey suggest that resources should be allocated to provide basic interpretation services to migrants in primary care and preventive health service centres <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[32]</ref> , but such services are still absent in China.</s>
          <s>About half of the participants had a Chinese name (47%) as many had an education experience in China (41.5%) or had an ongoing job in China (60.3%).</s>
          <s>Our findings also revealed that a significant proportion of migrants (about one third) came to China very frequently (more than 10 times).</s>
          <s>With such a high frequency of international mobility, the international migrants are more likely to be exposed to individual, social and environmental risks to health <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[33,</ref>
            <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">34]</ref> , which may subsequently increase their vulnerability to health problems <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[35,</ref>
            <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">36]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Moreover, such high mobility could lead to potential risks of disease transmission.</s>
          <s>For example, both SARS and Zika viruses that recently caused outbreaks of contagious diseases in China and South America were originally carried by international migrants during their trips and led to transmission in local areas <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[37]</ref>
            <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[38]</ref>
            <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[39]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, it is important to strengthen the border surveillance and screening of infectious diseases among international migrants as well as multi-national cooperation on information exchange, joint investigation and health care policies to control pandemics <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[40]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Furthermore, one fifth of the participants reported to have experienced health issues while staying in China, while about half of the participants did not have medical insurance (especially those from LICs), and about 60% of the participants only knew little or no mandarin.</s>
          <s>This finding suggests the needs for offering effective medical services; for example, basic medical services with translators will be critical to meet the basic acute health care needs of international migrants, especially of those without health insurance.</s>
          <s>Reportedly, unfamiliarity with the health service process and lack of patient-physician language concordance are the primary difficulties faced by foreign residents seeking medical care in China <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, providing language assistance in clinics and leaflets with clear guidance and instructions of local health services (e.g.</s>
          <s>hospital address, standard procedure of seeing a doctor and average expenditure of seeing a doctor) in different languages may be helpful for foreign residents.</s>
          <s>For migrants with medical insurance, as the insurance itself does not ensure the use of health services, future studies investigating whether migrants who had medical insurance knew how to use it, whether they used it when in need, and what barriers they faced during the process are also warranted.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The findings further revealed that the income levels of the participants' country of origin were independent factors affecting their health status, health insurance and perceptions of health services in China.</s>
          <s>Participants from HICs were more likely to have health problems, whereas those from LICs were more likely to report improved health status.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, 43% of the participants gave positive feedback regarding China's health service.</s>
          <s>This percentage is lower than the percentages in a previous study on Chinese local residents, 76.5 and 67.2% of whom reported being satisfied with outpatient and inpatient services, respectively <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[41]</ref> .</s>
          <s>International migration status of the migrants contributes to the difficulties faced by them in seeking and using health services.</s>
          <s>Because of the limited health care resources and current intense patientphysician relationship in China <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[42]</ref> , innovative measures will be required to provide effective health services to foreign residents; different community resources (e.g.</s>
          <s>community clinics, NGOs providing services for foreigners and volunteers) could be explored, and different services could be integrated.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>Health equity and a universal health care coverage were hailed as the principles of the Chinese health system in the 'Belt and Road High Level Meeting for Health Cooperation' held in Beijing in 2017 <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>
          <s>To promote health equity, the health needs of international migrants should be considered for developing health policies and reforming the health care system given the large number of migrants.</s>
          <s>In the current context of globalisation and the continuing growth of China's economy, more international migrants in China can be expected, and it will undoubtedly warrant a reform of the local health system to adapt to the multi-cultural reality.</s>
          <s>Such reform will indeed play a positive role in strengthening health diplomacy between China and other partner countries and expand China's contribution to global health development <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[44,</ref>
            <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">45]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, our findings regarding the diverse backgrounds of international migrants in Guangzhou (Guangdong Province), including the 119 countries of origin, the languages they used, and the different socio-economic Variables that were non-significant in univariate logistic regression models of all outcome variables were not listed in the table, namely currently has a job in China, number of years since the first visit to China, and number of fellow townsmen one knew in Guangzhou --: Variables that were non-significant in univariate logistic regression models.</s>

          <s>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with p &lt; 0.05 are presented in bold background, will be the beginning of the understanding of the demands on the health care system.</s>
          <s>Due to the 'Belt and Road' strategy and 'South-South collaboration' , more international migrants in China are expected in future.</s>
          <s>More future studies should be conducted to explore the health issues faced by international migrants and to develop pilot innovative interventions to meet their health needs and the requirement for pandemic surveillance.</s>

Second, because the study period (January) was right after the Christmas holidays, during the winter holidays for Chinese universities, and before the Chinese New Year, it is likely that many foreigners may have left China for their home countries; therefore, in other months of the year, there could be more international migrants. Thus, caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to the entire international migrant population of China. Third, although confidentiality and privacy were guaranteed during the survey process, reporting bias may still exist as all data were self-reported under the circumstances. Finally, the cross-sectional study design limited the causal inference, and the relationships between variables could only be explained as associations. Despite these limitations, our study provided the first "snapshot" of the health status and health care service perceptions of international migrants in China. It is important for China to understand the key health problems of different export countries to better cope with the diverse health needs of different migrants.</figDesc>
