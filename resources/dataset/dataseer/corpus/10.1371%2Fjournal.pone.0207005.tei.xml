          <s>Populations are ageing across the world due to rising life expectancy and falling fertility rates, which has led to the adoption of the first Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Ageing and Health by the World Health Assembly in 2016 <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, the number of people living with HIV aged 50 years and over (PLHIV50+) is increasing <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>

          <s>Some of these acquired HIV when they were aged less than 50 years and were treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), while others acquired HIV when 50 years or older.</s>
          <s>For a successful HIV response, the number of people acquiring HIV and the number of people dying of AIDS should both decline.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Evidence suggests that PLHIV develop non-HIV health conditions at an earlier age than people not living with HIV, <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>

          <s>Apart from HIV infection and long-term ART, this accelerated and accentuated ageing can be due to other factors, including socio-economic and lifestyle factors such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol intake and poor nutrition.</s>
          <s>For women living with HIV, this includes health conditions related to menopause and reduced bone density <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>

          <s>However, such data are still scarce in countries with high HIV prevalence; data collection in populationbased household surveys have mostly focused on 15-49 year old persons and on pregnant women attending antenatal clinic facilities.</s>

          <s>The aim of this paper is to present the current global and regional HIV burden among PLHIV50+ based on the 2017 UNAIDS estimates that cover the period 2000-2016, to project estimates up to 2020 and to review the treatment and care services, prevention and social services that countries need to develop and implement to cater for their increasing number of PLHIV50+ and to reduce incidence among people aged older than 50 years.</s>

          <s>Using the basic demographic input in the model, the AIDS Impact Module within Spectrum is further informed by HIV prevalence data, obtained from sentinel surveillance surveys among women attending antenatal clinics, surveys among key populations, household surveys that include HIV serostatus, case reporting data, as well as program data on the number of PLHIV reached with ART.</s>

          <s>The AIDS Impact Module is not a deterministic model, so information on interventions do not have an important impact on the incidence estimates as those are derived from the prevalence from surveillance and the ART coverage.</s>
          <s>Incidence is distributed by age and sex for the entire population based on assumptions on incidence rate ratios of the incidence among people 25-29 to all age groups from 15-19 through 80+.</s>

          <s>For low level epidemics with few people who inject drugs the patterns of incidence by age and sex are derived from populationbased household surveys in countries with HIV prevalence less than four percent.</s>

        </p>
        <p>
          <s>The increases are seen among PLHIV50+ that were infected before the age of 50 and those infected after the age of 50.</s>
          <s>The greater proportion of PLHIV50+ living in LMICs are due to the larger number of PLHIV living in these countries and the global roll-out of ART that has been recently observed <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Currently, a higher proportion of the PLHIV living in HICs are aged older than 50 years, but these proportions are also increasing in LMICs.</s>
          <s>The current difference between HICs and LMICs is not only a reflection of the larger number of PLHIV living in LMICs but also due to the delayed roll-out of ART in LMICs compared with HICs.</s>
          <s>As the roll-out of ART in LMICs continues at a rapid pace, partly attributable due to the 90-90-90 Strategy [34], the number and proportion of PLHIV50+ is likely to continue to increase in LMICs.</s>

          <s>The underlying pathophysiological cause is chronic inflammation by chronic immune activation.</s>

          <s>PLHIV are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease and because of the prevalence of HIV in LMICs, the population attributable fraction for CVD is highest in LMICs, especially in Eastern and Southern Africa <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref> .</s>

        <p>
          <s>The number of PLHIV50+ is increasing worldwide, with the largest numbers observed in LMICs.</s>
          <s>Any person diagnosed with HIV should be started on ART as soon as possible.</s>
          <s>As people in this age group are sexually active, they will also need to be reached through HIV prevention campaigns, and HIV testing and counselling programs.</s>
          <s>Care givers need to be aware of the changing physical, psychological and social needs of ageing in PLHIV50+ and need to ensure optimum psychological and social support where required <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[61,</ref>
            <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">62]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Increased surveillance and patient monitoring need to be focused on PLHIV50+ and agencies reporting HIVtrends should routinely analyze trends occurring in PLHIV50+.</s>
          <s>At country level, HIV and non-HIV services need to be linked more strongly as PLHIV50+ are the group par excellence that will increasingly need the use of non-HIV services.</s>
