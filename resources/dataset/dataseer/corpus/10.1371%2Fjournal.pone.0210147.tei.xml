          <s>Introduction E-cigarettes (ECs) have been described as a potentially disruptive technology that could greatly assist efforts to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and have been shown to deliver nicotine on par with tobacco cigarettes <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Although Abrams <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> has suggested that ECs could make the combusting of tobacco obsolete, he cautioned that additional research is needed to inform science-based policy.</s>
          <s>His cautionary note reflects the fact that currently there is a general lack of scientific data about EC effectiveness and safety.</s>
          <s>As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes that "it is important to evaluate e-cigarettes based on their individual characteristics. . . to learn more about the potential benefits and drawbacks of the products".</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> Systematic evaluation of individual characteristics of commercially available EC devices is complicated by the rapid evolution of EC technology and designs, which is driven largely by the innovations of experienced users in the vaping community and highly adaptive small businesses.</s>
          <s>Although first generation cigarette-like (cigalike or G1) devices are still being marketed, the technology has since advanced to second (G2) and third generation (G3) devices featuring a user refillable e-juice tanks, high capacity batteries, and adjustable power settings.</s>
          <s>G2 and G3 devices are capable of delivering much more power than cigalike ECs, especially when coupled with a low-resistance coil.</s>
          <s>For example, a device with a 1.5 ohm (Ω) coil and 4.2 volts direct current (VDC) battery is expected to deliver 11.8 watts (W) compared to~4 W for an older cigalike device (2.5 Ω, 3.2 VDC).</s>
          <s>These newer devices were also observed to deliver higher plasma nicotine levels than G1 devices <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Recently, the JUUL EC has skyrocketed in popularity (insert JUUL citation here), especially with youth.</s>
          <s>This device has led some to seek a new classification such as fourth generation (G4) since it resembles a USB memory stick more than a cigarette, but it is actually quite similar to G1 ECs in operation.</s>
          <s>JUUL uses a low powered, fixed-voltage battery with only a user-replaceable cartridge/ mouth piece.</s>
          <s>Aside from appearance and use of high concentration nicotine salt solution (~5% or 50 mg/mL) the JUUL is best classified as a successful re-boot of the G1 device class.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>From basic thermodynamic principles it can be deduced that more power applied to the atomizer will produce greater vaporization because more energy is available to overcome the heat of vaporization of the e-juice.</s>
          <s>However, as the wick approaches its maximum flow rate, the energy loss from e-juice evaporation becomes limited and any further power applied to the heating coil will result in higher coil temperature but not necessairly more vaporization.</s>
          <s>Therefore the physical design of an EC atomizer and its operating power can be expected to influence many factors such as temperature, chemical profile and concentration of EC aerosol.</s>
          <s>Indeed, ECs have been shown to reach high coil temperatures.</s>
          <s>One study measured a dry coil temperature at 350˚C <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> , but another measured wetted coil temperatures from 139-231˚C <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref> , and many G3 EC batteries now offer temperature control features in the range of 100-315˚C.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> Propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) are known to pyrolyze in air at high temperature <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7,</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">8]</ref> , though it is uncertain if these coil temperatures are sufficient to induce pyrolysis of PG and VG during vaporization.</s>
          <s>To this point, several researchers have found aldehydes and other carbonyl compounds in EC aerosol, <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref>

            <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>
            <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref> but pyrolysis of PG and VG was best demonstrated to occur during vaporization by Herrington and Myers <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Similarly, Kosmider et al <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> and Sleiman et al <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> found increasing levels of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in EC aerosol of PG, VG, and PG:VG blends at voltages ranging from 3.2 to 4.8 VDC (approximately 4-10 W).</s>

        <p>
          <s>Higher vaping power increases the mass vaporized by the atomizer which subsequently condenses to form the vaping aerosol.</s>
          <s>More mass vaporized translates into a higher mass concentration of EC aerosol but the particle size distribution of said aerosol has yet to be fully characterized.</s>
          <s>Aerosol theory informs that vapor phase e-juice will begin to condense when the atmosphere is super saturated, forming nucleation centers and also condensing on ambient particles inhaled during puffing.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref> Condensation begins immediately after the vapor leaves the hot zone surrounding the atomizer heating element because of the level of supersaturation of e-juice vapor.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Calculating the vapor pressure from Antoine equation constants <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref> and weighting for mole fraction, VG achieves favorable saturation ratio for self-nucleation (&gt;4) with as little as 5.5˚C increase over ambient.</s>
          <s>At 100˚C vaporization temperature and 37˚C inhaled oral conditions, the saturation ratio from a e-juice solution of PG, VG, nicotine and water with mole fractions of 0.29/0.65/0.05/0.01,</s>
          <s>respectively, would be 12.5 (PG), 32,700 (VG), 4.0 (nicotine), and 1.16 (water).</s>
          <s>Clearly, VG has a saturation ratio that is sufficient to initiate ultrafine particle nucleation and continue to drive condensation growth as the EC vapor cools in the mouthpiece and oral cavity.</s>
          <s>As self-nucleated condensation commences, particle count concentration becomes very large very rapidly (10 9 −10 10 ) which causes particles to bump into each other (coagulation) and become larger in diameter.</s>
          <s>Due to the extremely favorable saturation ratios and high count concentrations, particles continue to grow through condensation even while they coagulate.</s>
          <s>As larger particles form (or are introduced through puff air), they act as scavengers for the very small diffusion driven particles (&lt;100 nm) reducing the count concentration of small particles and increasing the mass of large particles which slowly increases their diameter.</s>
          <s>Nucleated condensation and coagulation was characterized by Mikheev et al <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref> where ECs produced bimodal particle size distributions (PSDs) at 12 and 135 nm (cigalike model) which started unimodal for the first 2 seconds at 12 nm then shifted to bimodal at 12 and 135 nm after 2 seconds.</s>
          <s>The mass volatilized is low while atomizer temperature is low, particles form but do not grow large; as the atomizer reaches a higher steady state temperature more mass is volatilized and a second mode emerges.</s>
          <s>Mickeev et al also evaluated a higher powered G2 EC (similar to that used in this study) which produced a bimodal PSD at 20 and 170 nm.</s>
          <s>Mikheev et al recognizes the likelihood of particle evaporation due to the low pressure of the instrument used in that study, but showed dilution had minimal effect on PSD up to 26,500x dilution.</s>

          <s>A study by Brown and Cheng <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref> identifies the lack of information on the relationships between EC power and aerosol physicochemical properties as a "critical information gap" that needs to be addressed in order to evaluate EC safety and effectiveness.</s>

          <s>Ji et al. impinged EC aerosol into a liquid and measured the hydrodynamic diameter by dynamic light scattering.</s>

          <s>The observed shift in vaping aerosol mass distribution toward larger particle sizes from higher power settings was likely due to greater mass of e-juice vaporized, resulting in a greater saturation ratio and more vapor mass available to form primary particles and grow particles.</s>
          <s>This increased the number of primary particles which increased the coagulation rate which led to rapid particle growth and count reduction among the nano-sized particles while inside the puffing syringe (mouth simulation).</s>
          <s>After syringe and bag dilution, the aerosol particle sizes were quite stable as shown in S2 <ref type="figure">Fig.</ref>

          <s>Even in the face of this possibility, our data clearly demonstrate that a substantial fraction (~95%) of the measured aerosol is well above the ranges (10-600 nm) previously measured and reported.</s>

        <head>Limitations</head>
        <p>
          <s>This study has many limitations which should be noted and briefly discussed.</s>
          <s>First this study only examined a single 2G EC with a single e-juice out of hundreds of options currently on the market.</s>
          <s>While it was the objective of this study to observe trends that should be universal to all similar devices, each device and e-juice combination is expected to have unique results.</s>
          <s>The puff regime simulated a "typical" vaping scenario that was very similar to the CORESTA recommended method number 81 for evaluation of electronic cigarettes but the literature shows puff topographies vary across users and across devices.</s>
          <s>Lower puff rate and longer puff duration are expected to result in larger PSDs since the vaporized mass will be less diluted and in closer proximity, but these factors were not assessed in this study.</s>
          <s>The dilution technique utilized was not ideal but was the best that could be accomplished with the available resources at the time of conducting these experiments.</s>
          <s>Conducting puffs into a syringe provided a simple way to simulate one aspect of mouth puffing, but not physiological temperature and relative humidity which are both expected to cause further particle growth by condensation.</s>
          <s>Manually conducting puffs introduced human error into the reproducibility of the results which is why triplicate trials were averaged for the battery powered EC trials and why the lab powered EC trials were conducted over a wide range of powers to show a trend not to make a statistical test.</s>
          <s>The trend is quite apparent that increasing power decreased the nano-sized particles and increased the micron sized particles systematically.</s>

        <head>Conclusions</head>
        <p>
          <s>Based upon the results of the specificly tested EC device, with a single e-juice, puffed at a single flow rate using a simulated mouth puff; vaping aerosol is dynamic and mouth puffed EC aerosol spans a much wider particle size range than previously reported.</s>
          <s>Although the major portion of particle mass is still well within the respirable size range, it is near the upper bound which shifts the primary deposition site to the oro-pharyngeal region instead of the alveoli.</s>
          <s>These results demonstrate the dramatic effect increasing power has on EC aerosol particle concentration and mass distribution across a wide range of particle sizes.</s>
          <s>Because e-cigarette technology has continued to evolve toward higher power devices, and the mass of vaporized ejuice increases with power, there is a great need for further research to inform the design and regulation of e-cigarette products and critical components such as batteries, atomizers and ejuice composition to ensure a safe and reliable vaping experience.</s>

          <s>The primary consideration of these trials were to establish a dilution technique that could be uniformly applied to all test conditions to create a minimally changing aerosol that was dilute enough to measure within the instrument single particle counting range with minimal noise due to dilution correction.</s>
          <s>EC aerosol generated by EC battery at a.) minimum dial setting and b.) maximum dial setting were used for these experiments.</s>
          <s>Dilution with static (bag) and dynamic technique presented less noise than static techniques alone.</s>
          <s>Particle size distribution is left shifted with bag+dynamic dilution which is due to evaporation and prevention of particle agglomeration.</s>
