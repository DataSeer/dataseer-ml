            <s>One gene named imaginal disc growth factor 4 (idgf4) which is involved in cuticle formation, plays an important role in organizing proteins in the chitin-matrix, as well as in adult molting.</s>
            <s>This gene in the poorly-described glycoside hydrolase 18 (GH 18) family was chosen to study the function of chitinases in insect defense barrier against heat and molting using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA interference (RNAi).</s>
            <s>qRT-PCR showed that idgf4 was expressed in all nine developmental stages and was mainly expressed in the early and late pupal, as well as adult stages.</s>

          <s>The poorly described GH 18 family is a key gene family in insect development, with members, such as chitinases, having catalytic activity, as well as some proteins without catalytic activity, such as IDGFs <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">46</ref> .</s>
          <s>We have been interested in one gene idgf4 in this family to study its role in insect defense barrier against heat and other key functions during the development in Tephritid fruit fly species for the first time.</s>
          <s>There are predicted and conserved domains in the idgf4 protein containing the GH 18-IDGF domain, glyco-18 domain (glyco-hydro-18 domain) and Chi A domain <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Two types of the genes with three same domains as same as the phylogenetic tree showed that the genes were highly conserved in the Tephritid fruit flies.</s>

          <s>The expression pattern of idgf4 in different developmental stages indicates that it may play distinct roles during insect growth and development.</s>
          <s>This observation is similar to the previous study in which idgf genes were expressed at rather constant levels throughout larval and pupal development in Drosophila <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>

          <s>The knockdown studies in Drosophila identified idgf genes involved in cuticle molting during the pupal stage, and the gene reduction could cause pupal lethality <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22</ref> .</s>

          <s>Among all the stages, larvae were chosen because they have a strong selection for heat resistance and plasticity as they are exposure to thermal stress inside the fruits <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">45</ref> .</s>
          <s>The inadequate environment of high temperature leads to an increased expression of idgf4 in surviving larvae.</s>
          <s>The increasing expression pattern of this gene might reveal its involvement in heat tolerance.</s>

          <s>The idgf genes also showed a potential function in insect temperature adaptation in desert beetle Microdera punctipennis, in which low temperatures, such as 4 °C and −4 °C could upregulate the expression of six genes, including idgf2, in the GH 18 family <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">48</ref> .</s>
          <s>We showed the same results; that high temperature can upregulate the expression of idgf4 and that silencing this gene can decrease the survival rate under heat stress in B. dorsalis.</s>

          <s>The imperfect development implied that they had weak diffusion and competition ability which led to the loss of flight ability compared to the healthy flies.</s>
          <s>In addition, in all the functional studies, two control groups, including irrelevant dsRNA of GFP and H 2 O without any dsRNA, were used, and no difference were found between these two different control groups.</s>
          <s>No dead or malformed flies in the control groups indicated that the malformed development was related to the idgf4 gene knockdown, not the RNAi methodology itself.</s>

          <s>In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of the idgf4 gene in B. dorsalis was significantly decreased by feeding insects the dsRNA of idgf4.</s>
          <s>Considering its function in the larval and pupal stages, idgf4 can be used as a potential target gene for pest control.</s>
          <s>Although we reduced the expression of this gene in early pupal period, nearly 20% of B. dorsalis were unable to recover, even after 10 days of pupation in our study.</s>
          <s>The irreparability of wings and body size, as well as the highly conserved traits, indicate that idgfs are key genes for pest.</s>

To verify the ORF of idgf4 in B. dorsalis, three pairs of primers were designed based on the conserved regions of the idgf4 from B. oleae, C. capitata, D. melanogaster (sequence from GeneBank) and the sequence of idgf4 from the result of the B. dorsalis transcriptome (No. SRP093863). The primers for cloning and amplification conditions are shown in Tables 1 and S2, respectively. The ORF and con- served domain were identified with the ORF Finder software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) and NCBI BLAST results (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
