          <p>
            <s>We recently identified three novel thioredoxin-like genes in the genome of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium that belong to the Phosducin-like family of proteins (PhLP).</s>
            <s>PhLPs are small cytosolic proteins hypothesized to function in G-protein signaling and protein folding.</s>
            <s>Although PhLPs are highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, only a few representatives have been experimentally characterized to date.</s>
            <s>In addition, while PhLPs contain a thioredoxin domain, they lack a CXXC motif, a strong indicator for redox activity, and it is unclear whether members of the PhLP family are enzymatically active.</s>
            <s>Here, we describe PbPhLP-3 as the first phosducin-like protein of a protozoan organism, Plasmodium berghei.</s>
            <s>Initial transcription analysis revealed continuous low-level expression of pbphlp-3 throughout the complex Plasmodium life cycle.</s>
            <s>Attempts to knockout pbphlp-3 in P. berghei did not yield live parasites, suggesting an essential role for the gene in Plasmodium.</s>
            <s>We cloned, expressed and purified PbPhLP-3 and determined that the recombinant protein is redox active in vitro in a thioredoxin-coupled redox assay.</s>
            <s>It also has the capacity to reduce the organic compound tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in vitro, albeit at low efficiency.</s>
            <s>Sequence analysis, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a conserved cysteine in the thioredoxin domain to be the redox active residue.</s>
            <s>Lastly, we provide evidence that recombinant human PhLP-3 exhibits redox activity similar to that of PbPhLP-3 and suggest that redox activity may be conserved in PhLP-3 homologs of other species.</s>
            <s>Our data provide new insight into the function of PhLP-3, which is hypothesized to act as cochaperones in the folding and regulation of cytoskeletal proteins.</s>
            <s>We discuss the potential implications of PhLP-3 as a thioredoxin-target protein and possible links between the cellular redox network and the eukaryotic protein folding machinery.</s>

          <s>Introduction Thioredoxins (Trx) and thioredoxin-like proteins (Tlp) are small ubiquitous proteins present throughout the tree of life.</s>
          <s>The members of the Trx-superfamily contain at least one Trxdomain, which forms a characteristic compact 3D structure known as the Trx-fold with a central twisted beta-sheet sandwiched by at least three alpha helices <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Some Trx and Tlps exhibit thiol-based redox activity facilitated by a [-CXXC-] active site motif located in the Trxdomain.</s>
          <s>A prominent example is the canonical Trx-1, a highly conserved cytosolic protein that contains a [-CGPC-] active site motif and functions as a cellular master redox regulator <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> .</s>
          <s>As such, Trx-1 has multiple target proteins in a variety of cellular pathways, such as antioxidant defense, nucleotide biosynthesis, transcription factors, and protein folding.</s>
          <s>For Trx-1 to be active it needs to be in its reduced state (Trx(SH) <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">2</ref> ).</s>
          <s>Trx-1 is supplied with reducing equivalents by NADPH via the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR).</s>
          <s>Together TrxR and Trx-1 form the Trx-system of a cell <ref type="figure">(Fig 1)</ref> .</s>

          <s>The protozoan parasite Plasmodium belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa and is the causative agent of the infectious disease Malaria.</s>
          <s>The parasite is transmitted between people by Anopheles mosquitoes.</s>
          <s>Initial studies of the Trx-system in Plasmodium focused on its role in antioxidant defense and parasite survival <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> .</s>
          <s>One goal of these studies was to identify potential anti-malarial drug targets <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Over time, new roles for the Trx-system were described as more Trx and Tlps were identified in the genomes of various Plasmodium species <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Studies have now expanded from the disease causing blood stages of Plasmodium in the human host to the developmental stages of the parasite inside the mosquito vector.</s>
          <s>Yet, our understanding of Plasmodium cell biology in the mosquito is still very limited.</s>
          <s>Plasmodium berghei is a prominent model organism for the study of malaria in mice and in mosquitoes <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>More than fifty genes in the P. berghei genome are currently annotated as putative Trx or Tlp due to the presence of a predicted Trx-domain.</s>
          <s>Those that have been experimentally characterized <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6,</ref>
            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7]</ref> are implemented in diverse cellular pathways, including nucleotide metabolism, antioxidant defense, redox signaling and red blood cell invasion <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> .</s>
          <s>We recently determined that three of the predicted Trx-domain containing genes belong to the phosducin family of proteins (PhLP) <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
          <s>PhLPs are highly conserved from yeast to mammals <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11,</ref>
            <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">12]</ref> and these Plasmodium genes represent the first identified in a protozoan organism <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>PhLPs represent a family of small Trx-domain containing proteins that exhibit the same basic structural organization consisting of an N-terminal helix domain followed by a Trxdomain and a short C-terminus <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref> .</s>
