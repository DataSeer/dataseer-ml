            <s>Both autophagy and podocyte epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are critical factors in glomerular diseases that involve proteinuria and fibrosis.</s>
            <s>Here, we sought to determine whether plant-derived saponin astragaloside IV (AS-IV) was able to reverse renal fibrosis and improve renal function through regulation of autophagy and podocyte EMT.</s>
            <s>Cultured immortalized mouse podocytes and KK-Ay mice models of diabetes were exposed to AS-IV.</s>
            <s>Western blotting, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and histochemistry were used to analyze markers of autophagy and podocyte EMT.</s>
            <s>We observed that AS-IV inhibited glucose-induced podocyte EMT and enhanced autophagy by decreasing NF-κB subunit p65 acetylation as well as increasing Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) expression.</s>
            <s>Treatment of the cells and animal models with a SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 was able to reverse these effects.</s>
            <s>The SIRT1 activator SRT1720 was also found to decrease p65 acetylation and enhance autophagy in glucose-induced podocyte EMT.</s>
            <s>Additionally, further treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was able to reverse the effects of AS-IV on podocyte EMT, while the autophagy activator rapamycin or the NF-κB pathway inhibitor ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were able to reverse glucose-induced podocyte EMT.</s>
            <s>Notably, both renal fibrosis and renal function in diabetic KK-Ay mice were improved after treatment with AS-IV.</s>
            <s>These findings support AS-IV as a renoprotective agent that likely exerts its effects on podocyte EMT through modulation of the SIRT1-NF-κB pathway and autophagy activation.</s>
            <s>Further studies are required to clarify the role of AS-IV as a potential therapeutic agent in glomerular diseases.</s>

          <s>Therefore, to further examine the impact of AS-IV on hyperglycemia-induced podocyte EMT, we first quantified TGF-β levels.</s>
          <s>AS-IV treatment (25, 50 and 100 μM) was found to significantly decrease TGF-β expression in podocytes exposed to glucose in a dose-dependent manner <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1B,C)</ref> .</s>
          <s>Podocytes were pretreated with high/normal glucose for 1 hour, and then incubated with or without AS-IV (25, 50 and 100 μM) for 48 hours.</s>
          <s>(B) mRNA expression levels of TGF-β were detected using real-time PCR.</s>
          <s>(C) TGF-β protein levels were quantified using Western blotting.</s>
          <s>(D) mRNA expression levels of α-SMA, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and nephrin were detected using real-time PCR.</s>
          <s>(E) Protein levels of α-SMA, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and nephrin were detected using Western blotting.</s>
          <s>Note: E-Ca, E-cadherin; N-Ca, N-cadherin.</s>
          <s>The molecular weight of the proteins: TGF-β, 44 kDa; nephrin, 100 kDa; E-cadherin, 110 kDa; N-cadherin, 100 kDa; α-SMA, 42 kDa.</s>

          <s>Further analysis of key EMT markers, mainly E-cadherin, epithelial marker nephrin, α-SMA and the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin revealed that AS-IV significantly raised the levels of E-cadherin and nephrin while suppressing levels of α-SMA and N-cadherin in podocytes exposed to hyperglycemic conditions in a dose-dependent manner <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">(Fig. 1D,E)</ref> .</s>
          <s>The results suggested that high glucose concentrations promoted podocyte EMT which was subsequently reversed upon exposure to AS-IV in a dose-dependent manner.</s>
          <s>Furthermore, mice kidneys were also found to positively express markers of podocyte EMT.</s>
          <s>In conclusion, AS-IV treatment was able to suppress TGF-β, N-cadherin and α-SMA levels while simultaneously increasing levels of nephrin and E-cadherin in contrast to untreated DKD mice <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> .</s>

(B-E) Podocytes were pretreated with high/normal glucose for 1 hour, and then incubated with or without AS-IV (25, 50 and 100 μM) for 48 hours. (B) mRNA expression levels of TGF-β were detected using real-time PCR. (C) TGF-β protein levels were quantified using Western blotting. (D) mRNA expression levels of α-SMA, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and nephrin were detected using real-time PCR. (E) Protein levels of α-SMA, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and nephrin were detected using Western blotting. Note: E-Ca, E-cadherin; N-Ca, N-cadherin. The molecular weight of the proteins: TGF-β, 44 kDa; nephrin, 100 kDa; E-cadherin, 110 kDa; N-cadherin, 100 kDa; α-SMA, 42 kDa. Data is presented as mean ± SD. n = 3. *Compared with normal glucose cohort or AS-IV cohort, P &lt; 0.05;</figDesc>
