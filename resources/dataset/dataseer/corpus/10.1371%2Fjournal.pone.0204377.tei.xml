          <s>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref> In 2013, there were 910,809 deaths from COPD in China, accounting for 31.1% of the total deaths from COPD in the world.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States and the major cost driver in COPD.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref> Correctly assessing the severity of AECOPD and providing proper treatment has important clinical significance and socioeconomic benefit.</s>
          <s>At present, there is no unified and objective standard for assessing AECOPD severity and its progression using a clinical application.</s>
          <s>The clinical presentation of COPD exacerbation is heterogeneous; thus, the report from 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the standards for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD document that were published in 2004 by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society both recommend that the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs, and they recommend the following three classifications: Level I: No respiratory failure (treated at home); Level II: Acute respiratory failure-non life threatening (requires hospitalization); and Level III: Acute respiratory failure-life threatening (leads to respiratory failure).</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref>
            <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5]</ref> Although this classification method can help physicians classify AECOPD patients with various severities in the outpatient department and emergency ward, it is difficult to popularize this system in clinical practice because of the numerous items and difficulty in remembering the criteria.</s>
          <s>Thus, a rapid and convenient method or biomarker is needed to aid the assessment of severity and individual risk.</s>
          <s>This area is a primary focus in current research in AECOPD.</s>

        <p>
          <s>The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is the ratio of neutrophils (NEU) to lymphocytes (LYM) in peripheral blood.</s>
          <s>The NLR is being increasingly studied as a systemic inflammatory marker, particularly because it is a relatively inexpensive and widely available assessment tool obtained in a routine blood count analysis.</s>
          <s>The NLR has been studied in the ICU as an inflammatory biomarker.</s>
          <s>It has a good correlation with the severity of clinical course in patients, in line with APACHE-II and SOFA scores.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref> Studies have identified the NLR as an inflammatory indicator that can effectively predict the prognosis of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.</s>

            <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>
            <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>
            <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> In addition, a study of emergency patients showed that the NLR is a better predictor of bacteremia than routine parameters like C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count and NEU count.</s>
          <s>
            <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref> An additional two studies on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) confirmed that the NLR predicts the severity of CAP with a higher prognostic accuracy than is achieved by traditional infection markers, such as WBC, NEU and CRP.</s>

          <s>Some studies have evaluated the application of NLR in AECOPD patients, but most of them have used the NLR as an indicator of exacerbation.</s>
          <s>For example, Mahsuk Taylan et al. found that the NLR is a novel marker of exacerbation in patients with COPD.</s>
          <s>

          <s>
            <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref> COPD is associated with chronic inflammation that predominantly affects the lung parenchyma and peripheral airways, resulting in largely irreversible and progressive airflow limitation.</s>
          <s>This inflammation is characterized by an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages, NEU, T lymphocytes, and innate lymphoid cells.</s>
          <s>

        </p>

          <s>This conclusion is consistent with the research by Mahsuk Taylan et al. <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref> Their study indicated that traditional markers (CRP, ESR and WBC) were helpful in assessing exacerbated COPD but that the NLR provided more sensitivity.</s>
