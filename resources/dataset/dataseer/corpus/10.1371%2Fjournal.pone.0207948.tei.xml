          <s>Here, we used well-characterized misfolding-prone α1(A322D) subunits to evaluate how remodeling the ER proteostasis network influences their maturation by applying a chemical that specifically enhances the expression level of ER-resident HSP70 family protein BiP or enhancing the folding capacity through activating two major UPR branches: the ATF6 pathway or the IRE1 pathway.</s>
          <s>Our results showed that the specific BiP activator, BIX, promotes the folding, trafficking and importantly functional surface expression of α1(A322D) (Figs 2I, 3A, and 4A).</s>
          <s>BIX also enhances surface expression level of α1(D219N) <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">(Fig 3C)</ref> .</s>

            <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">58]</ref> , the improved surface trafficking of α1(A322D) and α1(D219N) by BIX treatment could arise from enhanced subunit interactions and subunit assembly efficiency on the ER membrane.</s>
          <s>Currently, many of the fundamental questions about how the proteostasis network regulates the assembly process of multi-subunit membrane proteins in the ER remain to be answered.</s>
          <s>Therefore, the characterization of the chaperone-assisted assembly process of these membrane proteins could open a new way to promote their surface trafficking.</s>
          <s>BIX has significant neuron-protective effects in brain ischemia mice model <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">[51,</ref>

          <s>Furthermore, previously we showed that inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCP) and SAHA treatment are able to enhance functional surface expression of α1(A322D) mutant receptors by attenuating the ERAD, increasing the synthesis, and/or promoting folding and trafficking of mutant receptors <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37,</ref>
            <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">59]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, a combination usage of BIX and these mechanistically distinct proteostasis regulators could potentially improve the functional rescue of quite malignant mutant receptors, which merits future investigations.</s>
          <s>In addition, pharmacological chaperones directly bind to their target protein to stabilize it in a protein-pharmacological chaperone state <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[60]</ref> .</s>
          <s>It was reported that pharmacological chaperones up-regulated the surface expression of several Cys-loop receptors, including neuronal acetylcholine receptors <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[61]</ref> and GABA A receptors <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[62]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Therefore, co-application of pharmacological chaperones and BIX has the promise to further promote functional surface expression of mutant receptors.</s>

          <s>Both the IRE1 pathway and the ATF6 activation remodel the ER proteostasis network to enhance the folding of the α1(A322D) subunit, enabling its successful transport to the plasma membrane.</s>
          <s>Interestingly, previous studies showed that activating ATF6 reduces the secretion and extracellular aggregation of the amyloidogenic protein transthyretin by enhancing ER quality control stringency and thus ERAD <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">[44]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Here, we showed that ATF6 activation enhances the forward trafficking of mutant α1(A322D) subunits.</s>

          <s>Consistently, we showed that BIX treatment is sufficient to enhance the surface trafficking of α1 (D219N).</s>

          <s>Because BIX treatment or BiP overexpression is sufficient to enhance the forward trafficking of α1(A322D) subunits <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref> , one possibility is that BiP is able to stabilize the ER lumen domain of α1(A322D) subunits, allowing more time for the insertion of TM3 into the lipid bilayers.</s>
          <s>Such a possibility is also supported by our recent report that inhibiting VCP to slow down the ERAD of α1 (A322D) subunits can enhance their forward trafficking <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[59]</ref> .</s>
          <s>Alternatively, BiP is able to directly stabilize the TM3 segment after TM3 is exposed to the ER lumen.</s>

          <s>Another example is the ER luminal UDPglucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase UGGT1, which reglucosylate the partially folded glycoproteins to re-enter the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycles <ref target="#b67" type="bibr">[68]</ref> .</s>

(A) HEK293T cells expressing α1(A322D)β2γ2 receptors were treated with BIX (12 μM, 24 h) or DMSO vehicle control. Then the cell surface proteins were tagged with biotin using membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent sulfo-NHS SS-Biotin. Biotinylated surface proteins were affinity-purified using neutravidin-conjugated beads and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The Na + /K + -ATPase serves as a surface protein loading control. Quantification of normalized surface α1(A322D) protein levels to the Na + /K + -ATPase controls is shown in (B) (n = 5, paired t-test).
