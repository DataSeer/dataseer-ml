Careful de-identification (removal of personally identifying data such as birthdates) and/or anonymization needs to happen prior to sharing or deposition in a repository. Consultation with your ethics review board is required to determine what level of de-identification or anonymization is needed in your specific case.

Analyte molecules are embedded in an excess matrix of small organic molecules that show a high resonant absorption at the laser wavelength used. The matrix absorbs the laser energy, thus inducing a soft disintegration of the sample-matrix mixture into free (gas phase) matrix and analyte molecules and molecular ions. In general, only molecular ions of the analyte molecules are produced, and almost no fragmentation occurs. This makes the method well suited for molecular weight determinations and mixture analysis."
