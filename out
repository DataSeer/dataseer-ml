matched sentence! The p53 peptide with the wild-type sequence, the phosphorylated peptides at Thr18 and Ser20, and the double phosphorylated one at Thr18 and Ser20 were purchased from Genscript (New Jersey, USA) with a purity higher than 95% as determined by mass spectrometry; phosphorylation at those positions was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy (see below for further details).
matched sentence! Protein purity was higher than 95% as determined by SDS PAGE gels.
matched sentence! Fluorescence spectra were collected on a Perkin Elmer LSB55 spectrofluorimeter (Perkin Elmer, USA), interfaced with a bath, at 15 °C.
matched sentence! Spectra were acquired on a Jasco J815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan) interfaced with a Peltier unit.
matched sentence! Far-UV measurements (in aqueous or TFE solutions) were performed in 0.1-cm-pathlength quartz cells (Hellma), with a response time of 2 s, a band width of 1 nm, data were collected every 0.2 nm, and a scan velocity of 50 nm/min (or 20 nm/ min).
matched sentence! NMR experiments were performed at 10 °C on a Bruker Avance DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker GmbH, Germany), equipped with a triple resonance probe and z-pulse field gradients.
matched sentence! The pH of the samples was measured before and after the experiments with an ultra-thin electrode (Sigma-Aldrich).
matched sentence! Standard DQF-COSY (double quantum-filter correlation spectroscopy), TOCSY (80 ms), ROESY (rotating frame spectroscopy) (200 ms and 300 ms) and NOESY (Nuclear Overhuaser effect spectroscopy) (200 ms and 300 ms) experiments were acquired.
matched sentence! ITC experiments were performed at 15 °C rather than 25 °C to avoid aggregation of MDM2.
matched sentence! The kinetics of the MDM2/p53-peptide interaction was measured at 15 °C using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow fluorimeter in the same buffer as that used in the equilibrium fluorescence experiments.
matched sentence! Association kinetics was measured under pseudo-first order conditions, by keeping the MDM2 concentration in excess of that of the peptide.
