Labeling yield and radiochemical purity was analyzed by instant thin layered chromatography (ITLC).
NOESY and ROESY spectra64,65 were collected with typically 128 scans per t1 increment, with the residual water signal removed by the WATERGATE sequence and 1 s relaxation time.
The concentrations of Cd and Pb in feathers were measured by furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (VARIAN 240Z).
